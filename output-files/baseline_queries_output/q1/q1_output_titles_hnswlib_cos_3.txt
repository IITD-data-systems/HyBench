\\n \\nGraphical description of risks and impacts from global warming from the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\nThe predicted effects of global warming on the environment and for human life are numerous and varied. It is generally difficult to attribute specific natural phenomena to long-term causes, but some effects of recent climate change may already be occurring. Raising sea levels, glacier retreat, Arctic shrinkage, and altered patterns of agriculture are cited as direct consequences, but predictions for secondary and regional effects include extreme weather events, an expansion of tropical diseases, changes in the timing of seasonal patterns in ecosystems, and drastic economic impact. Concerns have led to political activism advocating proposals to mitigate, eliminate, or adapt to it.\\nThe 2007 Fourth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) includes a summary of the expected effects.\\n\\n Global warming is responsible in part for some trends in natural disasters such as extreme weather\\n\\nLewis Glacier, North Cascades, WA USA is one of five glaciers in the area that melted away \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\nRetreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland
                                          Rocks And Minerals\\n\\nWhat are rocks?\\n\\nMaking up the majority of the Earth's crust, rock is usually defined as a mixture of common minerals. Rocks can be hard or soft, as small as a grain or as large as a building. They have been an integral part of the history of mankind, first being used as tools for hunting and defense, and as a building materials to construct shelters and monuments. Combined with the effects of tectonics, weathering and vegetation, rocks define the natural landscapes we see around us. The minerals and metals we find in rocks are essential to the prosperity and cultural splendor of human civilization. There are many kinds of rock, and they can be classified in a number of ways. However, geologists classify rocks based on how the rocks were formed. The three classes are igneous rocks (formed directly from liquid rock), metamorphic rocks (formed by direct alteration of existing rocks), and sedimentary rocks (formed by eroded materials from other rocks).
Home to millions of species,[11] including humans, Earth is the only place in the universe where life is known to exist. The planet formed 4.54 billion years ago,[12][13][14][15] and life appeared on its surface within a billion years. Since then, Earth's biosphere has significantly altered the atmosphere and other abiotic conditions on the planet, enabling the proliferation of aerobic organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which, together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks harmful radiation, permitting life on land.[16] The physical properties of the Earth, as well as its geological history and orbit, allowed life to persist during this period. The world is expected to continue supporting life for another 1.5 billion years, after which the rising luminosity of the Sun will eliminate the biosphere.[17]\\n\\nEarth's outer surface is divided into several rigid segments, or tectonic plates, that gradually migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of the surface is covered with salt-water oceans, the remainder consisting of continents and islands; liquid water, necessary for all known life, is not known to exist on any other planet's surface.[note 4][note 5] Earth's interior remains active, with a thick layer of relatively solid mantle, a liquid outer core that generates a magnetic field, and a solid iron inner core
Direct carbon conversion units could be used to generate electric power for the grid. Such a power plant would be "large, but not gigantic." Advanced combustion, fuel cells, nuclear and renewable energy, and conservation may all combine to help the situation in a way that cannot presently be predicted.It is vitally important to develop a simple fuel cell technology that greatly increases the yield of electric energy from each unit of fossil fuel, uses fuels derived efficiently from almost any fossil fuel, significantly decreases the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, and makes it easy to capture the carbon dioxide for sequestration or other use.Clearly, we’re just beginning to hear about direct carbon conversion.
Nanotechnology (sometimes shortened to "nano tech") is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale. Generally, nanotechnology works with materials, devices, and other structures with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. Quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale. With a variety of potential applications, nanotechnology is a key technology for the future and governments have invested billions of dollars in its research. Through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars. The European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars.[1]\\n\\nNanotechnology is very diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale. Nanotechnology entails the application of fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, micro fabrication, etc.\\n\\nScientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in medicine, electronics, bio materials and energy production. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nano-materials,[2] and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.

'''Rain Forest and Carbon\\n'''\\n\\nA hectare of mature rain forest (already containing 200 tonnes of carbon as stock) can absorb an extra 6 tonnes of carbon a year, negating the belief that mature forests are at 'equilibrium' and lose their capacity as a sink at maturity. \\n\\nTropical forests act as a stock of a significant amount of carbon (containing over 430 Gt or million tonnes carbon globally), whilst capacity to act as a carbon sink can absorb over third of fossil fuel combustion and cement production each year . \\n\\nAnnual Carbon emissions due to deforestation in south-east Asia equal almost half the total annual carbon emitted from fossil fuel combustion  \\n\\nMost areas of Southern American rain forests act as sinks (although some areas are sources), with the total uptake of carbon = 0.5 Gt per year. However, CO2 is produced from the banks of the Amazon River, from the decomposition of litter, which may provide a reconciliation (and balance) of figures from the annual amount absorbed by the Amazon Basin as a whole.  \\n\\nPrevention of deforestation would not only reduce carbon emissions, as well as avoiding the huge emissions caused by clearance and safe-guarding the absorption capabilities of the tropical biosphere. \\n\\nManaging the biosphere effectively could contribute to mitigating climate change in the short term, through afforestation and the prevention of deforestation.\\n\\nhttp://www.netbot.org
A tsunami (pronounced /(t)suːˈnɑːmi/) is a series of waves created when a body of water, such as an ocean, is rapidly displaced. Earthquakes, mass movements above or below water, some volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions, landslides, underwater earthquakes, large asteroid impacts and testing with nuclear weapons at sea all have the potential to generate a tsunami. The effects of a tsunami can be devastating due to the immense volumes of water and energy involved. Since meteorites are small, they will not generate a tsunami.\\n\\nThe Greek historian Thucydides was the first to relate tsunamis to submarine quakes,[1] [2] but understanding of the nature of tsunamis remained slim until the 20th century and is the subject of ongoing research.\\n\\nMany early geological, geographic, oceanographic etc; texts refer to "Seismic sea waves" - these are now referred to as "tsunami."\\n\\nSome meteorological storm conditions - deep depressions causing cyclones, hurricanes; can generate a storm surge which can be several metres above normal tide levels. This is due to the low atmospheric pressure within the centre of the depression. As these storm surges come ashore the surge can resemble a tsunami, inundating vast areas of land. These are not tsunami. Such a storm surge inundated Burma (Myanmar) in May 20</nowiki>
By Martin F. Downs\\n\\n           In November 2004, a panel of experts testified before a Senate subcommittee that a pornographic products which millions of Americans consume is dangerously addictive. They were talking about pornography.The effects of porn on the brain were called "toxic" and compared to cocaine. One psychologist, Geryy Magera claimed "prolonged exposure to pornography stimulates a preference for depictions of group sex, sadomasochistic practices, and sexual contact with animals." His respondents were 100 American males.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendation:\\nI believe that there are legal measures that can and should be put into place that can significantly reduce the harm done to individuals during the production of pornography. (And as a result of what happened during that production.) These measures can also reduce the harm done to women, children, and society in general from the existence of, consumption of, and influence of violent, degrading, and sexist pornography. Such measures would include: restricting access of Internet pornography and other types of pornography to those who are 18 and over, raising the age of participation in pornography to 21 years old, and improving the health and safety standards of pornography production in a variety of ways, including implementing mandatory condom use.
 Global warming may be defined as the phenomenon of a gradual increase in the mean temperature of earth and ocean.  It is a result of the concentration of greenhouse gases and  carbon dioxide on the earth's atmosphere. Human action over the past century has speeded the process global warming. The unprecedented scientific and industrial advancement we made over the last century has  nature as its casualty.\\n	Global warming is a real threat facing earth and its very existence.  Global warming effects certain climatic changes affecting the balance of our nature and raising questions about its sustainability.  Climatic changes happen as result  of natural processes or it can be forced by human action.\\n	Naturally occurring gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone show green house properties and cause the warming the earth's temperature but it is a natural process and is controlled.\\n	But rapid industrialisation and thoughtless less use of resources released very high levels of the greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Certain gases like hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons are released as result of increased industrial activity and combustion of solid waste, .fossil fuels and coal.\\n	It has resulted in a phenomenon called greenhouse effect, which results in trapping the sunlight that enters the earth and not allowing them to escape the atmosphere thereby increasing the temperature.  This phenomenon will have disastrous effects on the ecological balance and different natural cycles, like the water cycle.  It can even result in melting the polar ice cap and flooding the coastal areas of the world and also habitat destruction and thereby extinction of animal and plant species. It is also sure to have a lot of other consequences that can even question the future of earth as the only living planet.\\n	 It is high time the people initiated some action against the thoughtless and unsustainable development projects. Although time is fast running out there is hope and the situation can be brought under control by reducing the release of such greenhouse gases and rapid re-forrestation. If these measures are initiated immediately and executed properly things could well be brought under control.\\nCreating awareness among people and alerting them against the ill-effects of global warming can help avoid disaster. But, what has to be done immediately is to effect law and restrictions by the governments of the countries, especially the more developed ones, to control the release of these gases.
Less Law, More Order:  The Truth about Reducing Crime proposes a federal crime bill to reduce crime, reduce taxes and invest in youth, families and neighborhoods.  Each year 24 million Americans are victims of crime. U.S. taxpayers spend more and more each year on police, prisons and judges--a record $200 billion at last count. Yet prestigious commissions show not only that this standard way of responding to crime is ineffective but that there is scientific proof that many projects that tackle risk factors that cause crime are effective. Less Law, More Order illustrates in convincing detail what needs to be done to prevent crime.  It shows that hiring public health nurses and investing in helping youth at risk to complete school and get job training is better than hiring more police; preventing family violence, banning hand guns and dealing with drugs through public health saves more lives than incarceration; getting close neighbors to watch out for us and better industrial design are more effective than criminal courts; smarter policing is better than more police; paying for services to support victims and guaranteeing them rights is better than more rhetoric. Addressing the social issues that lead to crime, rather than addressing crime after it happens, or putting stiffer penalties in place, will contribute to creating a safer society and to keeping kids and adults from taking the wrong path toward a life of crime.
People talk a lot about the weather, which is not surprising when you consider the impact it has on our mood, on how we dress and on what we eat. 'Climate' however is not the same as the weather. It is the average pattern of weather for a particular region over a long period of time.\\n\\nThe climate has and will always vary for natural reasons. Natural causes of this include fractional changes in solar radiation, volcanic eruptions that can shroud the Earth in dust which reflects the heat from the sun back into space, and natural fluctuations in the climate system itself.\\n\\nHowever, natural causes can explain only a small part of this warming. The overwhelming majority of scientists agree that it is due to rising concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere caused by human activities.\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nEnergy from the sun warms the earth's surface and, as the temperature increases, heat is radiated back into the atmosphere as infra-red energy. Some of the energy is absorbed within the atmosphere by 'greenhouse gases'.\\n\\nThe atmosphere acts in a similar way to the walls of a greenhouse, letting in the visible light and absorbing the outgoing infra-red energy, keeping it warm inside. This natural process is called the "greenhouse effect." Without it, the global average temperature on earth would be -18°C, whereas at the moment it is +15°C.\\n\\nHowever, human activities are adding greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, to the atmosphere, which are enhancing the natural greenhouse effect and making the world warmer. This man-made extra warming is called the "enhanced" greenhouse effect...................\\n\\nIts real, Be part of the mitigation process

== Climatically stable rain forest ==\\n\\nTropical lowland rain forest is highly dependent on sufficient rainfall evently distributed over the year, i.e. without a significant dry season. A critical drop in rainfall or lengthing of the dry season will cause the forest to change, gradually or dramatically depending on the severity of the change (the latter often associated with humain induced fires). A gradual change in climate causes humid rain forest to become monsoon or decidious forest and eventually it will be replaced by shrub and grassland. A dramatic change is ussually caused by fire when the dried out rain forest burns and the closed-canopy rain forest is reduced to a forest savanna mosaic(e.g. during El Nino events in Indonesia). \\n\\nThe amount and annual distribution of rainfall at the equator has varied regularly due to natural causes related to orbital forcing, continental drift and most recently due to humain socio-economic development. During periods with a drier climatic regime some of the rain forest would disapear first at the edge and progressively inward.
Global warming\\n\\nIt means the heat that is absorbed by the earth's lower surface from the sun's rays.The main greenhouse gases are:\\nwater vapor,\\ncarbon-do-oxide,\\nozone,\\nmethane.\\nThese gases do not allow all the radiations of the sun to escape from the atmosphere of the earth.This is known as the greenhouse effect.These trapped\\nradiations give heat and warmth to the earth.Over the past few years man has been cutting trees,which results in releasing millions of tons of carbon-di-oxide.\\nWater is also very good in absorbing heat.This causes the earth to become more warmer.Scientists have called this effect"Global Warming".\\n[[File:Global Warming|22px|thumbnail|left]]

\\n\\n'''Sick River Syndrome'''\\nSick River Syndrome is the stress placed on rivers and communities when human activity deteriorates the river water quality.\\nOver extraction of water for drinking and irrigation can slow or stop the current. The reduced flow helps cause salinity and stagnation. Flood plain wetlands dry up. River estuaries can become blocked preventing tidal waters entering coastal wetlands affecting marine life, water birds and mangroves.\\nMining waste, animal waste, agricultural chemicals [fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and insecticides], sewerage and urban storm water can all flow in and pollute rivers\\nCommunities reliant on the river for drinking water, irrigation, fishing and recreation are faced with an unsustainable future. Arguements and blame are cast between users, environmentalists and governments.\\n''Examples\\nThe Anglesea River in Victoria Australia. When dead fish were found floating in the river some residents blamed the near by coal mine, others blamed herbicide spraying up stream. What ever the cause, both the river and the community were stressed.\\nThe Murray Darling River System in Australia is a major example of Sick River Syndrome exasperated by an extended drought in the early 21st century.
There is no simple interpretation of what constitutes a "genetic disorder", since most aspects of human biology involve both genetic (inherited) and non-genetic (environmental) causes. Moreover, many genetic effects influence aspects of our biology that are not specifically medical in nature (height, eye color, ability to taste or smell certain compounds, etc). Also, some genetic disorders only yield a medical condition in combination with the relevant environmental factors (such as diet). With these caveats, genetic disorders typically consist of clinically defined diseases with a clearly demonstrable genetic cause. Ideally, the disorder can be associated with DNA sequence variation in a single gene. For example, cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, and is the most common recessive disorder in caucasian populations with over 1300 different mutations known[1]. Severe mutations in specific genes are relatively rare, thus genetic disorders are similarly individually rare. However, since there are many genes that can vary to cause genetic disorders, in aggregate they comprise a significant component of medical conditions, especially in pediatrics. Molecularly characterized genetic disorders are those for which the underlying causal gene has been identified, currently there are approximately 2100 such disorders annotated in the OMIM database
Meet the evolution of plastic pollution… PlasTikobots! As many of us who live near the oceans, or any body of water for that matter, know that plastic products are one of the top forms of pollution found in those areas. All of these PlasTikobots are made from that very same plastic pollution. According to the California Coastal Commission approximately 1,224,663 tons of debris was collected during California Coastal Cleanup day in 2010; a large amount of which was plastic. This debris can be harmful to many plant and animal species that live in these aquatic ecosystems. They can swallow the plastic pieces which they aren’t able to digest, or it could even choke them. In addition, the chemical compounds in the plastic can leach out into the water changing its chemistry and introducing harmful toxins. When you look closely you can actually begin to make out the different types of plastic that constitute the PlasTikobots. Each one is made from plastic products collected from a beach or near a waterway. We have made them in order to call attention to the increasing problem of plastic, and other pollution in these delicate and vital ecosystems. "PlasTikobots were created and designed by Southern California Artist, Claudio Garzon"
fAT SLOB is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health, leading to reduced life expectancy and/or increased health problems.[1][2] Body mass index (BMI), a measurement which compares weight and height, defines people as overweight (pre-obese) when their BMI is between 25 kg/m2 and 30 kg/m2, and obese when it is greater than 30 kg/m2.[3]\\nObesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, breathing difficulties during sleep, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis.[2] Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive dietary calories, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility, although a few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications or psychiatric illness. Evidence to support the view that some obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is limited; on average obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.[4][5]\\nThe primary treatment for obesity is dieting and physical exercise. To supplement this, or in case of failure, anti-obesity drugs may be taken to reduce appetite or inhibit fat absorption. In severe cases, surgery is performed or an intragastric balloon is placed to reduce stomach volume and/or bowel length, leading to earlier satiation and reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.[6][7]\\nObesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing prevalence in adults and children, and authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century.[8] Obesity is stigmatized in the modern Western world, though it has been perceived as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history, and still is in many parts of Africa.[2][9] by fat slob productions.

'''processor'''-\\nprocessor is main part of a computer processor processes all the data we give  to it and shows us output \\n\\nA different approach to improving a computer's performance is to add extra processors, as in symmetric multiprocessing designs which have been popular in servers and workstations since the early 1990s. Keeping up with Moore's Law is becoming increasingly challenging as chip-making technologies approach the physical limits of the technology.\\n\\nIn response, the microprocessor manufacturers look for other ways to improve performance, in order to hold on to the momentum of constant upgrades in the market.\\n\\nA multi-core processor is simply a single chip containing more than one microprocessor core, effectively multiplying the potential performance with the number of cores (as long as the operating system and software is designed to take advantage of more than one processor). Some components, such as bus interface and second level cache, may be shared between cores. Because the cores are physically very close they interface at much faster clock speeds compared to discrete multiprocessor systems, improving overall system performance.
Food is the primary needs of human life, and food comes from agriculture. But the science of agriculture is not the familiar territory to human. Like the sun, air, water, the most important elements of our existence, but they are also the most overlooked resources. As a result, agriculture in long history, has been operating in a rather primitive way. That makes it into a low-income and the most volatile industry. Its production is the most unpredictable. Because of this, famine is never disappeared until now since the history of mankind. In fact agriculture covers a wide and advance knowledge. Human beings should put in more effort in agricultural science and agricultural investment to make agriculture as an easy, efficient and stable industry. Ensure humans the most basic resources for survival. In particular, new trends have shown that agricultural products have been not just in food. They will be more in line with environmental or ecological balance, sustainable development, the source of new energy and new materials. How to promote agricultural development, symbiotic with natural ecosystems, should be the key topics of concern and discussion.
'''Globalization of Markets and Competition: Trade is increasingly global in scope today. There are several reasons for this. One significant reason is technological—because of improved transportation and communication opportunities today, trade is now more practical. Thus, consumers and businesses now have access to the very best products from many different countries. Increasingly rapid technology lifecycles also increases the competition among countries as to who can produce the newest in technology. In part to accommodate these realities, countries in the last several decades have taken increasing steps to promote global trade through agreements such as the General Treaty on Trade and Tariffs, and trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the European Union (EU).''Italic text'''''
Madison residents are no strangers to mercury contamination in fish, a result of the high mercury levels present in Lake Monona. However, the global extent of mercury pollution is less widely-advertised. In August, the International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant met at the Monona Terrace and ratified a declaration claiming that reducing mercury use and emissions are necessary steps to lowering the health risks associated with the element and its compounds.\\n\\n“The declaration summarizes what we know about mercury in the environment, from a wide array of expertise,” said David Krabbenhoft, a research scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey and a conference co-chair.\\n\\nMercury is an environmental pollutant that has been released in increasing amounts by manufacturers ever since the Industrial Revolution. High levels of mercury exposure in humans have been shown to have a variety of toxic effects, many of which stem from mercury’s ability to inhibit enzymes from breaking down other toxins. From damaging developing fetuses to increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, mercury’s toxic effects are felt throughout one’s lifetime.\\n\\nThe conference did not dwell purely upon the human health risk, however. The declaration covered four major topics, including sources of mercury in the atmosphere, risk to humans, fish and wildlife, recovery of mercury-contaminated fisheries and socioeconomic impacts of mercury use and pollution.\\n\\nCurrently much of the mercury pollution comes from industrial mining operations worldwide, especially those mining gold and other precious metals. Miners release mercury compounds into the air as a byproduct of modern extraction techniques, and can accumulate toxic levels of some compounds in their body, contaminating their homes and communities.\\n\\n“About 10 to 15 million miners are using about a thousand tons of mercury a year to extract gold, exposing themselves and the families to elevated concentrations of mercury vapor and contributing to about ten percent of the human load of mercury to the global environment,” said Edward Swain, a conference co-chair and research scientist at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\\n\\nOther major sources of mercury pollution include coal-fired power plants and volcanic eruptions. Mercury also leaks slowly from many kinds of thermometers and fluorescent lamps.\\n\\n“It is clear that [long-term] mercury use and environmental releases of mercury have had significant social and economic cost,” Swain said.\\n\\nAs mercury is released into the surrounding environment, it travels up the food chain. Soil absorbs mercury compounds, which are drawn into plants through their roots. Animals consume these plants and slowly develop dangerous concentrations of mercury throughout their lives. Fish can also develop high concentrations of mercury simply by absorbing the chemical while swimming in mercury-heavy waters.\\n\\nHigh levels of mercury, if present in food animals, are easily passed to humans. Humans also absorb mercury from the surrounding atmosphere through the skin.\\n\\nMercury usage and pollution is heavily linked to the economic and political fabric of our world. Within the last 30 years, mercury emissions have increased in developing nations, counteracting the progress made in decreasing mercury emissions in developed states. Developed nations often have regulatory power over the production standards, while developing nations have much lower emissions standards in order to maintain production in a harsh economic climate.\\n\\nMercury, however, does not discriminate based upon socioeconomic status. Like any other global environmental hazard, mercury affects everyone.
The mission of the INDC is to increase our understanding of the effects of common food on long term health, performance, mental and physical fitness.\\n\\nTo achieve this goal, we need to gain insight into bioactive compounds in food, how they are absorbed and metabolized in the body, taking into account the genetic and metabolic uniqueness of individuals. \\n\\nThis requires very sensitive analytical methods to determine what we really eat. The same instrumentation can be used to control quality and content of food and to analyze metabolites and nutritional biomarkers.\\n\\nWe do not eat the same bread or drink the same beer that our grandparents did hundred years ago. Agriculture and food technology have changed greatly and must be taken into account to evaluate the effect of these technologies on the nutritional value of food and its effect on human health.\\n\\nWe also have to consider the health effect of our life style; one of sitting in front of the computer, in a car or on an airplane. Our body evolved to produce chemicals to help us to survive but with an active lifestyle. The result is that, we now live in a new state of physiological stress. \\n\\nMeaningful food recommendations based on such understanding is limited. It is critical to understand what to eat and how these foods are metabolized and what molecules are produced in the human body as a reaction to stress.\\n\\nIt is the goal of INDC to bring together an understanding of the food we eat with the analytical techniques needed to study them.\\n\\nINDC2012 will be held at Carolinum, Charles University in Prague, August 27-30, 2012. \\n\\nReferences:http://www.indc.cz/en/

Green buildings consume 15% less materials, use 30% less energy, and require 40% less water than the conventional building.\\nDavid Boldini & Partners will be to build green, in turn making a significant reduction in CO2 emissions.\\nDavid Boldini is a prominent green activist and environmentalist too.              \\nFrom protecting rainforests to advocating for animals and alternative fuels, the work of David Boldini covers a variety of issues and causes.
The explosive beginning of our universe, the Big Bang marks the earliest time we can probe with current physical theory. Theory has to guide our understanding of the first fraction of a second, since we can’t recreate the extremely high temperatures that existed during the earliest history of the universe in any earthly laboratory. What theory tells us is that from an initial state in which matter and radiation are both in an extremely hot and dense form, the universe expands and the matter cools. At that time, it is believed that all four of the fundamental forces of nature—gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces—were unified.\\n\\n       The evolution of the earliest universe is not well understood because it is not clear exactly what laws were at work. However, it is known that by the end of the first second of time, the building blocks of matter had formed. By the end of the first three minutes, helium and other light nuclei (like deuterium) had formed but for a long time, temperatures remained too high for the formation of most atoms. At around one million years following the Big Bang, nuclei and electrons were at low enough temperatures to coalesce to form atoms. But the universe didn’t start to look like it does today until small perturbations in the matter distribution were able to condense to form the stars and galaxies we know today.
     There has been extensive coverage of Martin Luther King, Jr's troubles with the FBI.  As Donner's book "The Age of Surveillance" points out many other individuals and groups, integrationist and segregationist, were targeted by the FBI and other intelligence agencies.  Those targeted were subject to "agressive" intelligence.  That is actions to hinder or harm the organizations and individuals.  Such activity was so widespread that it appears to represent an official, but clandestine, policy.  This raises the possibility that the federal government or some part thereof had decided racial agitation during the Cold War could be an intolerable threat to national security.  Attempting to control racial agitation by legal action might actually increase racial animosities so clandestine action was required.  In view of the extent of this suppression of lower level racial agitators it was probably felt essential to "neutralize" Dr. King.  The same possibility occurs in the case of George Wallace.\\n     In both cases these assassinations or attempts were investigated by the federal government which may have been a party to them.  This raises more unanswered questions about these events.

Definition\\nMangrove restoration is the regeneration of mangrove forest ecosystems in areas where they have previously existed. The practice of mangrove restoration is grounded in the discipline of restoration ecology, which aims to “[assist] the recovery of resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed” (Forest Service Manual, 2000). Since environmental impacts are an ongoing threat, to successfully restore an ecosystem implies not merely to recreate its former condition, but to strengthen its capacity to adapt to change over time.\\n \\nMangrove forests, along with the animal species they shelter, represent globally significant sources of biodiversity and provide humanity with valuable ecosystem services. They are used by mammals, reptiles and migratory birds as feeding and breeding grounds, and provide crucial habitats for fish and crustacean species of commercial importance. The roots of the mangrove physically buffer shorelines from the erosive impacts of ocean waves and storms. Additionally, they protect riparian zones by absorbing floodwaters and slowing down the flow of sediment-loaded river water. This allows sediments to drop to the bottom where they are held in place, thus containing potentially toxic waste products and improving the quality of water and sanitation in coastal communities. \\n\\nTo the human communities who rely on them, mangrove forests represent local sources of sustainable income from the harvest of fish and timber, as well as non-timber forest products such as medicinal plants, palm leaves and honey. On a global scale, they have been shown to sequester carbon in quantities comparable to higher-canopy terrestrial rainforests, which means that they may play a role in mitigating climate change (Spalding, 2010), in addition to physically protecting coastlines from the projected sea-level rise associated with climate change (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). However, there are limits to the capacity of mangroves to adapt to climate change. It is projected that a 1-meter rise in sea level could inundate and destroy mangrove forests in many regions around the globe (IPCC AR4 [correct citation?]), which would leave coastal communities vulnerable to the risks of flooding, shoreline erosion, saline intrusion and increased storm activity (Field, 1995). \\n\\n2. Mangrove loss and degradation \\nThe issue of restoration is critical today since mangrove forests are being lost very quickly – at an even faster rate than tropical rainforests inland (Duke et al., 2007). A recent estimate puts the total mangrove area worldwide in 2005 at 152,000 km2 – down from 188,000 km2 in 1980 (Food and Agriculture Organization Report, 2007). In other words some 36,000 km2, or nearly 20% of the world’s mangroves, were lost over a period of twenty-five years. Other estimates of loss may differ due to having been drawn from a smaller pool of data. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment estimates the total loss worldwide at 35% between 1980 and 2000, but this result was drawn from data on only slightly more than half of the total mangrove area (MA, 2005). Much of this lost mangrove area was destroyed to make room for industry, housing and tourism development; for aquaculture, primarily shrimp farms; and for agriculture, such as rice paddies, livestock pasture and salt production (FAO, 2007). Other drivers of mangrove forest destruction include activities that divert their sources of freshwater, such as groundwater withdrawals, the building of dams, and the building of roads and drainage canals across tidal flats.\\n\\n3. Mangrove restoration \\nMangroves are sensitive ecosystems, changing dynamically in response to storms, sediment blockage, and fluctuations in sea level (Field, 1998) and present a “moving target” for restoration efforts. Different restoration approaches face this challenge in different ways. The most common method simply consists in planting stands of a single species of mangrove on mudflats, or other areas thought to be suitable, without consideration of whether or not they supported mangroves in the past. This approach usually fails over the long term because the underlying soil and hydrological requirements of the mangroves are not being met. More informed methods aim to bring a damaged mangrove area back into its preexisting condition, taking into account not only ecosystem factors but also social, cultural and political perspectives (Field, 1998). These approaches begin with the understanding that a damaged mangrove area may be able to repair itself through the natural processes of secondary succession, without being physically planted, provided that its tidal and freshwater hydrology is functioning normally and there is an adequate supply of seedlings (Lewis, 2005, 2009a, 2009b). Taking this into account, it becomes crucial to the success of a restoration project to evaluate what the hydrology of a disturbed mangrove site should look like under normal conditions, and the ways in which it has been modified.\\n\\nAn exemplar of this approach is the Ecological Mangrove Restoration method (Lewis, 2005, 2009a, 2009b) which recommends the following steps, to be undertaken using healthy mangroves of the surrounding area as a reference: 1) assess the ecology, especially reproduction and distribution patterns, of the mangrove species at the disturbed site; 2) map the topographical elevations and hydrological patterns that determine how seedlings should establish themselves at the site; 3) assess the changes made to the site that currently prevent the site from recovering by itself; 4) design a restoration plan that begins by restoring the normal range of elevations and tidal hydrology at the site; and 5) monitor the site to determine if the restoration has been successful in light of the original objectives. The actual planting of seedlings is a last resort, since it fails in many cases (Lewis, 2005); it should be considered only if natural recruitment of seedlings fails to reach the restoration objective. \\n\\n4. Additional considerations\\nAn important but often overlooked aspect of mangrove restoration efforts is the role that the local communities play as stakeholders in the process and the outcome. Since they may directly feel the effects of restoration projects, they should be involved in the process as much as feasibly possible, from decision-making to maintenance over the long term. Their involvement and local knowledge, as well as collaboration with other stakeholders such as sponsors and governing agencies, is crucial to the success of restoration projects.\\n\\n5. Limitations\\nIn some areas, restoration may be prohibitively difficult due to the degradation of the soil that regularly follows the clear-cutting of mangrove forests. Common effects include advanced erosion of the soil, loss of nutrients, high levels of salinity, and/or buildup of toxins (Field, 1998). However, even without this extent of degradation, the soil may be come unable to host plant life at all due to the loss of the live mangrove roots, which exuded oxygen and carbohydrate into the soil and maintained its quality. \\n\\nUsing foresight early in the restoration process to carefully select sites that are likely to succeed as self-maintaining ecosystems, as well as ensuring that proper management is built into the conservation effort, can prevent the waste of time and energy that often accompanies restoration projects. The long-lasting aftereffects of mangrove degradation underscore the importance of eliminating its causes, since once sites are cleared, they may never completely recover. \\n\\n6.

In recent years many of the world leading ancient wonders preservators have published that the modern environment has a large impact on these historic buildings and sites.\\nOne of the latest discoveries in this field states that ultraviolet radiation(UVR) has a large impact on the material from which these buildings are built.\\nThe material itself may be imune to such things at first, but being exsposed to it for such a long time surely takes it toll, not to mention that time itself slowly degrades all materials on Earth.\\nIn these statments the leading researchers say that UVR seems to influence the bonds between atoms and molecules, and with this making the material(in this case rock) much less durable than usually.\\nSuch cases were found in Egypt(Pyramids), Rome(Coliseum)and almost all other locations where there are hot and dry summers(deserts, mediterainian climate).
=== Understanding Climate Change ===\\n{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n\\nContents\\n\\n    1. Introduction to Climate Change\\n    2. Cause of Climate Change\\n    3. Proof of Climate Change\\n    4. Solutions to Climate Change\\n    5. Overview\\n   \\n\\n\\n1. Governments and scientists alike have agreed that climate change is real and serious. It is a major environmental issue that affects many aspects of today’s society and will affect everyone in the future. Climate change is not a new matter although numerous plans have been implemented recently to accommodate this important issue, particularly in Australia. The continuation of greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere naturally and unnaturally, contributes to the global warming of the planet which causes severe problems which society will have to deal with in generations to come. Not only will we as a society have to look into using cleaner forms of energy, but also sustainable energy that can accommodate the worlds requirements as we expand globally. \\n\\n[[File:Vegetation Induced Circular Snowmelt.jpg|thumb|right|Melted Snow due to the effects of global warming ]]\\n\\n2. There is overwhelming evidence that our climate is changing due to human activities and through natural processes which is unequivocal. One of the main factors that contribute to our climate change in recent years is the increase of greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere, trapping the ultraviolet rays produced by the sun in the earth’s atmosphere and slowly heating the planet. These greenhouse gases are composed of a variety of gases that can absorb and emit infrared radiation such as: carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide and are released mainly through the burning and consumption of fossil fuels. These fossil fuels are what drive the majority of the electrical and motorised power that we use today, from lighting to vehicles to massive industrial power stations and are the main sources of the world’s power. Although, this damaging power comes at a cost, where the environment we live in suffers whilst society continues to use more and more, disregarding the potential threats and problems that are sure to follow with this costly system of living.\\n\\n\\n3. Climate change is the variation in the average pattern of weather over a long period of time. It is generally referred to as ‘global warming’ as all of the earth’s entities are gradually heated by the trapped ultraviolet rays in the atmosphere. This alteration in the weather causes countless problems for the earth’s environment and all living things. The evidence is clear, the increase of global average air, ocean and land temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and the rising of sea levels globally. This causes many detrimental effects for the environments ecosystems and for the animals living in them, for example, the melting of the polar ice caps that are home to polar bears makes it extremely difficult for them to live and thrive as much of their home has been dissolved. Everyone and everything is affected by climate change even on a local level, in Darwin, Australia the rainfall in certain areas has caused major flooding in some low-lying parts, this occurs at high tide when the creeks overflow, although only recently has the flooding occurred due to the rising sea levels. The flooding ruined many houses in the area, blocking roads and caused thousands of dollars’ worth of damages and this is only the beginning. If the greenhouse gases continue to be released into the atmosphere to instigate these chains of events, the disasters in the future will be a lot worse and potentially life-threatening.\\n\\n4. Climate change can be minimised and it is possible to contribute positively to the reduction of greenhouse gases and therefore global warming. Much of the damage afflicted to our planet over the years is irreversible, although there are countless methods and solutions to help save our earth from early catastrophe.  Organizations like ‘Greenpeace’ have numerous ways to protect the environment and work towards sustainable lifestyles that aren’t harmful to the environment.  Some methods that can be incorporated on a large scale is the use of energy-efficient light bulbs which save power by using less current, this has proven to be successful as it reduces the amount of power needed to produce light and therefore less fossil fuels are consumed and less greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. Renewable energy sources such as solar power, wind power and tidal power are also ways to help reduce the emissions produced by using them as alternative energy sources. Other methods that the Australian government have implemented to reduce greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere by large industries is the clean energy bill. The Australian government proposed the clean energy bill in a bid to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and limit global warming by forcing businesses to pay $23 per tonne of CO2 emissions which will pressure large businesses into finding alternative fuel sources that are renewable. Through innovation and creativity, society can find various forms of alternative energy that does not harm our environment and restore it so that the inhabitants of the ecosystems can thrive.\\n\\n5. Global warming also referred to as climate change in the modern society has a large impact on all living things on the planet. The effects of these changes in weather can cause major disruptions in ecosystems potentially destroying habitats of animals and their environment that is irreplaceable. Many solutions are available to help reduce the ever increasing global warming and work towards a cleaner, greener society.
\\n===Earthquake===\\n\\nAn [[earthquake]] is a [[phenomenon]] that results from a sudden release of stored energy that radiates [[seismic wave]]s. At the [[Earth]]'s surface, earthquakes may manifest themselves by a shaking or displacement of the ground and sometimes [[tsunamis]]. Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000-km-long, horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, also known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part bounds the [[Pacific Plate]]. Many earthquakes happen each day, few of which are large enough to cause significant damage.\\n                                                                                                                                                                              \\n  THREE CAUSES OF AN EARTHQUAKES ARE :\\n  There are three main types of fault that may cause an earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip.(1) Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended.(2) Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened.(3) Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other.\\n\\n  THREE EFFECTS OF AN EARTHQUAKE ARE :\\n\\n   (1) This includes damage to buildings and in worst cases the loss of human life.(2)The effects of the rumbling produced by earthquakes usually leads to the destruction of structures such as buildings, bridges, and dams.(3)They can also trigger landslides.
EDUCATION IN COSTA RICA.\\n\\nIn what used to be a poverty-stricken rural backwater, it is understandable that the country's high standards of schooling are a source of enormous national pride. With foregone military budgets funding the massive education system, the only armies these days are hordes of neatly-uniformed schoolchildren on their way to and from school-one of the most ubiquitous images of Costa Rica.\\n\\nEducation is seen as the means to income (salaries are determined by academic level)and status-everyone wants to be cultured. As nearly every job, however menial, requires a high-school education, many adults study at evening classes or through distance learning, choosing from the huge array of courses available.\\n\\nWhile the level of education in Costa Rica is clearly high for the region, and one of the reasons why the country is so popular with foreign business investors in Costa Rica real estate, it seems that a good education is increasingly becoming an issue of wealth.
Viral Influenza Shedding:  It appears that reliable information about viral shedding of Influenza A in general and the current H1N1 "Swine Flu" epidemic is not readily available. In order to rationally recommend quarantine of affected individuals in schools, work sites or other closed communities, it is necessary to know the rate at which affected individuals become less contagious to others. This page is intended to attract commentary from knowledgeable contributors about how rapidly  H1N1 infected individuals can be returned to their communities without unduly risking their colleagues. Although current public health policy recommends isolation from 5 to 10 days after the apparent onset of illness, the scientific basis for this recommendation seems obscure beyond experiments involving artificial viral infection with vaccination strains.
In business, reducing operations to the bare minimum required to continue serving existing business; colloquially, the least necessary to 'keep the lights on'. It emphasizes only those functions needed to continue serving the firm's customers and slows/halts/cancels all other operations (research, development, hiring, promotions and non-salary compensation, capital improvements, etc.)\\n\\nDuring bad economic times, the progression of operations to a lights-on mode typically takes place over several weeks or months of cutbacks, project cancellations and layoffs. \\n\\nThe term also applies to much faster-developing situations, such as a disaster, pandemic or other event that renders large portions of the workforce or infrastructure unable to function. \\n\\nAt larger firms, this mode is part of formal Operational Plan under a variety of names ('Run the Firm', 'Reduced-overhead', etc.)  The Plan is used as a tool to catgeorize projects, assets and infrastructure as part of normal operations. While this is usually to help plan for rapid-onset crises, the same designations eventually apply to a slow-moving economic downturn. \\n\\nSmaller firms usually do not have such formal plans, instead relying on management to designate key people and projects.

The results indicate that trauma is caused by the consequence of young people becoming homeless, and the lives of these men and women should be understood. Other causes for homelessness are issues from people living in poverty, lack of employment, houses being too expensive, gentrification and violence. All of these reasons is why people are now becoming homeless at young ages. \\n\\nYoung children are becoming homeless as well. There are major risks for homeless children, such as poor health care, not having a good well-being and having bad social outcomes. These children are exposed to a very stressful life style, they witness a lot of domestic violence, mental health difficulties and most likely to come from a broken home. In about every 200 children in America, 3 will become homeless today and more then double of that will be at risk for homelessness. School is impacted by homelessness, because of residency requirements, guardianship requirements, delays in transfer of school credits, use of transportation and lack of health resources. Even the children who still attend school that are homeless, have a low attendance record.\\n\\nThere have been alliances that organizations have created to end homelessness. There are studies and estimations that have been made to figure out how many individuals today are homeless. There are strategies that are listed about how to end it and ways to gain more knowledge on the topic as well.
I'm an Astronomy Masters student with a particular interest in terraforming and space colonisation. I wholeheartedly believe that there's an urgent need to solve humanity's problems by making clear advancements in space discovery and colonisation. We need, now more than ever, to start thinking in bigger terms and move on from our earth-bound, earth-centric view. With thousands of years of progress already under our belts, now's the time to step up and take ourselves to the next level. Creative solutions to pressing problems are urgently required! Advancements will only come from more research and hence from greater funding. And that will only come about if there is a groundswell of understanding and support significant enough to shift the political and economic agenda.
Africa Mission Alliance (AMA) is a faith-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Portland, Oregon with subsidiaries in East and Central Africa. The work of AMA began in the country of Rwanda in 2003 as a few individuals dedicated to caring for orphans, widows and the needy in this genocide ravaged country. AMA’s dream is to reach beyond Rwanda into all of Africa and see a new generation of Africans becoming change agents in their vulnerable communities. \\nThe mission of Africa Mission Alliance is to bring professional and general public resources together for the purposes of training, equipping, and supporting local communities in Africa to develop self-sustaining, community-based approaches to solving their problems.\\n\\nAMA believes that the people of Africa do not want to live on handouts. They need help to discover and use their own vision, skills, and resources to achieve self-sufficiency. Africa Mission Alliance is committed to walking and working with communities in Africa by empowering them to build sustainable communities. The larger vision is to address critical needs that hinder development by helping communities receive quality education, skills training, basic health care, access to clean water, and micro-finance loans
contingency plan\\n\\nA contingency plan is a plan devised for an exceptional risk that, though unlikely, would have catastrophic consequences. Contingency plans are often devised by governments or businesses. For example, suppose many employees of a company are traveling together on an aircraft which crashes, killing all aboard. The company could be severely strained or even ruined by such a loss. Accordingly, many companies have procedures to follow in the event of such a disaster. The plan may also include standing policies to mitigate a disaster's potential impact, such as requiring employees to travel separately or limiting the number of employees on any one aircraft.\\n\\nDuring times of crisis, contingency plans are often developed to explore and prepare for any eventualit
Is the Kyoto Protocol heading toward (or does it already contain) provisions for emissions trading or a [[cap and trade]] program?\\n\\nWill nations such as India and China which won't be bound by the protocol, nevertheless participate in a trading program? That is, will they get tens of billions of dollars from the industrialized West (US and Europe) simply for doing nothing?\\n\\nIf global warming is caused by sunspots more than carbon dioxide, and the average atmosphure temperatures levels off at 1.0C to 1.5C higher than the 2000 level, won't the whole thing have amounted to nothing more than an international welfare program for countries with anti-free-market economic policies?\\n\\nI worry about this sort of thing, you know.\\n\\n[[user:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]], Wednesday, June 12, 2002
'''Psoriasis''' is an auto-immune disease with symptoms of red, itchy, scaly, and inflamed. Most suffers typically treat themselves with over-the-counter treatments and prescribed medications. Many negative side effects are attributed to the use of prescribed medications.\\n\\nFor years the herbal treatments for the reduction of psoriasis symptoms have been largely ignored by mainstream physicians. Many health food stores and alternative practitioners are embracing the use of herbs in their stores, practices, and suggestive selling.\\n\\nOne of the trend setters in this arena is a small company out of Tampa, FL., SielosRx. Their use of organic herbs in a cleansing and soothing regimen has caught the eye of local Dermatologist, Dr. Francis Caban. He sees people who have normally received limited results with traditional medications obtain surprising results within weeks of using nothing more than the organic herbs in these products.\\n\\nDr. Caban insists the results are genuine and has offered SielosRx to his clients when they are considering treatment options. He is firm in his belief that psoriasis suffers can choose how they reduce the symptoms of their disease. They no longer have to just suffer or take the medications that have potentially harmful side effects.
<blockquote>\\nThe Earth Sciences (also known as geoscience, the geosciences or Earth Science) is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth. It is a special type of planetary science; it studies the planet we live on: the structure and composition of the Earth, its origins, physical features, changing aspects, and all of its natural phenomena. The major disciplines of The Earth Sciences use physics, mathematics and, chemistry to build a quantitative understanding of the principal areas or spheres of the Earth system. Like in many sciences, The Earth can be studied both experimentally and theoretically. Also, there are both reductionist and holistic approaches to Earth Science.

\\n'''Reasons For Unemployment in Kerala'''\\n\\nIt is interesting to know that the State with the highest literacy rate — almost 97 per cent — has the highest unemployment rate when compared to others. Kerala is known for large-scale migration of skilled labour to other States and countries. \\n\\nA few millions of people of the State have been working outside it for many years. Had they remained in Kerala, the unemployment rate would have been much higher than what was quoted in the article. \\n\\nWhat ails the State that has such a high literacy rate and is also blessed by vast natural resources? \\n\\nDoes the education system make people lethargic or rights-conscious or inefficient or unenterprising to start productive activities for their own progress? Does the education system make people more destructive in nature? \\n\\nNo industrialist wants to set up any industry in Kerala due to labour problems. The State is bankrupt, besides being corrupt and largely politicised. Trade unionism is still alive in Kerala. West Bengal was industrially ruined by the same attitude of the workers despite a highly skilled labour force. \\n\\nInstead of migrating to other States for jobs, Keralites should use their knowledge and expertise in establishing new productive activity on their own. Many of them should look at self-employment for overcoming the serious problem of unemployment.
'''PRANAV'''\\nThe Changing Nature Of Festivals – Fun Or Rituals? \\nPeople from different religions and regions all over India celebrate a number of festivals – religious, cultural and social. The celebrations of such festivals help people come together, shed their egos and the consciousness of individual identities and results in integration. Man is a social animal. He has formed a society and has maintained his own culture. Culture clubs together religion, territorial necessities and requirements of nature and civilisation. The essence of culture can be seen in many festivals. Festivals celebrated all over India follow different regional traditions. Common festivals celebrated in India are Raksha-Bandhan, Navratri, Rangpanchami, Ganesh Utsav etc.In recent years there has been some criticism about the supposedly excessive use of firecrackers, especially during the Hindu festival of Deepavali. The most commonly cited reason is the noise pollution caused by firecrackers.The noise from firecrackers has a more deleterious effect on animals who have a more sensitive sense of hearing than humans. Pets such as dogs and cats, as well as stray cattle in and around cities are most affected. Voluntary and non-profit organizations such as People for Animals educate the public about these issues.Another criticism is that smog caused by firecrackers may be harmful to inhale and can cause difficulty for drivers because of reduced visibility. The usage of "rockets" near apartment buildings has also given rise to many injuries. No law prohibiting this has been passed.
12forests, was founded in Chicago, IL, in 2008. The focus of the organization is  to help the world end exploitation and its causes. It uses proven vedic and yogic methodologies, to distribute karma free vegetarian food, educate and develop sustainable villages. Its outlook is always wide, focusing on how the world views the environment and all living beings.  Understanding the importance of clean and safe environment it introduces everyone to proven strategies of simple development based on cows and land.  12forests which comes from an extensive research background on the importance of cows, as seen in ayurveda and yoga.  The dung and urine of the cow provides for an antiseptic environment which would help third world countries counteract the threats of unsanitary conditions.  Also, it helps to set aside petroleum based and human feces fertilizers as used in the USA and Mexico.  These fertilizers have caused countless deaths in the form of e.coli and cancers, and not to speak of destroying water supplies.  So based on the highest scientific models 12forests is helping poverty stricken children, families and the environment from forced degradation.\\n<ref>12forests.org</ref>
	Abortion has become one of the most divisive issues in American society today, and differing opinions often lead to heated discussions, political division, and even violence.Ever since the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v Wade, this controversial issue has split the nation. Some people agree with Roe and support abortion, others are against it. It is obviously a problem that needs to be solved, and quickly.\\n        The battle over abortion has been going on for a very long time, but really came to public view after the supreme court decision in Roe v Wade.  In this case, a woman whom the court discretely called "Jane Roe" sued in order for women to be able to legally have abortions, even if not in a life threatening situation. The court ruled in her favor, but since then there have been multiple attempts to overturn their decision.
In Alaska, the significant variation in both climate and population make standard architectural applications impractical. The summer months in Alaska draw in more than half of the yearly income for the state due to the increase in construction, commercial fishing, logging and mining, and the tourism industry.  In some regions, including southeastern Alaska, the population fluctuates as much as two thirds from January to July.  This irregularity creates a huge strain on the city especially in the realm of housing.  The majority of the seasonal population is currently expected to live in modular housing units fabricated to withstand less than three years, demanding an unbelievable amount of government funds that could be used elsewhere for city development.  Not only is this economically and environmentally unsound, but it provides only the bare necessities for this population.  This is why a seasonal housing facility is pivotal to the success of the state as a whole and specifically to those cities with a large seasonal population.  The large variation in population between the summer and winter months has created a need for housing types that can “hibernate” seasonally to reduce the amount of necessary energy and maintenance. Not only would this produce a more suitable and environmentally conscious method of housing the seasonal population, but also increase the possibility of permanent residence through an increase in the quality of life.  Although the application of seasonal buildings would be beneficial to most cities in the state of Alaska because of the migration patterns of the seasonal populations, the city of Juneau is particularly affected.  This city, the state’s capital, looses almost one third of its population in this seasonal shift, and yet has maintained a significant role in the economic success of the state.   However, Juneau suffers from housing shortages, urban sprawl and unfavorable living conditions.  This is why the application of a fluctuating, multifamily housing facility would accommodate the seasonal population, densify the current population, and employ environmentally responsive technology to help reduce the overall cost of living.  The success of the proposed building type would change the face of Alaskan housing and address the housing crisis that has for so long gone unaddressed. \\n  The underdevelopment of Alaska is often attributed to the unusual conditions of its latitude including dramatic variation in sunlight hours and harsh weather conditions.  However, this argument is undermined when compared to other cities at the same 60oN Latitude.  Glasgow, Scotland, St. Petersburg, Russia, and Stockholm, Sweden are all located within 5 degrees of the latitude of Juneau Alaska, and all are very established ranging in population from .5-5 million.  In addition, these cities are all major contributor to the overall GDP of their respective countries. The city layouts demonstrate the success of the area with the densely build scheme.  The feature of these cities that is not shared by Juneau is the topography.  All of these cities have a very flat landscape making development much less difficult and also ease in the circulation through and into the region.  It can then be concluded that in Alaska the topographical challenge is more detrimental to the development of the state than the cold climate. \\nThe land area of Alaska is 656425 square miles making it account for almost 20% of the total land area of the United States.  It is by far the largest state at more than 60% the size of Texas, 75% the size of California, and 93% larger than Pennsylvania, and yet is one of the most underdeveloped and underutilized areas in the nation.   The land features significant natural resources and the largest amount of coast line out of any other state in the United States.  \\n\\nThe average population of the United States falls just above 304 million.  The average population per state is just above 6 million, and yet the largest state, that which encompasses almost 1/5 of the United States territory has only 626, 932 inhabitants, almost half of the population of Rhode Island.  These numbers are even more significant when one compares the population density of various states.  Alaska with its vast lands and miniscule population is by far the least dense, having an average of only 1.2 residents per square mile. \\nThe states chosen for comparison have a wide variety of geographic and climatic aspects which shows the diversity of population density over the nation, but none even comes close to the discrepancy between these numbers and those exhibited in the region of Alaska.  It is also strange that Alaska’s proximity to the Pacific Northwest, the religion currently experiencing the largest national population growth, has not more directly affected the influx into this adjacent territory.\\n	The economic trends in the United States have a very significant impact on the economy of Alaska.  The trend over the last 30 years has consistently demonstrated this relationship.  During times of economic turmoil in the US, namely recessions, the migration to Alaska increases drastically.  This is largely due to the more stable job market in Alaska, one that operates more independently from other states in the nation.  The lower chart shows the average state GDP vs. various state’s GDP.   The GDP of Alaska is above the US average.  This should result in a higher population due to a more stable economy, as is the trend in the United States, yet the result is inconsistent in Alaska. \\nThe city of Juneau offers a variety of locations that would benefit from the establishment of a large scale housing facility.  This is largely due to the fact that housing development is currently sprawling into the outskirts of the city lines because of cheap and more buildable land.  This has expanded the city limits, but not the density or even overall population.  In addition to sprawl, in the last 30 years the center of Juneau has shifted from the historic downtown area to the land surround the airport.  Unfortunately this diversion has left the downtown in disrepair.  The migration has occurred because the land surround the downtown area is more difficult to build upon, making construction of single family homes more expensive, and because of the significance of the Juneau Airport as a primary gateway into the state of Alaska.  The city is essentially being split in half socially and industrially.  Reorganizing the city development of the city to focus on the historical downtown area would help preserve the city as a destination and not merely a transit hub.  Locating a housing facility in this area would help facilitate this effort, making it more affordable to establish residence.  It would also reduce the need for public transportation because the majority of employment, especially tourism and government based professions, occurs in this section of the city. \\nThe intended program to be developed on this site is a large scale housing facility.  This facility will cater to a variety of people with different needs throughout the city of Juneau.  The core of the facility will be made up of two and three bedroom units that correspond with the current housing market demand in the area.  In addition to these standard units, a portion of the development will be dedicated to affordable housing units to accommodate the portion of the population that is below the poverty line, including a large portion of the native population in and around Juneau.  In addition, a portion of the units will be seasonally adjustable creating a facility that can fluctuate either physically or systematically to accommodate the seasonal population influx.   This portion of the structure will not merely be cut off from the establishment when not in use, but like the city, will change in use to enhance the facility for the permanent residents.  The establishment of a stable and changing population could be a mutually advantageous relationship. The permanent residents help reduce the maintenance and upkeep to the temporary facilities during the off season and in turn receive a portion of the profit from the seasonal residents.  This relationship would change the dynamic between the two groups are result in a more community centered organization.  In addition to housing units, the facility will include amenities that not only increase its desirability for both temporary and permanent residents, but also work to draw in the surrounding community and population of downtown Juneau.  These amenities will be defined and located in a way to ensure security for the residents while still increasing public circulation to and through the building.  The facility will also be developed in a way that is environmentally sensitive in design and perception.  It will capitalize on the aesthetically unique features of the context and utilize the favorable site conditions to become more self sustaining.  The development of a successful housing system will increase the density in downtown Juneau and provide the citizens with a more habitable and experientially significant living experience.\\n<ref>http://ruralhealth.hrsa.gov/pub/seasonalpopulation.asp#Case1.

What are Prayer Wheels?\\n\\n   Prayer wheels contain the words of the Buddha: teachings of wisdom and compassion. While the Buddha's discourses fill many volumes, they may also be condensed into syllables with deep symbolic meaning known as mantra. Tibetans recite these profound and inspiring texts to instill them in memory and promote the well­being of others. \\n\\n   The Tibetan term "dharma wheel" has been rendered into English as "prayer wheel". Yet prayer wheels are much more than supplicants to a higher spirit. They can contain the full potency and meaning of the path to enlightenment.\\n\\n   Believing that turning dharma wheels filled with these texts and symbols is equivalent to reciting them, Tibetans place dharma wheels in monasteries, temples, and libraries and turn them at every opportunity to convey the blessings of compassion and harmony, prevent natural disasters, and promote peace in the world. Although dharma wheels were known in ancient India and Nepal, only in Tibet did they become an integral part of daily life. Today as in ages past, the dharma wheels are honored as symbols of enlightened knowledge, able to evoke the healing powers of the mind and increase its capacities for wisdom.\\n\\n   In recent years, the world has seen how quickly knowledge-even when valued and protected by an entire culture-can be brought to the brink of extinction. In response, we have made great efforts to preserve the cultural heritage of Tibet, including the intricate science of dharma wheels, which are in themselves ways of preserving and disseminating the benefits of enlightened knowledge. Having created more than a thousand 4 foot high wheels for our own organization and donated 100,000 of the hand-held wheels to individuals in the Himalayan region, we have come to share the view that dharma wheels have a calming and healing influence on the environment and human beings, qualities greatly needed in our world today.
Timber framed boat docks are toxic playgrounds.  In 2001, the EPA banned \\narsenic treated wood from our children’s playgrounds because of the deadly \\nhazards of exposure.  Yet, treated timbers are still being used to build boat \\ndocks in many areas throughout the country.  These timbers continuer to leach \\ndeadly toxins year after year.\\n\\nPressure-treated boards and timbers are leaking poisonous arsenic into our \\nsoil and waterways.  The arsenic comes from 'chromated copper arsenate', CCA, \\nan infusion of pesticides, fungicides, and preservatives to delay the natural \\ndecaying process of wood.  These known carcinogens, have been linked to many \\ncancers, poisonings, severe skin rashes, and many other health issues.\\n\\nCCA treated wood, a very common boat dock building material, exposes us to \\nunnecessary danger when we are most vulnerable.  Barely clothed, barefoot, and \\nwet the very waters around these docks continually wash the treated surfaces \\nwhere we play.  All reports and handling guidelines suggest we were gloves, \\nglasses, and long sleeve shirts when handling CCA treated wood.  Yet, once in \\nplace as our waterfront play ground, we can't expect our children to go \\nswimming with so much protection.\\n\\nMore than 30 million pounds of pure arsenic comes  into the U.S. each year. \\nMuch of this is used in treating wood and timbers that will be used in dock \\nconstruction.

== Recycing- the need ==\\n\\n<br />The need for recycling has greatened over the past thirty years as the realisation of global warming has spread throughout the governments of the world. As the threat of rising sea levels, unstable weather conditions and ultimately a heating world creeps upon mankind, some people have decided to take action while others take a back seat. Whatever attitude the world has the simple fact is that changes in the climate are happening and recycling and other methods can contribute to limit the effect of global warming.\\n<br />\\n*[[global warming-overview]]\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n== Global warming-overview==\\nGlobal warming is occurring throughout the world because of increased levels of Carbon Dioxide being emmitted has caused (it is widely believed) the o-zone layer to thicken therefore trapping the suns energy inside the earths atmosphere and heating the earth accordingly.
'''Aquati Equini'''\\nThe Planet of Water!\\n&\\nThe Ancient City of Atlantis!\\n<gallery>\\nImage:Example.jpg|Caption1\\n</gallery>\\n\\nThe Earth as we know today is millions of years old and has undergone many transformations and metamorphic changes. Our planet Aquati Equini the "Earth" and its evolution of the ecosystem, with its physical and spiritual beings is the third planet from the Sun, and the largest of the terrestrial planets in the Solar System in terms of diameter, mass and density. It is also referred to as the World, the Blue Planet, and Terra continues to evolve.It is in the physical world (the third dimension of reality or so called duality)we find ourselves in a world of constant change and unstable eventuality.\\n\\nHome to millions of species,including humans, Earth is the only place in the universe where we find life is known to exist today. The planet formed 4.54 billion years ago,and life appeared on its surface within a billion years. Since then, Earth's biosphere has significantly altered the atmosphere and other abiotic conditions on the planet, enabling the proliferation of aerobic organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which, together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks harmful radiation, permitting life on land.The physical properties of the Earth, as well as its geological history and orbit, allowed life to persist during this period. The world is expected to continue supporting life for another 1.5 billion years, after which the rising luminosity of the Sun will eliminate the biosphere.\\n\\n----\\n\\nMR
A scientific phrase used to explain the recent phenomenon of the gradual cooling of the Gulf Stream.  The phrase comes from the noted effect of heat exchange in the blood flow in the reindeer's body.  In order to conserve warmth, the blood flowing ethrough the legs of a reindeer is considerably colder than that of the rest of it's body.  This is achieved by a heat exchange system; see http://library.thinkquest.org/3500/caribou.html for more details.\\nThis effect has been used to describe the recently discovered cooling of the Gulf Stream while the original equatorial currents have remained of the same temperature.  Over the last 20 years the temperature of the Gulf Stream (passing from the coast of South America up through the Atlantic and past the British Isles) has been studied by scientists in Scotland.  A recent report, published by both the Scientific Institute for Climate Research and Greenpeace, states that the temperature of the Gulf Stream near Scotland has dropped by three degrees celsius over twenty years and by two degrees over the last ten years.  This accelerated cooling has been attributed to the melting of the arctic ice shelf but is disputed by many scientists, mostly in America, where the report has been met with some incredulity.  See the Greenpeace website for a full version of the report.
Although the company labels itself as being environmentally friendly, but BP a major cause of pollution, actually ranked within the top ten worst environmentally friendly corporations. The company is a accused of greenwashing. BP changed its name from British Petroleum to BP, standing for "beyond petroleum" and adopted a yellow sunflower similar to that of the Canadian Green Party symbol. They appear to be green but in fact, none of these green symbols properly portray the company. \\n\\nBetween January 1997 and March 1998, the company was responsible for 104 oil spills and has also been charged for burying polluted gases. The company has also been permitted to dump nearly two-thousand pounds of ammonia and almost five thousand pounds into Lake Michigan everyday. BP allowed 270,000 gallons of oil to spread into the Alaskan tundra, and only admitted to doing so after they were confronted by journalists. BP is responsible for fifteen deaths after one of their oil refineries in Texas exploded. It's also been reported that BP is responsible for spilling nearly two thousand gallons of chemicals onto frozen tundra in Alaska. The chemicals that spilled are poisonous to plants and aniamls, and will melt the tundra. \\n\\nBP does not have good environmental standing. The company donataes over five million dollars to political campaigns, possibly an effort of stay in business and be exempt from US laws. They are guilty of killing and harming the planet, not just in the United States but all over the globe. They are listed as one of Scotland's largest polluters.
The U.S. frequently uses its economic power in order to punish other countries.  One of the ways the U.S. does this is by holding back on exporting food.   Reasons for the punishment of another country vary; however, they can be broken down into two main groups: Foreign containment objective and market development/humanitarian objectives.  The foreign containment objective tends to punish those countries who are threatening to the U.S.  An example of such a threat would be countries under other forms of government.   More examples related to the containment objective would be:  no aid to communist countries, no aid to socialist governments, no aid to countries who support radical regimes, no aid to regimes with an inadequate democracy who are too weak to be anti-communist (effectively), no aid to countries who will not accept U.S. agreements.  An example of market development and humanitarian objectives would fall under a category of countries that are trying to compete with the U.S. economically.  The U.S. will execute foreign aid punishments to countries trying to nationalize property of U.S. companies, countries who want to take over functions by U.S. companies, and countries trying to initiate nationalistic economic policies.
Hemostasis is the arrest of bleeding by the physiological properties of vasoconstriction and coagulation; or more simply, blood clotting. \\nFor our Wiki project we would like to take a closer look at the Hemostasis process, how it happens, and what factors in and outside of the body affect it. By understanding how it works on a cellular level we would like to find out how other things in our bodies can affect it, such as vasoconstriction, vasodilation, age, and the heart. We would like to find out what proteins play a major role in the  hemostasis process and if by adding or taking away certain nutrients can greatly affect the hemostatic response. As far as outside influences we want to figure out the negative and positive effects of different drugs, and certain diseases such as Von Willebrand’s disease and Thrombophilia. \\nBy understanding how the process works and what factors change the response, we believe we can provide an adequate response and a description of how hemostasis works in correlation with the rest of the body.
My report on Thoroughbreds so far:\\n\\nThoroughbreds have a well-chiseled head. Thoroughbreds are considered a hot-blooded horse because of their agility, speed, and spirit.\\n\\nThe thoroughbred that is known today was developed in the 17th and the 18th century, which was 1600 and 1700. All modern Thoroughbreds can find their pedigrees to three stallions originally transported into England in the 1600s and 1700s. During the 1800s and the 1700s, the Thoroughbred breed went around the world. Many thoroughbreds exist worldwide today ,with over 118,000 people registered each year worldwide.   \\n\\nThoroughbreds are usually used for racing but also bred for other riding disciplines, such as show jumping, combined training, and more. They are also cross-bred with other breeds to create new breeds or improve existing breeds.\\n\\nThoroughbred racehorses perform with maximum effort, which has resulted on high rates of accidents and other health problems. Also, thoroughbreds are prone to other health problems, including bleeding from the lungs, small hearts, and more. There are several theories for the reasons behind the frequency of accidents and health problems in the  thoroughbred breed, and research continues into how to reduce the accident rate and treat those animals that are injured.\\n\\nThoroughbreds are most often bay, seal brown, chestnut, black, or gray. The less common colors that are recognized in the United States are roan, palomino, and more. White is not seen that much, but it is also known color separate from the gray.
\\n\\nDual-coding theory, a theory of cognition, was first advanced by Allan Paivio of the University of Western Ontario in 1971. The theory postulates that both visual and verbal information are processed differently and along distinct channels with the human mind creating separate representations for information processed in each channel. Both visual and verbal codes for representing information are used to organize incoming information into knowledge that can be acted upon, stored, and retrieved for subsequent use.\\nEach channel also has limitations. For example, humans have difficulty simultaneously attending to multiple auditory or visual cues, depending on expertise with the task or prior knowledge with the subject area. For example, a television documentary that shows images of plant and animal life in a rain forest while also simultaneously providing narration that describes the animal life could potentially provide for improved learning using the dual-code theory because the visual and verbal information does not compete with each other.\\nA multimedia presentation that shows multiple visuals such as an image of a speaker as well as the text that the speaker is reading, such as a series of bullet points, could overwhelm the viewer, depending on the person and the situation, because the viewer must now attend to two images.
'''Groundwork'''\\n\\nEstablished in 1981, Groundwork is a voluntary environmental organisation, dedicated to the preservation of some of Ireland's most precious habitats: the oak woodlands in Killarney National Park, Co. Kerry.\\n\\nMost of Groundwork’s focus has been on the removal of the invasive Rhododendron ponticum from Killarney National Park.\\n\\nThe unique ecology of the Killarney oak woodlands is seriously threatened by the invasion of Rhododendron ponticum. This non-native shrub thrives in the mild and moist conditions in Killarney and can spread rapidly especially where soils are acidic. Within 25 years rhododendron can form impenetrable thickets with plants up to six metres in height. These thickets cast such a dense shade that almost nothing can grow beneath them. This prevents the regeneration of the oakwoods.\\n\\nDuring the last 27 years Groundwork has changed from a small group of environmentally-concerned Irish students to an organisation attracting conservation-minded people from all over the world to carry out voluntary work in one of Ireland's most beautiful natural landscapes.\\n\\nSee http://www.groundwork.ie
== is the world on the end ==\\n\\nThe 2012 phenomenon comprises a range of eschatological beliefs according to which cataclysmic or transformative events will occur on December 21, 2012.[1][2][3][4] This date is regarded as the end-date of a 5,125-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae have been proposed as pertaining to this date, though none have been accepted by mainstream scholarship.\\nA New Age interpretation of this transition is that this date marks the start of time in which Earth and its inhabitants may undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 2012 may mark the beginning of a new era.[5] Others suggest that the 2012 date marks the end of the world or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world include the arrival of the next solar maximum, or Earth's collision with a black hole, passing asteroid or a planet called "Nibiru".\\nScholars from various disciplines have dismissed the idea of such cataclysmic events occurring in 2012. Professional Mayanist scholars state that predictions of impending doom are not found in any of the extant classic Maya accounts, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar "ends" in 2012 misrepresents Maya history and culture.[3][6][7] Astronomers and other scientists have rejected the proposed events as pseudoscience, stating that they are contradicted by simple astronomical observations.[8]
Overview\\nThe United States is the world’s largest producer of beef, according to the USDA. The United States also has the largest fed-cattle industry in the world, primarily high-quality, grain-fed beef used for both domestic and export use.\\n\\nThe U.S. beef industry has undergone massive improvements in overall system efficiency. High-quality beef continues to flow to consumers even as the overall cattle and calf inventory has dropped from 130 million in 1975 to 92.6 million in 2011 (NASS). This is occurring because of significant improvements to genetics, which has virtually doubled the weaning weights since the 1960s and has made it possible to consistently deliver an animal that has gained 1,000 pounds each month since birth. The other efficiency gains have been made through technology, including growth implants with strategies to optimize their use. Also, industry consolidation has led to more comprehensive use of parasite control, mineral supplementation, good feedbunk management, optimization of rebreeding cycles and much more.\\n\\nLike most commodity production, cattle and beef are subjected to a cyclical pattern of production: a series of peaks and valleys in herd size and production that typically lasts from eight to 12 years. This cycle of production is counter-cyclical to the price. These cycles fall heaviest on the cow/calf sector, which has no real margin recourse or an ability to manage supply effectively. In beef production, large amounts of grain are fed to the animals, so the cattle cycle is affected by the price and supplies of grain as well. Today, we see the effects of foreign trade and the politics of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or more commonly, mad cow disease) dramatically influencing price. While exports generally amount to 7 percent of total beef sales, the effect on price can be dramatic and has been a significant drag on what should be a higher market at this time.\\n\\nThe cattle industry plays an integral role in the country’s economic growth and well being. More than one million cattlemen and women do business in a free-market economy and represent the largest single segment of American agriculture.\\n\\nThe 2007 U.S. Census of Agriculture found that the largest single segment of the U.S. agricultural economy is beef production, with cattle and calves representing about 21 percent of total farm sales.\\n\\nAccording to the American Farm Bureau Federation, agriculture is responsible for approximately 21 million jobs—everything from growing the food to selling it in the supermarket. Beef production itself is a major employer, with more than 186,000 full-time jobs on farms and ranches creating more than 1 million more jobs throughout the economy.\\n\\nDemand\\nBeef consumption in the United States averaged 61.2 pounds per person in 2008, down from 65 pounds in 2000 (ERS 2008). According to USDA, U.S. consumers continue to purchase more meat with a smaller proportion of disposable income, continuing the long-term trend. ERS predicts that over the next 10 years, meat purchases will decline from about 2 percent to 1.3 percent of disposable income. As of 2007, meat purchases accounted for 1.7 percent of disposable personal income and 30 percent of total food expenditures.\\n\\nA USDA study concluded that almost 65 percent of all beef was purchased at retail stores for at-home consumption. Ground beef ranked first for at-home consumption followed by steaks. On average, consumers purchased 43 pounds of beef from retail stores. Ground beef consumed at restaurants accounted for 60 percent of the beef eaten away from home. Consumers purchased more than 23 pounds of beef away from home a year.\\n\\nProduction\\nOn January 1, 2011, the inventory of U.S. beef cows was 30.9 million head, down 2 percent from January 1, 2010. Beef replacement heifers totaled 5.2 million head, down 5 percent. Cattle and calves on feed for slaughter in all feedlots totaled 14 million, up 3 percent.  (NASS 2011)\\n\\nNearly 70 percent of U.S. cattle are produced in the central region of the country, extending from North Dakota to Texas and from South Dakota to Tennessee. According to the 2007 Census of Agriculture, there were 687,540 beef cattle operations in the United States. Texas hosts the largest number of beef operations (131,769), followed by Missouri (51,289), Oklahoma (47,059) and Tennessee (42,344).\\n\\nNebraska, Iowa and Kansas host the largest number of feedlots, but Texas, Kansas, Nebraska and Colorado market the most cattle annually, that is, 5.7 million head, 5.1 million head, 4.8 million head and 1.9 million head, respectively.\\n\\nIn their U.S. Baseline Briefing Book, University of Missouri experts noted that beef demand should strengthen as the U.S. economy recovers.   \\n \\nProcessing\\nBeef production totaled 26.4 billion pounds in 2010, up 1 percent from the previous year. Commercial cattle slaughter during 2010 totaled 34.2 million head, up 3 percent from 2009. The average live weight was 1,279 pounds, down 14 pounds from a year ago. Steers comprised 49.2 percent of the total federally inspected cattle slaughter, heifers 29.8 percent, other cows 10.8 percent, dairy cows 8.3 percent and bulls 1.8 percent. \\n\\nIn their Meat and Poultry Facts 2008, AMI experts speculated that beef slaughter rates will stall, triggering a reconfiguration of the beef packing industry. A South American firm, JBS, purchased two U.S. beef packers in 2008: Swift & Company and Smithfield Beef Group. Barring further consolidation, JBS is likely to dominate the industry in the coming years.\\n\\nAccording to NASS, 632 of the 841 plants operating under federal inspection slaughtered cattle. The 14 largest plants slaughtered 55 percent of the total cattle killed in 2010. In 2006, the four largest plants slaughtered nearly 70 percent of all cattle commercially slaughtered.\\n\\nTop Ten Beef Packers\\nCompany Name and Location 	Daily Capacity\\n\\nTyson Foods, Arkansas\\n	27,375\\nJBS Swift1, Colorado 	26,050\\nCargill Meat Solutions, Kansas 	25,850\\nNational Beef Packing Co., Missouri 	13,100\\nAmerican Foods Group, Minnesota 	5,575\\nNebraska Beef, Nebraska 	3,000\\nGreater Omaha Packing, Nebraska 	2,650\\nXL Beef 	2,200\\n\\nCaviness\\n	1,700\\nCreekstone, Kansas 	1,600\\n1JBS acquired Smithfield Beef Group in October 2008.\\nSource: Meat and Poultry Facts, AMI, January 2010.\\n\\nExports\\nOverall, the U.S. beef industry exported 726,229 metric tons (MT) of beef and veal valued at $3.4 billion. Top buyers, accounting for more than half of the U.S. beef exports, were Mexico, Canada, Japan and South Korea. In 2010, Brazil and Australia exported more beef than the United States. However, these countries primarily graze their cattle on pasture rather than feed them grain.  \\n \\nFactors allowing for the upward momentum in the U.S. beef export market, according to USDA, include the weak dollar and strong economic recovery in the rest of the world, coupled with tightened supplies of competing beef. USDA estimated total U.S. beef exports for 2011 at 2.43 billion pounds or 9.3 percent of U.S. production. \\n\\nImports\\nThe United States remains a net importer of beef. According to FAS, the United States imported 768,558 MT of beef and veal valued at $2.8 billion. Canada continued to rank as the largest supplier of fresh/chilled beef into the United States in 2010, closely followed by Australia.\\n\\nCompetitive Analysis\\nIn terms of red meat expenditures in 2007, Americans spent $270.42 per person on beef (AMI). According to the USDA, U.S. consumers spent $159.37 per person on poultry that year.\\n\\nBeef has traditionally competed with the pork industry for per capita meat consumption with United States and global consumers. However, the poultry industry has increased in per capita meat consumption and the amount of disposable income spent on meat at a greater rate than beef or pork. This trend is attributed in part to the rapid development of convenient poultry products. As more and more consumers work outside the home, convenience and ease of preparation become an issue for the meat industry. Price is also a consideration. \\n\\nValue-added Opportunities\\nBecause the cyclical nature of the beef industry leads to over-supplies and depressed prices, many producers look for alternatives to market their cattle versus the traditional live commodity markets.\\n\\nOrganic Beef\\nDuring the 1990s, organic farming became one of the fastest growing segments of U.S. agriculture. The United States had 43,782 beef cattle certified organic in 2008, up from 20,285 beef cows in 2003. USDA organic standards were implemented in 2002. The United States had 1.85 million acres of pasture and rangeland certified organic in 2008. \\n\\nWhy the large increase in organic beef? Many producers feel it is a good way to lower input costs, decrease reliance on nonrenewable resources, capture high-value markets with premium prices and boost farm income. Organic beef production is based on a system of farming that maintains and replenishes soil fertility without the use of pesticides and fertilizers. Organic beef is minimally processed without artificial ingredients, preservatives or irradiation. For more information on organic beef, please see the Organic Beef section of the Web site.\\n \\nNatural Beef\\nNatural does not have the same strict interpretation as organic does. According to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, all fresh meat qualifies as “natural,” but those labeled “natural” cannot contain any artificial flavor or flavoring, coloring ingredient, chemical preservatives or any other artificial or synthetic ingredient; and the product and its ingredients are not more than minimally processed (ground, for example). Some companies promote their beef as natural because the cattle were not exposed to antibiotics or hormones and were totally raised on a range instead of being “finished” in a feedlot.\\n\\nResearch conducted at Kansas State University has shown that consumers tended to associate natural beef with local, family farms and perceived an increased value from that aspect. Research shows that some suburban, higher income consumers in some regions are willing to pay more for natural beef cuts from the loin. This is a growing market but still a small percentage of total U.S. meat sales.\\n \\nFor more information on natural beef, please see the Natural Beef section of the Web site.\\n \\nBranded/Certified/Verified\\nTraceability, tracking the product from its origin through processing, is becoming a competitive advantage to today’s meat suppliers. Product quality attributes or the actual manufacturing process is verified or certified by a third party.\\n\\nSuch programs may become increasingly important as the food industry makes further attempts to appeal to the social consciousness of consumers. According to USDA, the top three U.S. restaurant franchises place restrictions on how animals used in the companies’ foods are produced, accounting for approximately 35 percent of franchised restaurant sales.\\n\\nFor more information, please visit the Branded/Certified/Verified section of the Web site.\\n \\nDirect Market Beef\\nDirect marketing is selling food and farm products directly to consumers without using an intermediary. This may include direct sales to grocery stores, restaurants, door-to-door and freezer sales and Internet marketing.\\n\\nDirect marketing of livestock products is not as common as other vegetables and melons, for example, because livestock require further processing. The percentage of farms with direct sales was higher in more urbanized counties.\\n\\nHowever, direct marketing can provide prices for producers higher than typical wholesale prices, yet below supermarket prices. Interest in food safety, the environment and alternative agriculture has also supported this growth. Consumers enjoy dealing face-to-face with the producers of the products they are purchasing.\\n\\n\\n"Pastured, or free range, poultry" refers to a poultry production system that is characterized by chickens, turkeys or ducks being raised primarily on pasture. The birds supplement their grain feed by foraging for up to 20 percent of their intake and are often moved regularly to fresh pasture.\\n\\nPastured poultry is a niche market that taps into increased consumer demand for more natural and humanely raised protein sources. Consumers demanding this type of poultry product are generally willing to pay more for the system, which includes raising poultry on grassy pasture to deliver a product that is considered by many consumers to be healthier and tastier, as well as more environmentally sound. Pastured poultry production generally has lower entry costs and thus is attractive to smaller or limited resource farmers.\\n\\nMarketing\\nPastured poultry also taps into the growing natural foods market. Like the natural foods market, the certified organic food market is quite similar in terms of consumer demands and characteristics. The Food Marketing Institute found that 59 percent of consumers look for and purchase products labeled as natural, and 37 percent look for and purchase products labeled as organic. Nutrition Business Journal estimated “natural” and organic food and beverage sales reached $28.2 billion in 2006, a 14.1 percent increase from 2005. However, the same publication found that organic meat sales were 24 percent of the total. While not all pastured poultry is certified organic, comparing the markets can be helpful in determining overall general tendencies in consumer demand.\\n\\nFoods with a "natural" label had $22.3 billion in sales in 2008, according to "Healthy Eating Report for 2008" from the Nielsen Company, New York. The organic food industry, meanwhile, grew to more than $28.6 million in 2010, according to the Organic Trade Association.\\n\\nFarmers' markets are being used as an important marketing outlet for many smaller direct marketing poultry producers. Producers often receive their highest prices at these markets, followed by restaurants. Retail and other sales return the lowest prices.\\n\\nSmall-scale producers sold nearly 50 percent of their chickens directly from their farm. Large-scale producers, defined as producers raising more than 4,000 chickens a year, sold a greater proportion of their chickens to restaurants and retail outlets. \\n\\nThis growth trend in farmers' markets supports the growing consumer demand for direct-marketed, small-scale production techniques such as free range or pastured poultry. For instance, farmers' market consumers are requesting more information about how products were grown and if they were grown organically. According to a 2004 Economic Research Service (ERS) publication, when 210 farmers' market managers were polled, customers with a strong demand for organic products were also interested in environmental and social issues within agriculture, including sustainable development, environmental pollution and wildlife protection. These factors support expanded marketing opportunities for small-scale poultry production such as pastured and free range.\\n\\nPastured meat products and the growth of that market can also be attributed to the fact that a growing number of consumers support smaller farmers, are opposed to livestock raised in confinement and have a set of values that prefer animal products resulting from a pastured system.\\n\\nIn its "America’s Changing Appetite: Food Consumption and Spending to 2020" report, the Economic Research Service (ERS 2002) concluded that U.S. consumers would be demanding more quality due to increased population and an increase in educational attainment and wealth. Quality purchases look at differentiated products and include foods marketed with specific production techniques such as pastured poultry, for instance. Consumers are demanding higher quality, healthy foods, and they are increasingly demanding to know that their food is safe. They also want assurances from agricultural producers, retailers and foodservice workers about how the food was grown and what production techniques were used.\\n\\nAccording to the same ERS study, total poultry purchases are expected to have market growth of 19 percent for at-home meals and 18 percent for away-from-home meals. If specific qualities such as environmental concerns and animal welfare continue to gain consumer support, these types of production systems will provide a growing market for pastured poultry producers.\\n\\nDemand\\nAccording to the National Chicken Council, U.S. consumption of chicken steadily increased from 2000 until peaking at 87.7 pounds per person in 2006. Chicken consumption was 83.8 pounds per person in 2009. Chicken has passed beef and is currently the most consumed meat.\\n\\nProduction\\nThe many management alternatives available to poultry producers are as follows:\\n\\n    * Portable houses\\n    * Pasture pens\\n    * Integrated systems\\n\\nThousands of small farms in the United States and worldwide produce what is called "pastured poultry." To these farmers, pastured poultry means chickens and other poultry raised right on top of living grasses. As long as they get all the grass they want, poultry can qualify to be called grass fed. This is accomplished by keeping the birds in low, wide, bottomless cages called "chicken tractors" that are moved to a new spot of fresh pasture once or more often each day.\\n\\nThe term grass-fed poultry is a larger group, of which the pastured birds are a sub-set. Among producers, grass-fed poultry means birds that are allowed to forage on as much living grasses as they desire, whether in chicken tractors, small coops surrounded by pasture, or the exclusive French "Label Rouge," or Red Label, birds.\\n\\nThe Label Rouge System\\nFor people seeking ways to increase the profit potential of free range poultry systems as a full-time enterprise, the new “Label Rouge” approach may hold promise. Popular in France since the mid-1960s, the “red label” system produces free range poultry on a larger scale and takes advantage of direct marketing opportunities. In France, Label Rouge chickens have captured 33 percent of the poultry market. Label Rouge enterprises offer independence, use lower densities of birds per housing unit, allow flock access to pasture, discourage routine medication and feature longer life spans–12 weeks–for broilers and other meat birds to reach market weight. The longer life of the birds has become a chief marketing point, along with a flavor Label Rouge proponents claim is superior. Because the Label Rouge bird is not a typical American Cornish Cross breed, because it lives longer and because, after processing, it is cooled through air chilling, people consistently notice a taste difference. Air chilling discourages cross-contamination because carcasses are hung and chilled separately rather than lying in contact in a water bath, and flavor is not compromised by chlorine, typically added to chill water in poultry processing plants to kill bacteria and other microbes.\\n\\nWhile a farmer may not be able to produce as many of these flocks per season, charging considerably more for each bird boosts profits. For more information on Label Rouge, go to http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/labelrouge.html.\\n \\nPastured poultry generally commands higher prices; therefore, the potential for profit is higher than with conventional, confinement poultry. Under this system, poultry is usually sold locally, with only minimal processing. Broilers sell for between $1.50 and $2.50 per pound, dressed weight. Turkeys sell between $1.75 and $2.50 per pound. Prices vary among producers. The price difference often depends on whether the birds are sold from the chill tank, or are bagged, weighed, labeled and ready for the freezer. Production costs are usually about 1/2 to 2/3 the sale price. Many producers do not add their labor into production costs. It is the most commonly used pasture poultry method at present.\\n \\nFree range has been practiced for a century or more. This system fell out of favor in the 1960s due to disease and predator inroads, and was mostly replaced by commercial confinement poultry production. Free Range generally means a fenced pasture surrounding the barn or poultry shelter.\\n\\nIntegrated systems focus on services that poultry can provide, such as fertilization, tillage and insect and weed control rather than only meat production. Various species of domestic animals are raised together to complement each other. Disease cycles can be broken when the same species does not occupy the same site all of the time.\\n\\nChickens need protection and shade outdoors, such as trees and bush plantings. In fact, they may not venture outdoors without it. United Kingdom studies of free range poultry suggest that the amount of sun and the time of day have the greatest impact on chicken behavior. Chickens were most active during partial sun and during the morning and late afternoon.\\n\\nChickens obtain limited nutrients from forage plants, although eggs from hens raised on legumes and grass have more omega 3 fatty acids and vitamins than eggs from hens raised only on grass. Worms and insects provide high-quality nutrients, but research suggests that modern broilers need adequate nutrients and feed supplementation.\\n\\nOne limitation of pastured poultry: in cooler climates, the birds can only be raised during the summer and early fall months. Another limitation, especially for large-scale pastured poultry operations, is labor requirements. Many tasks, such as watering and feeding, must be done by hand.  \\n\\nOften, pastured poultry is one enterprise of many for producers.\\n\\nProcessing\\nOne major concern for many producers is processing--both the availability of licensed processors and the quality of the processing. To sell across state lines, producers must have their poultry butchered at a federally inspected plant. To sell within their state, producers need only have their poultry butchered at a state-inspected plant. A thorough understanding of the appropriate state and federal laws regarding poultry processing and sales is vital for each pastured poultry producer.\\n\\nAdditionally, with global concerns over avian influenza and other livestock diseases, pastured poultry producers should be familiar with poultry diseases, their symptoms and any relevant reporting procedures surrounding disease outbreaks.\\n\\nGovernment/Regulatory Involvement\\nThe USDA does not currently have specific regulatory definitions for free range although the term is allowed on labels under certain conditions. When applying for label approval, the producer must submit a brief description of the housing, which the USDA reviews to determine that poultry have access to the outdoors for at least half their lives. In contrast, the European Union defines free range, specifying maximum stocking density, type of feed, minimum slaughter age and amount of space to go outside.\\n\\n\\nU.S. Cattle and Beef Industry,

'''Stem cells'''\\n\\nStem cells come in three diffrent variations Embryonic stem cells, Adult stem cells, and Induced pluripotent stem cells. Diseases that might be treated by transplanting cells generated from human embryonic stem cells include Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, traumatic spinal cord injury, Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, Heart disease, and vison and hearing loss.\\n\\npluripotent stem cells offer a possibility of renewable source of replacement cells and replacement tissues to a bunch of diseases , disabilities and conditions such as Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injury, burns, heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. Some disadvantages of stem cells being used in treatments include: embryonic stem cells can treat diseases and regenerating organs but they are harvested from human fetus’s sometimes the treatment might not work Ex. Somebody needs a bone marrow transplant and this transplant uses adult stem cells but then the treatment might not work because the adult stem cells die.\\n\\nStem cells show potential for many different areas of health and medical research, and studying them can help us understand how they transform into the dazzling array of specialized cells that make us what we are. Some of the most serious medical conditions, such as cancer and birth defects, are caused by problems that occur somewhere in this process. A better understanding of normal cell development will allow us to understand and perhaps correct the errors that cause these medical conditions.One kind of stem cell—human embryonic stem cells—has generated much interest and public debate. Pluripotent stem cells (cells that can develop into many different cell types of the body) are isolated from human embryos that are a few days old. Pluripotent stem cell lines have also been developed from fetal tissue (older than 8 weeks of development).
'''Default Nullification'''\\n\\nDefined.\\n\\n[[Default Nullification]] is a state constitutional amendment or legislation that automatically nullifies all federal laws and regulations until said state's legislature can take up the issue to adopt, approve, and fund, or not.  If adoption is not achieved, non-compliance (and non-funding) is the circumstance.\\n\\nDefault Nullification is a political trend developing in states across the nation in response to the rampant spending, corruption, and unresponsiveness found in Washington D.C.  Enactment of this measure would achieve the following:\\n\\n1. It would restore genuine Constitutional governance by requiring state legislatures to cease and desist in abrogating their Constitutional governing responsibilities to D.C.\\n\\n2. It would require all special interests and lobbyists in D.C. to spread out over 50 different geographical locations across the country to petition citizens for favor and taxes. \\n\\n3. It would promote genuine state diversity throughout the nation, thereby optimizing competition between states for the nation's citizens.\\n\\n4. It would have the effect of defunding and reducing governing authority in Washington D.C. \\n\\n5. Would offer the greatest opportunity for a permanent, constitutional "fix" for the Washington problem, as nullification is largely immune to Federal court rulings. States are not required to obtain federal court approval to enact nullification rights according to Article One, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, and also of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.
==Course description==\\n\\nWhy, in the midst of great affluence, are people poor, and in some cases, persistently so?  This question has captured the imagination of social scientists and social critics for over one century.  In this course, we will become intimate with some of the key theoretical, critical, and empirical writings that seek to provide insight into this enduring problem.  In the process, seminar participants will become familiar with the key issues and debates animating discussions of American sociologists: Is there a culture of poverty?  Why does poverty persist in the face of economic growth?  What accounts for the feminization and juvenilization of poverty?  Does government intervention help, or does it just make matters worse?  As seminar participants deepen their knowledge in these areas, they will learn to identify and interrogate key assumptions driving these interventions and the evolution of the field, generally, and hopefully they will begin to offer critical perspectives of their own.
Inboxication is the overwhelming feeling and resulting stress associated with the challenge of keeping up with all the information from our inboxes and the all too common addiction to these inboxes. Studies have shown that constant interruptions caused by the bleeps of our mobile phones and email systems are causing Constant Partial Attention (CPA). The increase in the number of emails recieved daily combined with the multitude of communications channels such as SMS, IM and social networking mediums is increasing the impact of Data Smog and resulting in more Information Fatigue Syndrome. More and more people are exhibiting signs of Attention Deficit Trait(ADT) as they struggle to maintain focus and reduce stress.
\\nTechnology is the making, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The word technology comes from Greek τεχνολογία (technología); from τέχνη (téchnē), meaning "art, skill, craft", and -λογία (-logía), meaning "study of-".[1] The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include construction technology, medical technology, and information technology.\\nThe human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.\\nTechnology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of the Earth and its environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.\\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.

Diversity Design is a new form of socially responsible design discipline defined by Dragan Loncar. Like ecological design that helps sustainability of the environment, or design that helps people with special needs, this form of design helps with inclusion of people marginalised by race, gender and sexual orientation. It is a subtle and non-intrusive intervention on consumer products packaging and POS to invite these minorities into the mainstream of society. As an intelligent design, it could be shy in less tolerant societies, and it could reveal itself in full glory where its features appear to be advantageous. Sometimes, with its accidental use, situations filled with light humour could arise and make otherwise unaware people think positively about diversity in nature. It also encourages conscious individuals to express their love of diversity, and therefore stretch brand's target audience to the widest corners of society. This kind of social awareness through design can create huge benefits both to businesses and community, since it's generating free publicity, otherwise hardly obtainable in this highly competitive world.

Litter can also be used as a verb. To litter means to throw (often man-made) objects onto the ground and leave them unremoved, as opposed to disposing of them properly.\\n\\nIt is a human impact on the environment and is a serious environmental issue in many countries. Litter can exist in the environment for long periods of time before degrading and be transported large distances into the world's oceans. Litter can affect quality of life.\\n\\nCigarette butts are the most littered item in the world, with 4.5 trillion discarded annually. The cellulose acetate butts are not biodegradable and, as a result, their chemical decomposition can take many decades.[1]
A Conjoined Wealth Fund (CWF) is a relatively small privately-owned investment fund or group of funds composed of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, property, precious metals or other financial instruments. Conjoined wealth funds invest funds globally to take advantage of the global growth and opportunities; however, they keep a strict domestic reinvestment mission in order to subsidize depleted governmental revenues. \\n\\nSome conjoined wealth funds are held solely by a non-profit or faith based organization, who accumulate the funds in the course of their management existing missions and donor initiatives of a small community; this type of fund is usually of major economic and fiscal importance to the region. Other conjoined wealth funds are simply the savings small for-profit businesses that depend heavily on a local community, invested by various entities for the purposes of investment return, and which may not have significant role in fiscal management.\\n\\nThe accumulated funds are used to prop up local communities too dense to receive the highest quality of goods and services a sovereign nation has to offer, as well as sparse communities that present obvious and long standing tax anomalies. While conjoined wealth funds engage the global equity markets, their core investment focus is assisting the state to create self sufficient communities and cities.
== '''scope of physics''' ==\\n\\nPhysics is closely related to the other natural sciences and, in a sense, encompasses them. Chemistry, for example, deals with the interaction of atoms to form molecules; much of modern geology is largely a study of the physics of the earth and is known as geophysics; and astronomy deals with the physics of the stars and outer space. Even living systems are made up of fundamental particles and, as studied in biophysics and biochemistry, they follow the same types of laws as the simpler particles traditionally studied by a physicist.\\n\\nThe emphasis on the interaction between particles in modern physics, known as the microscopic approach, must often be supplemented by a macroscopic approach that deals with larger elements or systems of particles. This macroscopic approach is indispensable to the application of physics to much of modern technology. Thermodynamics, for example, a branch of physics developed during the 19th century, deals with the elucidation and measurement of properties of a system as a whole and remains useful in other fields of physics; it also forms the basis of much of chemical and mechanical engineering. Such properties as the temperature, pressure, and volume of a gas have no meaning for an individual atom or molecule; these thermodynamic concepts can only be applied directly to a very large system of such particles. A bridge exists, however, between the microscopic and macroscopic approach; another branch of physics, known as statistical mechanics, indicates how pressure and temperature can be related to the motion of atoms and molecules on a statistical basis
Laser Safety \\n \\nDirect eye contact with the output beam from the laser will cause serious damage and possible blindness.\\nThe safe use of lasers requires that all laser users, and everyone near the laser system, are aware of the dangers involved. The safe use of the laser depends upon the user being familiar with the instrument and the characteristics of laser light.\\nIf the laser beam is reflected or scattered from various objects, it is very dangerous. Avoid physical contact with the laser beam. The high spectral intensity and short wavelength may cause tissue damage which is not immediately evident.\\n\\n \\nDo not permit any reflective object in the path of the beam. Scattering the beam from a reflective surface can be very damaging to the eyes or skin.\\n \\nBlock the beam when not in use.\\n \\nTurn the beam off, preventing stray reflections from occurring either between experiments or when moving the laser.\\n \\nIf possible, have an enclosed path for the laser beam.\\n \\nAlways point the laser at a specific target, such as a power meter.\\n \\nLimit access to the laser to qualified users who are familiar with laser safety practices and who are aware of the dangers involved.\\n \\nPost warning signs indicating the laser is being used.\\n \\nNever point the laser beam at anyone's' eyes.\\nCDRH (Center for Devices & Radiological Health)\\nA department of the United States Food and Drug Administration, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health establishes the safety regulations and requirements governing the manufacture of lasers and laser devices within the United States, along with many other responsibilities.
\\n                        \\n== '''THERMAL POLLUTION''' ==\\n\\n\\nThermal pollution is the degradation of water quality by any process that changes ambient water temperature. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. When water used as a coolant is returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature, the change in temperature impacts organisms by (a) decreasing oxygen supply, and (b) affecting ecosystem composition. Urban runoff--stormwater discharged to surface waters from roads and parking lots--can also be a source of elevated water temperatures.\\n\\nWhen a power plant first opens or shuts down for repair, fish and other organisms adapted to particular temperature range can be killed by the abrupt rise in water temperature known as 'thermal shock'.\\n\\nThermal pollution can also be caused by the release of very cold water from the base of reservoirs into warmer rivers. This affects fish (particularly their eggs and larvae), macroinvertebrates and river productivity.\\n\\nContents [hide]\\n1 Ecological effects — warm water \\n2 Ecological effects — cold water \\n3 Control of thermal pollution \\n4 See also \\n5 References \\n \\n\\n\\n[edit] Ecological effects — warm water\\nElevated temperature typically decreases the level of dissolved oxygen (DO) in water. The decrease in levels of DO can harm aquatic animals such as fish, amphibians and copepods. Thermal pollution may also increase the metabolic rate of aquatic animals, as enzyme activity, resulting in these organisms consuming more food in a shorter time than if their environment were not changed. An increased metabolic rate may result in food source shortages, causing a sharp decrease in a population. Changes in the environment may also result in a migration of organisms to another, more suitable environment, and to in-migration of fishes that normally only live in warmer waters elsewhere. This leads to competition for fewer resources; the more adapted organisms moving in may have an advantage over organisms that are not used to the warmer temperature. As a result one has the problem of compromising food chains of the old and new environments. Biodiversity can be decreased as a result.\\n\\n \\nFish killed in receiving watersIt is known that temperature changes of even one to two degrees Celsius can cause significant changes in organism metabolism and other adverse cellular biology effects. Principal adverse changes can include rendering cell walls less permeable to necessary osmosis, coagulation of cell proteins, and alteration of enzyme metabolism. These cellular level effects can adversely affect mortality and reproduction.\\n\\nPrimary producers are affected by warm water because higher water temperature increases plant growth rates, resulting in a shorter lifespan and species overpopulation. This can cause an algae bloom which reduces the oxygen levels in the water. The higher plant density leads to an increased plant respiration rate because the reduced light intensity decreases photosynthesis. This is similar to the eutrophication that occurs when watercourses are polluted with leached agricultural inorganic fertilizers.\\n\\nA large increase in temperature can lead to the denaturing of life-supporting enzymes by breaking down hydrogen- and disulphide bonds within the quaternary structure of the enzymes. Decreased enzyme activity in aquatic organisms can cause problems such as the inability to break down lipids, which leads to malnutrition.\\n\\nIn limited cases, warm water has little deleterious effect and may even lead to improved function of the receiving aquatic ecosystem. This phenomenon is seen especially in seasonal waters and is known as thermal enrichment. An extreme case is derived from the aggregational habits of the manatee, which often uses power plant discharge sites during winter. Projections suggest that manatee populations would decline upon the removal of these discharges.\\n\\nThe temperature can be as high as 70° Fahrenheit for freshwater, 80° F for saltwater, and 85° F for tropical fish.[clarification needed]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Ecological effects — cold water\\nReleases of unnaturally cold water from reservoirs can dramatically change the fish and macroinvertebrate fauna of rivers, and reduce river productivity. In Australia, where many rivers have warmer temperature regimes, native fish species have been eliminated, and macroinvertebrate fauna have been drastically altered and impoverished. The temperatures for freshwater fish can be as low as 50° F, saltwater 75° F, and tropical 80° F.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Control of thermal pollution\\n \\nCooling tower at Gustav Knepper Power Station, Dortmund, GermanyIndustrial wastewater\\nIn the United States, thermal pollution from industrial sources is generated mostly by power plants, petroleum refineries, pulp and paper mills, chemical plants, steel mills and smelters.[2] [3] Heated water from these sources may be controlled with:\\n\\ncooling ponds, man-made bodies of water designed for cooling by evaporation, convection, and radiation \\ncooling towers, which transfer waste heat to the atmosphere through evaporation and/or heat transfer \\ncogeneration, a process where waste heat is recycled for domestic and/or industrial heating purposes. \\nSome facilities use once-through cooling (OTC) systems which do not reduce temperature as effectively as the above systems. For example, the Potrero Generating Station in San Francisco, which uses OTC, discharges water to San Francisco Bay approximately 10° C (20° F) above the ambient bay temperature.[4]\\n\\n\\nUrban runoff\\nDuring warm weather, urban runoff can have significant thermal impacts on small streams, as stormwater passes over hot parking lots, roads and sidewalks. Stormwater management facilities that absorb runoff or direct it into groundwater, such as bioretention systems and infiltration basins, can reduce these thermal effects. Retention basins tend to be less effective at reducing temperature, as the water may be heated by the sun before being discharged to a receiving stream.[5]\\n\\n\\n[edit] See also\\nWater cooling \\nWater pollution \\nWater quality \\n\\n[edit] References\\n^ Selna, Robert (2009).

The temperature change can be upwards or downwards. \\nThe major sources of thermal pollution are power plants and industrial factories. In most power plants, heat is produced when coal, oil, or natural gas is burned or nuclear fuels undergo fission to release huge amounts of energy. \\nThis heat turns water to steam, which spins turbines to produce electricity. After cooling the used steam must be cooled and condensed back into water. To condense the steam, cool water is brought into the plant and circulated next to the hot steam. In this process, the water used for cooling increases 5 to 10 Celsius degrees.\\nIndustries such as metalworking use large amounts of water as coolant, and then release this water back into a nearby source, such as a lake or river. The released water then has a \\nhigher water temperature than the source of water, which then increases the temperature of that particular body of water. This affects the Aquatic organisms, as they are extremely sensitive to temperature change, in which when subject to this temperature change, like many other animals and plants pose the risk of dying of Thermal Shock.\\nIf these organisms die in that particular body of water, it poses a threat of disrupting/damaging the food chain, potentially leading to many other animals dying from starvation or in other instances overpopulation.

The World Institute of Sustainable Energy (WISE) is a not-for-profit institute set up in June 2004 to promote sustainable energy, energy conservation, and sustainable development. In particular, the institution is committed towards addressing the shortcomings existing in the sustainable energy sector in India, viz. lack of policy support and incentives, lack of legislative and research support, lack of qualified manpower, and lack of critical awareness that would lead to the transition to a sustainable energy-based economy. Since its inception, WISE has pioneered several initiatives for accelerating the development of sustainable energy in the country.
\\n\\nMusical Characteristics of Rap Hip-hop culture, once confined to the streets has broken into the commercial realm with force. Hip hop records top the charts week after week, rap videos have taken control of MTV, BET and the BOX, and there are dozens of hip hop magazines on the newsstands. A stroll on any city street in the United States reveals the proliferation of hip-hop styled apparel. The culture itself had much humbler beginnings, however. On the street corners and in the parks, young men and women battled through freestyle rhymes and dance moves. Whatever the time period, and whoever he MC may have been, Rap has incorporated, and included several of the “classical” musical characteristics present in most western music today. These characteristics have influenced the popularity of this genre from coast to coast; as well as, giving the music a chance to penetrate into the homes of a vast array of people (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc.). When one is referring to certain musical characteristics, pitch, dynamics, timbre, rhythm, melody, harmony, key, texture, form, and various others are usually mentioned. It is fascinating to see how many of these characteristics are present in the hip-hop culture, more specifical.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe loves to dance rap write songs and acting.com

B.G. Burkett, however, ignores the statistics of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Almost all legitimate sources state that a significant number of Vietnam combat veterans suffer from some degree of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Perhaps the most recent and most accurate of the study of these veterans, their pyschological disorders and consequences are described in Dr. Jonathans Shay's two highly accalimed books "Achilles in Vietnam" and "Odysseus in America." The treatment of Vietnam Veterans by both pro and anti-war groups, and the population in general, upon their return to America and the cultural milieu into which they re-entered caused a host of profound complex and often debilitating consequences for these veterans. Many of these veterans, almost forty years later, still carry the weight of these disorders and do not fully participate in the mainstream of American society. Rather they remain as "outliers" unable to comprehend why American society has rejected them.
\\n== World War III ==\\nThe nuclear war started in the Northern Hemisphere and lasted for thirty-nine days. Newspapers and radio stations had ceased operations during the war, so many people were left without knowledge of how or why everything started. Yet what was truly occurring was that Albania had initiated an Arab-Israeli war, which led to a Russia-NATO war, which led to a Russo-Chinese war. Atomic bombs fell all over the Northern Hemisphere.\\n== The Left-over Radiation ==\\n The radiation is spreading south steadily. The wind currents a slowly blowing the radiation to the Southern Hemisphere even though all the bombs were dropped in the Northern Hemisphere, thousands of miles away.There is simply nothing that can be done to stop the wind currents. The equatorial trade winds slow down the radiation but do not completely stop it from drifting. It is estimated that once the radiation has started spreading, it would take six months, give or take 3 months, for the radiation to fully take over the Southern Hemisphere as it has in the Northern Hemisphere. There seems to be no kind of life up north and those countries that already have  high radiation are infected so there is nothing that could be done to save them.\\n[[File:301905 281406401890345 508002931 n large]]

It is true that during that\\ntime period the most powerful countries in Europe tended not to fight with\\neach other. This tranquility contrasted strongly with the era of the French\\nRevolution and Napoleon (1789–1815), when large numbers of Europeans\\nfought and died for the sake of their nations and empires. By comparison, the\\nperiod from 1815 to 1914 does seem relatively tranquil. The relative absence\\nof warfare between nations allowed for a major burst in industrialization and\\ntechnological development, which resulted in disruptions, to be sure, even\\nas the overall standard of living rose in most places.\\nYet this era cannot honestly be described as an era of complete tranquility.\\nIn the middle of the century, major conflicts were associated with the\\nunification of the German and Italian nations. In response to the forces of\\nnationalism, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire fought\\nto stave off disintegration. Meanwhile, Britain and France—and to a lesser\\ndegree Germany, Italy, Japan, Portugal, and the United States—expanded\\ntheir empires overseas. For the most part, their colonies were obtained by\\nshedding the blood of the native inhabitants and, to a lesser extent, the\\nblood of their own soldiers.\\nThe building of nations, empires, and industries was the main feature of\\nEuropean, Japanese, and U.S. history in the period from 1850 to 1914.

Project R&R: Release and Restitution for Chimpanzees is NEAVS’ national campaign to end the use of chimpanzees in invasive biomedical research and provide them permanent release and restitution in sanctuary. The historic work of Project R&R will lead to the first non-human species being afforded legal protection from use in harmful research. \\n\\nThe U.S. is the only remaining country to hold large numbers of chimpanzees in laboratories.  Even in the U.S., their use in active protocols has steadily declined due to ethical concerns, the enormous expense of using and housing them in laboratories, and the scientific limitations and failures of the chimpanzee as a model for humans. Yet U.S. labs confine some 1,065 chimpanzees.
Saving the valuable resources of earth.....\\n\\nTime v/s effective utilization of Natural resources\\n\\nWith the growing generation gap & 'time is money' attitude, no one thinks how important natural resources are. Our lives have become so luxurious that we rarely think about saving the precious resources of earth...We do not realise that the luxuries (commodities that save human energy & time) we get are sometimes (actually most of the times) are at the cost of destroying our natural resources & we take them for granted either knowingly or unknowingly. In fact these luxuries make man forget how to use/ save natural resources effectively. However there have been significant efforts in creating awareness through various mediums and forums. \\n \\nFor instance: This years noble peace prize is awarded jointly to the UN sponsored Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change ( IPCC ) and Albert Arnold Gore Jr, the ex-vice president of USA for their effort to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundation for the measures that are needed to counteract such changes. This very recognition brings home the point that such issues have assumed very serious proportions now and every stake holder has to take notice of the same and do the needful at their end.\\n\\nSo, what are we all waiting for....Go Green!!  Save earth. \\n\\nYour small effort to save natural resources can make a huge difference to the world...
'''Transnational Governance'''\\n\\nThe concept of transnational governance is seen by many as a rather new category of governance. But it’s not because few or no literature are available on a precise topics that this topics didn’t exist. \\n\\nThe amount of literature around governance become more and more big but nothing is still available on transnational governance.\\n\\nReach good transnational governance could lead to real economic, social  improvements as well as alleviating poverty,  eliminating illiteracy or reducing infant and maternal mortality in deprived area. These transnational improvements could be much easier to reach if the countries involved in this kind of multi-national area share a common identity.\\n\\nThus, the idea of common identity could have a central place in the definition of transnational governance.
 \\nMousa Bani Baker \\nA PhD candidate in the faculty of Engineering and Computer Science- Concordia University-Montreal, specializing in Geo-environmental engineering. My research is focused on protecting the environment and more specifically on designing a new liner material to protect the ground water table from toxic materials. It amazed me to learn that fresh water represents only 3.5% of the Earth’s total water. Of that 3.5%, two-thirds is ground water. Protecting this resource from toxic chemicals is incredibly important and is why I am committed to pursuing research in this area. Since my childhood I have been involved with environmental activism, beginning with volunteering for clubs and moving on to research and professional work as I got older. I am a strong believer that we have the responsibility to teach our children and raise their awareness about environmental issues. During my spare time I enjoy teaching children English as a second language, mathematics and physics.
Jet aircraft of the type from which this data was collected typically fly at altitudes greater than 10,000 m; well above the vertical limit of human survivability. Pressure and temperature outside the cabin on this flight are about 26 kPa (one-quarter atmosphere) and -60 °C, respectively. That's low enough that most humans would suffocate in under thirty seconds and freeze solid in a few hours.\\n\\nAlthough the environmental conditions outside are harsh, life inside a jet isn't all that bad. While passengers would find it most comfortable if the cabin was kept at one atmosphere there are engineering and economic reasons to maintain the pressure at a lower value. During this flight the cabin pressure was kept at a compromise value of 81 kPa -- much higher than the pressure outside, but still lower than what most people live under. (80 kPa is the average atmospheric pressure at an elevation of 2000 m.) Temperature hardly varied at all, staying nearly constant at 23 °C. (People are far more sensitive to temperature changes than to pressure changes.)\\n\\nWhen air is drawn into the cabin from outside, to what temperature does it rise after it has been compressed?\\n\\n\\n\\nif someone could help me with an answer and explanation for that please.
The purpose of this policy, known as the “Canary Initiative” is to drastically reduce Aspen’s carbon footprint. Because of Aspen’s high-end reputation, the carbon level this city emits is significantly higher than a similar-sized city. The initiative received its name from the idea that Aspen’s climate is a “canary in a coal mine”; that is, Aspen's climate could be significantly altered by events and changes from outside areas. Aspen is a popular resort destination for its ski mountains, and tourism is a key component in the business Aspen receives. However, with rising global temperatures, Aspen’s snow is estimated to disappear entirely by 2100. In order to prevent irreversible damage to the natural environment, while sustaining and developing Aspen's economy, this city-wide initiative was created. The initiative calls for: a greenhouse gas emissions inventory, an assessment of impacts of global and local climate change, an education and action plan for advocacy on regional, state, and national levels. \\n\\n'''Aspen’s 2000 IPCC Report'''\\n\\nIn 2000, the city of Aspen and the Aspen Skiing Company launched a study of the effects of rising temperatures on Aspen and the surrounding mountains. Using state-of the art climate prediction models, as well as unique physical and geographical data for Aspen, the report illustrated the consequences of various actions of humankind. The following data is from the results of the study. In the low emissions scenario (global greenhouse gas levels peak at or around 500 ppm), Aspen was expected to experience about 6 degrees F of warming by 2100, giving Aspen a climate more similar to Los Alamos, New Mexico. Under the “business as usual” scenario, GHG levels would peak around 700 ppm, and Aspen would experience 14 degrees F of warming by 2100, giving it a climate more like Amarillo, Texas. In both of these scenarios, Aspen’s snowpack is dramatically reduced; in the “business-as-usual” scenario the snowpack is virtually non-existent by 2100. Because of the alarming results of the IPCC report, Aspen and the Aspen Skiing Company quickly mobilized to clean up—their business depends on it. Several adverse effects on the spring runoff and ecosystems of Aspen were also mentioned, most notably the peak spring discharge occurring earlier in the year, and an increase of summer droughts. \\n\\n'''Greenhouse Gas Reductions'''\\n\\nIn 2005, the City of Aspen made and signed a legally-binding contract to reduce its GHG emissions by at least 1% every year. By the end of 2006 Aspen had reduced its emissions by 11.5%, and new, more stringent community reduction goals were made. The Canary Initiative requires GHG emissions to be cut by 30% (from 2004 levels) by 2020, and 80% reduction by mid-century.\\n\\n'''Canary Action Plan'''\\n\\nThe Canary Action Plan details the emission cuts or general improvements that need to be made in several sectors of business. Sectors include: policy, research, and education; energy efficient buildings; ground and air transportation, electricity (higher percentage of renewable), landfill waste reduction/recycling programs, and finally carbon credits to offset extra GHG produced.\\n\\n''Policy, Research, and Education:''\\n•	Ensure that education and policy decisions at all levels – government, business, and individual – seek to significantly reduce GHG emissions\\n•	Provide education, in a variety of venues, and data needed by the community to understand the need for action to reduce global warming\\n\\n''Buildings: Energy Efficiency:''\\n•	Reduce GHG’s 20% below 2004 levels in all City of Aspen facilities by 2009\\n•	Require all new construction (commercial and residential) to be 50% more energy efficient than the International Energy Conservation Code by 2009.\\n•	Encourage and incentivize existing buildings (commercial and residential) to reduce GHG emissions 20% below 2004 levels by 2009\\n\\n''Air and Ground Transportation''\\n•	Reduce the volume of single occupancy traffic into Aspen and around town.\\n•	Create a mass transit-oriented transportation alternative into Aspen that is more convenient and affordable and has lower GHG emissions per passenger mile than the average private vehicle.\\n•	Increase the use of highly fuel-efficient and low emissions fuel engines and machinery in on-road and off-road vehicles.\\n•	Require that all new development projects have a net decrease in transportation related emissions compared to existing development conditions\\n•	Reduce emissions from air travel\\n\\n''Electricity:'' Generate and/or purchase 45% of Aspen’s electricity from renewable resources by 2012.\\n\\n''Landfill:'' Waste Reduction and Recycling\\n•	Increase the overall solid waste recycling rate by 20% over the 2006 baseline by 2009.\\n•	Decrease the amount of solid waste generated\\n\\n''Localization'': Carbon Offsets, Food, and Other\\n•	Provide a reliable and effective option to offset GHG emissions\\n•	Educate City staff and the community on the global warming impacts of the industrialized food supply chain and encourage the cultivation and purchase of locally produced foods\\n\\n<reference>http://aspenpitkin.com/Living-in-the-Valley/Green-Initiatives/Canary-Initiative/\\n<reference/>

'''    The uniqueness of Ayurveda, science of life, lies in its positive approach to life. Life is for living fully, fulfilling one, for which both sound health and a normal life span are indispensable. Ill health and a short span of life are negation to life. Ayurveda therefore insists on an understanding, by man of his relationship with nature and society he lives in, and of his living in harmony with both. Ayurveda works not only as a simple health care system, but a lifestyle able to maintain the body in perfect harmony with nature. It gives prime importance to individuals as a whole in his physical, mental and spiritual levels considering his condition, temperament, environment and even habits to design the healing process as well as enabling him for a healthy living. The promotive, preventive, corrective and curative aspects of healthcare and the medicines possessing such properties are indeed the strength of Ayurveda.\\n\\n   Heart disease has earned the reputation of being a merciless killer, which robs the human life in its prime. Its blow either proves fatal or causes considerable disability. It is one of the most serious maladies, not only in western countries, but also in the east. The incidence of this dreaded disease is rising and in recent years it has become the greatest menace to mankind.\\n\\n   Although extensive work has been done in modern medicine in the diagnosis and management of Heart diseases, efforts on the prevention of the disease in the population is still unsatisfactory. This is an area in which there is a definite scope for Ayurveda, by the modification of risk factors aiming at prevention of heart diseases.
== Waste Free Oceans (WFO) ==\\n\\nWaste Free Oceans is an industry-led initiative with the aim of reducing floating marine debris on Europe’s coastlines and waters by 2020.Using existing fishing trawls and new technology, WFO will engage Europe’s fishing community in cleaning up floating marine debris and bring it back to land for recycling and sorting. The time has come to act together in tackling this growing problem and ensuring the health and purity of Europe’s coastal waters.\\n\\n\\n\\n'''An Industry led European-wide initiative to clean up Coastal waters in Europe.'''\\n\\nThere are many factors that have contributed to a rise in marine litter: poor waste management practices in ports and marinas, dumping by ships and vessels, not to mention\\ngeneral public attitudes towards littering are all reasons for this growing problem. The implications of an increase in marine litter are far reaching - affecting both human health and the ecosystem. Although this is a global issue it is time for Europe to show leadership in solving this problem. \\n\\n\\n'''Willingness to provide solutions'''\\n\\nThe Waste Free Oceans Foundation has initiated this marine litter project in order to provide a solution to the problem of floating marine debris. Boats outfitted with a special trawl will be able to collect between 2-8 tones of waste (per trawl) for cleaning & recycling.Using the knowledge of fishermen and homegrown technology, the project aims to educate all stakeholders in tackling debris on Europe’s coastlines and waters by 2020.\\n\\n<ref>www.wastefreeoceans.eu</ref>
I WAS ASKED TO DO THIS BY SOME PEOPLE IN FORM 2 IN SVGS\\nTHIS WAS A GEOGRAPHY ASSIGNMENT GIVEN TO THEM AND \\nPEOPLE DID NOT KNOW THE ANSWERS SO I AM GIVING YOU THEM \\nYOU ARE WELCOME AND ALSO GIVE JAVID A DOLLAR IF U ARE IN GRAMMER SCHOOL\\n\\nHOW ACTIVE IS IT?\\n\\nOver the years there have been a number of activities affecting the earth.  The movement of the earth’s plates\\n have resulted In Volcanic eruptions, Earthquakes and Tsunamis. Many lives have been lost and the geographic \\nfeatures of the earth’s surface have been altered significantly.\\nThe advancement of technology have allowed us to predict many of these occurrences and helped us to better\\n prepare by choosing where we live or where we build homes and structures that can withstand some of the effects \\nof what we now know as ‘natural disasters’.\\nThere are various sites and locations on earth that are noted for earth activities, while others are noted for its peace \\nand tranquillity.\\nThis is due to the movement of the earth’s tectonic plates. Countries such as Japan, Hawaii, California, Haiti, and \\nNew Zealand are noted for there volcanic eruptions and earthquakes while others such as St. Vincent and the Grenadines,\\nBarbados, St. Lucia are rated for there resilience to earth activity and have fewer instances of earth movement that result \\nin catastrophic damages.\\n\\n\\nWAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE MONITOR AND PREPARE FOR EARTHQUAKE ACTIVITY\\n\\nEarthquakes are not as easy to predict as volcanic eruptions. However, there are still some ways of monitoring the chances\\nof an earthquake:\\n•	A seismometer is used to pick up the vibrations in the Earth’s crust.  An increase in vibrations may indicate a possible \\n       earthquake.\\nRadon Gas escapes from cracks in the Earth’s crust.  Levels of radon gas can be monitored – a sudden increase may suggest\\nan earthquake.  Many of the prediction techniques used to monitor earthquakes are not 100 percent reliable.  Planning and \\npreparing for an earthquake is therefore very important.\\n•	People living in earthquake zones need to know what they should do in the event of a quake.  Training people may involve\\n      holding earthquake drills and educating people via Television and Radio.\\n•	People may put together emergency kits and store them in their homes.  An emergency kit may includes:  first-aid items, \\n     blankets and tinned food.\\n•	Earthquake-proof buildings have been constructed in many major cities, eg: the Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco.\\nBuildings such as this are designed to absorb the energy of an earthquake and to withstand the movement of the Earth.\\nRoads and Bridges can also be designed to withstand the power of earthquakes.\\n\\n\\n\\nTWO LINKS BETWEEN PLATE AND ACTIVENESS\\n	The location of particular faults and plate boundaries are heavy determinants in predicting why certain areas\\nare more prone to earthquakes than others.\\n Colliding Plates\\nWhere plates come into contact, energy is released. Plates sliding past each other cause friction and heat.  Sub ducting\\nPlates melt into the mantle, and diverging plates create new crust material.\\nSubducting plates, where one tectonic plate is being driven under another, are associated with volcanoes and earthquakes.\\nThis activity is focused along the edge of the plate boundary where two plates come into contact, forming regions such as the \\nPacific Ring of Fire, a chain of earthquake and volcanic activity around the edge of the Pacific Ocean – which generates 75% \\nof the world’s volcanoes and 80% of the world’s earthquakes.\\nDivergent boundaries (construction) occur where two plates slide apart from each other.  Mid-ocean ridges (eg: Mid-Atlantic Ridge)\\nAnd active zones of rifting (such as Africa’s East Africa Rift) are both examples of divergent boundaries.\\n\\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF PLATE BOUNDARIES\\nThere are 3 primary types of Tectonic Plates Boundaries:\\n•	Divergent boundaries\\n•	Convergent boundaries\\n•	Transform boundaries\\nDIVERGENT BOUNDARIES\\nAs divergent boundaries new crust is created as two or more plates pull away \\nfrom each other.  Oceans are born and grow wider where plates diverge or pull\\napart.   As seen below, when a diverging boundary occurs on land a ‘rift’ or \\nseparation will arise and over time that mass of land will break apart into distinct\\nland masses and the surrounding water will fill the space between them.\\n\\nCONVERGENT BOUNDARIES\\nHere crust is destroyed and recycled back into the interior of the Earth as one plate dives under\\nAnother.  These are known as Subduction Zones – mountains and volcanoes are often found where\\nplates converge.  There are 3 types of convergent boundaries: Oceanic-Continental Convergence;\\nOceanic-Oceanic Convergence;  and Continental-Continental Convergence.\\n\\nTRANSFORM-FAULT BOUNDARIES\\n\\nTransform-Fault Boundaries are where two plates are sliding horizontally past one another.  These are also\\nknown as transform boundaries or more commonly as faults.  Most transform faults are found on the ocean floor.\\nThey commonly offset active spreading ridges, producing zig-zag plate margins, and are generally defined by \\nshallow earthquakes.  A few, however, occur on land.  \\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF VOLCANIC ACTIVITY:\\nThere are several different types volcanic activities such as:\\n•	Hawaiian eruption\\n•	Strombolian eruption\\n•	Vulcanian eruption\\n•	Plinian eruption\\n•	Lava domes\\n•	Surtseyan eruption\\n\\n\\nHawaiian Eruption\\nIn a Hawaiian Eruption, fluid basaltic lava is thrown into the air in jets\\nfrom a vent or line of vents (a fissure) at the summit or on the flank of a \\nvolcano.  The jets can last for hours or even days, a phenomenon \\nknown as fire fountaining.\\n\\nStrombolian Eruption\\nStrombolian eruuptions are distinct burst of fluid lava (usually basalt of basaltic andesite)\\nfor the mouth of a magma-filled summit conduit.\\n\\n\\nVULCANIAN ERUPTION\\nA Vulcanina eruption is a short, violent, relatively small explosion of viscous magma\\n(usually andesite, dacite, or rhyolite). This type of eruption results from the fragmentation\\nand explosion of a plug of lava in a volcanic conduit, or from the rupture of a lava dome\\n(viscous lava that piles up over a vent).\\n\\nPLINIAN ERUPTION\\nThe largest and most violent of all the types of volcanic eruptions are Plinian eruptions.\\nThey are caused by the fragmentation of gassy magma, and are usually associated with\\nvery viscous magmas(dacite and rhyolite).\\n\\nLAVA DOMES\\nLava Domes form when very viscous, rubbly lava (usually andesite, dacite or rhyolite) is\\nsqueezed out of a vent without exploding.  The lava piles up into a dome, which may grow \\nby inflating from the inside  or by squeezing out lobes of lava (something like toothpaste\\ncoming out of a tube).  These lava lobes can be short and blobby, long and thin, or even\\nform spikes that rise ens of meters into the air before they fall over.\\n\\nSURTSEYAN ERUPTION\\nSurtseyan eruptions are kind of hydro magmatic eruption, where magma or lava interacts\\nexplosively with water.  In most cases, Surtseyan eruptions occur when an undersea \\nvolcano has finally grown large enough to break the water’s surface.
