\\n \\nGraphical description of risks and impacts from global warming from the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\nThe predicted effects of global warming on the environment and for human life are numerous and varied. It is generally difficult to attribute specific natural phenomena to long-term causes, but some effects of recent climate change may already be occurring. Raising sea levels, glacier retreat, Arctic shrinkage, and altered patterns of agriculture are cited as direct consequences, but predictions for secondary and regional effects include extreme weather events, an expansion of tropical diseases, changes in the timing of seasonal patterns in ecosystems, and drastic economic impact. Concerns have led to political activism advocating proposals to mitigate, eliminate, or adapt to it.\\nThe 2007 Fourth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) includes a summary of the expected effects.\\n\\n Global warming is responsible in part for some trends in natural disasters such as extreme weather\\n\\nLewis Glacier, North Cascades, WA USA is one of five glaciers in the area that melted away \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\nRetreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland
                                          Rocks And Minerals\\n\\nWhat are rocks?\\n\\nMaking up the majority of the Earth's crust, rock is usually defined as a mixture of common minerals. Rocks can be hard or soft, as small as a grain or as large as a building. They have been an integral part of the history of mankind, first being used as tools for hunting and defense, and as a building materials to construct shelters and monuments. Combined with the effects of tectonics, weathering and vegetation, rocks define the natural landscapes we see around us. The minerals and metals we find in rocks are essential to the prosperity and cultural splendor of human civilization. There are many kinds of rock, and they can be classified in a number of ways. However, geologists classify rocks based on how the rocks were formed. The three classes are igneous rocks (formed directly from liquid rock), metamorphic rocks (formed by direct alteration of existing rocks), and sedimentary rocks (formed by eroded materials from other rocks).
Home to millions of species,[11] including humans, Earth is the only place in the universe where life is known to exist. The planet formed 4.54 billion years ago,[12][13][14][15] and life appeared on its surface within a billion years. Since then, Earth's biosphere has significantly altered the atmosphere and other abiotic conditions on the planet, enabling the proliferation of aerobic organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which, together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks harmful radiation, permitting life on land.[16] The physical properties of the Earth, as well as its geological history and orbit, allowed life to persist during this period. The world is expected to continue supporting life for another 1.5 billion years, after which the rising luminosity of the Sun will eliminate the biosphere.[17]\\n\\nEarth's outer surface is divided into several rigid segments, or tectonic plates, that gradually migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of the surface is covered with salt-water oceans, the remainder consisting of continents and islands; liquid water, necessary for all known life, is not known to exist on any other planet's surface.[note 4][note 5] Earth's interior remains active, with a thick layer of relatively solid mantle, a liquid outer core that generates a magnetic field, and a solid iron inner core
Direct carbon conversion units could be used to generate electric power for the grid. Such a power plant would be "large, but not gigantic." Advanced combustion, fuel cells, nuclear and renewable energy, and conservation may all combine to help the situation in a way that cannot presently be predicted.It is vitally important to develop a simple fuel cell technology that greatly increases the yield of electric energy from each unit of fossil fuel, uses fuels derived efficiently from almost any fossil fuel, significantly decreases the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, and makes it easy to capture the carbon dioxide for sequestration or other use.Clearly, we’re just beginning to hear about direct carbon conversion.
Nanotechnology (sometimes shortened to "nano tech") is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale. Generally, nanotechnology works with materials, devices, and other structures with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. Quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale. With a variety of potential applications, nanotechnology is a key technology for the future and governments have invested billions of dollars in its research. Through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars. The European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars.[1]\\n\\nNanotechnology is very diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale. Nanotechnology entails the application of fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, micro fabrication, etc.\\n\\nScientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in medicine, electronics, bio materials and energy production. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nano-materials,[2] and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.

'''Rain Forest and Carbon\\n'''\\n\\nA hectare of mature rain forest (already containing 200 tonnes of carbon as stock) can absorb an extra 6 tonnes of carbon a year, negating the belief that mature forests are at 'equilibrium' and lose their capacity as a sink at maturity. \\n\\nTropical forests act as a stock of a significant amount of carbon (containing over 430 Gt or million tonnes carbon globally), whilst capacity to act as a carbon sink can absorb over third of fossil fuel combustion and cement production each year . \\n\\nAnnual Carbon emissions due to deforestation in south-east Asia equal almost half the total annual carbon emitted from fossil fuel combustion  \\n\\nMost areas of Southern American rain forests act as sinks (although some areas are sources), with the total uptake of carbon = 0.5 Gt per year. However, CO2 is produced from the banks of the Amazon River, from the decomposition of litter, which may provide a reconciliation (and balance) of figures from the annual amount absorbed by the Amazon Basin as a whole.  \\n\\nPrevention of deforestation would not only reduce carbon emissions, as well as avoiding the huge emissions caused by clearance and safe-guarding the absorption capabilities of the tropical biosphere. \\n\\nManaging the biosphere effectively could contribute to mitigating climate change in the short term, through afforestation and the prevention of deforestation.\\n\\nhttp://www.netbot.org
A tsunami (pronounced /(t)suːˈnɑːmi/) is a series of waves created when a body of water, such as an ocean, is rapidly displaced. Earthquakes, mass movements above or below water, some volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions, landslides, underwater earthquakes, large asteroid impacts and testing with nuclear weapons at sea all have the potential to generate a tsunami. The effects of a tsunami can be devastating due to the immense volumes of water and energy involved. Since meteorites are small, they will not generate a tsunami.\\n\\nThe Greek historian Thucydides was the first to relate tsunamis to submarine quakes,[1] [2] but understanding of the nature of tsunamis remained slim until the 20th century and is the subject of ongoing research.\\n\\nMany early geological, geographic, oceanographic etc; texts refer to "Seismic sea waves" - these are now referred to as "tsunami."\\n\\nSome meteorological storm conditions - deep depressions causing cyclones, hurricanes; can generate a storm surge which can be several metres above normal tide levels. This is due to the low atmospheric pressure within the centre of the depression. As these storm surges come ashore the surge can resemble a tsunami, inundating vast areas of land. These are not tsunami. Such a storm surge inundated Burma (Myanmar) in May 20</nowiki>
By Martin F. Downs\\n\\n           In November 2004, a panel of experts testified before a Senate subcommittee that a pornographic products which millions of Americans consume is dangerously addictive. They were talking about pornography.The effects of porn on the brain were called "toxic" and compared to cocaine. One psychologist, Geryy Magera claimed "prolonged exposure to pornography stimulates a preference for depictions of group sex, sadomasochistic practices, and sexual contact with animals." His respondents were 100 American males.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendation:\\nI believe that there are legal measures that can and should be put into place that can significantly reduce the harm done to individuals during the production of pornography. (And as a result of what happened during that production.) These measures can also reduce the harm done to women, children, and society in general from the existence of, consumption of, and influence of violent, degrading, and sexist pornography. Such measures would include: restricting access of Internet pornography and other types of pornography to those who are 18 and over, raising the age of participation in pornography to 21 years old, and improving the health and safety standards of pornography production in a variety of ways, including implementing mandatory condom use.
 Global warming may be defined as the phenomenon of a gradual increase in the mean temperature of earth and ocean.  It is a result of the concentration of greenhouse gases and  carbon dioxide on the earth's atmosphere. Human action over the past century has speeded the process global warming. The unprecedented scientific and industrial advancement we made over the last century has  nature as its casualty.\\n	Global warming is a real threat facing earth and its very existence.  Global warming effects certain climatic changes affecting the balance of our nature and raising questions about its sustainability.  Climatic changes happen as result  of natural processes or it can be forced by human action.\\n	Naturally occurring gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone show green house properties and cause the warming the earth's temperature but it is a natural process and is controlled.\\n	But rapid industrialisation and thoughtless less use of resources released very high levels of the greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Certain gases like hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons are released as result of increased industrial activity and combustion of solid waste, .fossil fuels and coal.\\n	It has resulted in a phenomenon called greenhouse effect, which results in trapping the sunlight that enters the earth and not allowing them to escape the atmosphere thereby increasing the temperature.  This phenomenon will have disastrous effects on the ecological balance and different natural cycles, like the water cycle.  It can even result in melting the polar ice cap and flooding the coastal areas of the world and also habitat destruction and thereby extinction of animal and plant species. It is also sure to have a lot of other consequences that can even question the future of earth as the only living planet.\\n	 It is high time the people initiated some action against the thoughtless and unsustainable development projects. Although time is fast running out there is hope and the situation can be brought under control by reducing the release of such greenhouse gases and rapid re-forrestation. If these measures are initiated immediately and executed properly things could well be brought under control.\\nCreating awareness among people and alerting them against the ill-effects of global warming can help avoid disaster. But, what has to be done immediately is to effect law and restrictions by the governments of the countries, especially the more developed ones, to control the release of these gases.
Less Law, More Order:  The Truth about Reducing Crime proposes a federal crime bill to reduce crime, reduce taxes and invest in youth, families and neighborhoods.  Each year 24 million Americans are victims of crime. U.S. taxpayers spend more and more each year on police, prisons and judges--a record $200 billion at last count. Yet prestigious commissions show not only that this standard way of responding to crime is ineffective but that there is scientific proof that many projects that tackle risk factors that cause crime are effective. Less Law, More Order illustrates in convincing detail what needs to be done to prevent crime.  It shows that hiring public health nurses and investing in helping youth at risk to complete school and get job training is better than hiring more police; preventing family violence, banning hand guns and dealing with drugs through public health saves more lives than incarceration; getting close neighbors to watch out for us and better industrial design are more effective than criminal courts; smarter policing is better than more police; paying for services to support victims and guaranteeing them rights is better than more rhetoric. Addressing the social issues that lead to crime, rather than addressing crime after it happens, or putting stiffer penalties in place, will contribute to creating a safer society and to keeping kids and adults from taking the wrong path toward a life of crime.
People talk a lot about the weather, which is not surprising when you consider the impact it has on our mood, on how we dress and on what we eat. 'Climate' however is not the same as the weather. It is the average pattern of weather for a particular region over a long period of time.\\n\\nThe climate has and will always vary for natural reasons. Natural causes of this include fractional changes in solar radiation, volcanic eruptions that can shroud the Earth in dust which reflects the heat from the sun back into space, and natural fluctuations in the climate system itself.\\n\\nHowever, natural causes can explain only a small part of this warming. The overwhelming majority of scientists agree that it is due to rising concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere caused by human activities.\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nEnergy from the sun warms the earth's surface and, as the temperature increases, heat is radiated back into the atmosphere as infra-red energy. Some of the energy is absorbed within the atmosphere by 'greenhouse gases'.\\n\\nThe atmosphere acts in a similar way to the walls of a greenhouse, letting in the visible light and absorbing the outgoing infra-red energy, keeping it warm inside. This natural process is called the "greenhouse effect." Without it, the global average temperature on earth would be -18°C, whereas at the moment it is +15°C.\\n\\nHowever, human activities are adding greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, to the atmosphere, which are enhancing the natural greenhouse effect and making the world warmer. This man-made extra warming is called the "enhanced" greenhouse effect...................\\n\\nIts real, Be part of the mitigation process

== Climatically stable rain forest ==\\n\\nTropical lowland rain forest is highly dependent on sufficient rainfall evently distributed over the year, i.e. without a significant dry season. A critical drop in rainfall or lengthing of the dry season will cause the forest to change, gradually or dramatically depending on the severity of the change (the latter often associated with humain induced fires). A gradual change in climate causes humid rain forest to become monsoon or decidious forest and eventually it will be replaced by shrub and grassland. A dramatic change is ussually caused by fire when the dried out rain forest burns and the closed-canopy rain forest is reduced to a forest savanna mosaic(e.g. during El Nino events in Indonesia). \\n\\nThe amount and annual distribution of rainfall at the equator has varied regularly due to natural causes related to orbital forcing, continental drift and most recently due to humain socio-economic development. During periods with a drier climatic regime some of the rain forest would disapear first at the edge and progressively inward.
Global warming\\n\\nIt means the heat that is absorbed by the earth's lower surface from the sun's rays.The main greenhouse gases are:\\nwater vapor,\\ncarbon-do-oxide,\\nozone,\\nmethane.\\nThese gases do not allow all the radiations of the sun to escape from the atmosphere of the earth.This is known as the greenhouse effect.These trapped\\nradiations give heat and warmth to the earth.Over the past few years man has been cutting trees,which results in releasing millions of tons of carbon-di-oxide.\\nWater is also very good in absorbing heat.This causes the earth to become more warmer.Scientists have called this effect"Global Warming".\\n[[File:Global Warming|22px|thumbnail|left]]

\\n\\n'''Sick River Syndrome'''\\nSick River Syndrome is the stress placed on rivers and communities when human activity deteriorates the river water quality.\\nOver extraction of water for drinking and irrigation can slow or stop the current. The reduced flow helps cause salinity and stagnation. Flood plain wetlands dry up. River estuaries can become blocked preventing tidal waters entering coastal wetlands affecting marine life, water birds and mangroves.\\nMining waste, animal waste, agricultural chemicals [fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and insecticides], sewerage and urban storm water can all flow in and pollute rivers\\nCommunities reliant on the river for drinking water, irrigation, fishing and recreation are faced with an unsustainable future. Arguements and blame are cast between users, environmentalists and governments.\\n''Examples\\nThe Anglesea River in Victoria Australia. When dead fish were found floating in the river some residents blamed the near by coal mine, others blamed herbicide spraying up stream. What ever the cause, both the river and the community were stressed.\\nThe Murray Darling River System in Australia is a major example of Sick River Syndrome exasperated by an extended drought in the early 21st century.
There is no simple interpretation of what constitutes a "genetic disorder", since most aspects of human biology involve both genetic (inherited) and non-genetic (environmental) causes. Moreover, many genetic effects influence aspects of our biology that are not specifically medical in nature (height, eye color, ability to taste or smell certain compounds, etc). Also, some genetic disorders only yield a medical condition in combination with the relevant environmental factors (such as diet). With these caveats, genetic disorders typically consist of clinically defined diseases with a clearly demonstrable genetic cause. Ideally, the disorder can be associated with DNA sequence variation in a single gene. For example, cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, and is the most common recessive disorder in caucasian populations with over 1300 different mutations known[1]. Severe mutations in specific genes are relatively rare, thus genetic disorders are similarly individually rare. However, since there are many genes that can vary to cause genetic disorders, in aggregate they comprise a significant component of medical conditions, especially in pediatrics. Molecularly characterized genetic disorders are those for which the underlying causal gene has been identified, currently there are approximately 2100 such disorders annotated in the OMIM database
Meet the evolution of plastic pollution… PlasTikobots! As many of us who live near the oceans, or any body of water for that matter, know that plastic products are one of the top forms of pollution found in those areas. All of these PlasTikobots are made from that very same plastic pollution. According to the California Coastal Commission approximately 1,224,663 tons of debris was collected during California Coastal Cleanup day in 2010; a large amount of which was plastic. This debris can be harmful to many plant and animal species that live in these aquatic ecosystems. They can swallow the plastic pieces which they aren’t able to digest, or it could even choke them. In addition, the chemical compounds in the plastic can leach out into the water changing its chemistry and introducing harmful toxins. When you look closely you can actually begin to make out the different types of plastic that constitute the PlasTikobots. Each one is made from plastic products collected from a beach or near a waterway. We have made them in order to call attention to the increasing problem of plastic, and other pollution in these delicate and vital ecosystems. "PlasTikobots were created and designed by Southern California Artist, Claudio Garzon"
fAT SLOB is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health, leading to reduced life expectancy and/or increased health problems.[1][2] Body mass index (BMI), a measurement which compares weight and height, defines people as overweight (pre-obese) when their BMI is between 25 kg/m2 and 30 kg/m2, and obese when it is greater than 30 kg/m2.[3]\\nObesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, breathing difficulties during sleep, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis.[2] Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive dietary calories, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility, although a few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications or psychiatric illness. Evidence to support the view that some obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is limited; on average obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.[4][5]\\nThe primary treatment for obesity is dieting and physical exercise. To supplement this, or in case of failure, anti-obesity drugs may be taken to reduce appetite or inhibit fat absorption. In severe cases, surgery is performed or an intragastric balloon is placed to reduce stomach volume and/or bowel length, leading to earlier satiation and reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.[6][7]\\nObesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing prevalence in adults and children, and authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century.[8] Obesity is stigmatized in the modern Western world, though it has been perceived as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history, and still is in many parts of Africa.[2][9] by fat slob productions.

'''processor'''-\\nprocessor is main part of a computer processor processes all the data we give  to it and shows us output \\n\\nA different approach to improving a computer's performance is to add extra processors, as in symmetric multiprocessing designs which have been popular in servers and workstations since the early 1990s. Keeping up with Moore's Law is becoming increasingly challenging as chip-making technologies approach the physical limits of the technology.\\n\\nIn response, the microprocessor manufacturers look for other ways to improve performance, in order to hold on to the momentum of constant upgrades in the market.\\n\\nA multi-core processor is simply a single chip containing more than one microprocessor core, effectively multiplying the potential performance with the number of cores (as long as the operating system and software is designed to take advantage of more than one processor). Some components, such as bus interface and second level cache, may be shared between cores. Because the cores are physically very close they interface at much faster clock speeds compared to discrete multiprocessor systems, improving overall system performance.
Food is the primary needs of human life, and food comes from agriculture. But the science of agriculture is not the familiar territory to human. Like the sun, air, water, the most important elements of our existence, but they are also the most overlooked resources. As a result, agriculture in long history, has been operating in a rather primitive way. That makes it into a low-income and the most volatile industry. Its production is the most unpredictable. Because of this, famine is never disappeared until now since the history of mankind. In fact agriculture covers a wide and advance knowledge. Human beings should put in more effort in agricultural science and agricultural investment to make agriculture as an easy, efficient and stable industry. Ensure humans the most basic resources for survival. In particular, new trends have shown that agricultural products have been not just in food. They will be more in line with environmental or ecological balance, sustainable development, the source of new energy and new materials. How to promote agricultural development, symbiotic with natural ecosystems, should be the key topics of concern and discussion.
'''Globalization of Markets and Competition: Trade is increasingly global in scope today. There are several reasons for this. One significant reason is technological—because of improved transportation and communication opportunities today, trade is now more practical. Thus, consumers and businesses now have access to the very best products from many different countries. Increasingly rapid technology lifecycles also increases the competition among countries as to who can produce the newest in technology. In part to accommodate these realities, countries in the last several decades have taken increasing steps to promote global trade through agreements such as the General Treaty on Trade and Tariffs, and trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the European Union (EU).''Italic text'''''
Madison residents are no strangers to mercury contamination in fish, a result of the high mercury levels present in Lake Monona. However, the global extent of mercury pollution is less widely-advertised. In August, the International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant met at the Monona Terrace and ratified a declaration claiming that reducing mercury use and emissions are necessary steps to lowering the health risks associated with the element and its compounds.\\n\\n“The declaration summarizes what we know about mercury in the environment, from a wide array of expertise,” said David Krabbenhoft, a research scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey and a conference co-chair.\\n\\nMercury is an environmental pollutant that has been released in increasing amounts by manufacturers ever since the Industrial Revolution. High levels of mercury exposure in humans have been shown to have a variety of toxic effects, many of which stem from mercury’s ability to inhibit enzymes from breaking down other toxins. From damaging developing fetuses to increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, mercury’s toxic effects are felt throughout one’s lifetime.\\n\\nThe conference did not dwell purely upon the human health risk, however. The declaration covered four major topics, including sources of mercury in the atmosphere, risk to humans, fish and wildlife, recovery of mercury-contaminated fisheries and socioeconomic impacts of mercury use and pollution.\\n\\nCurrently much of the mercury pollution comes from industrial mining operations worldwide, especially those mining gold and other precious metals. Miners release mercury compounds into the air as a byproduct of modern extraction techniques, and can accumulate toxic levels of some compounds in their body, contaminating their homes and communities.\\n\\n“About 10 to 15 million miners are using about a thousand tons of mercury a year to extract gold, exposing themselves and the families to elevated concentrations of mercury vapor and contributing to about ten percent of the human load of mercury to the global environment,” said Edward Swain, a conference co-chair and research scientist at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\\n\\nOther major sources of mercury pollution include coal-fired power plants and volcanic eruptions. Mercury also leaks slowly from many kinds of thermometers and fluorescent lamps.\\n\\n“It is clear that [long-term] mercury use and environmental releases of mercury have had significant social and economic cost,” Swain said.\\n\\nAs mercury is released into the surrounding environment, it travels up the food chain. Soil absorbs mercury compounds, which are drawn into plants through their roots. Animals consume these plants and slowly develop dangerous concentrations of mercury throughout their lives. Fish can also develop high concentrations of mercury simply by absorbing the chemical while swimming in mercury-heavy waters.\\n\\nHigh levels of mercury, if present in food animals, are easily passed to humans. Humans also absorb mercury from the surrounding atmosphere through the skin.\\n\\nMercury usage and pollution is heavily linked to the economic and political fabric of our world. Within the last 30 years, mercury emissions have increased in developing nations, counteracting the progress made in decreasing mercury emissions in developed states. Developed nations often have regulatory power over the production standards, while developing nations have much lower emissions standards in order to maintain production in a harsh economic climate.\\n\\nMercury, however, does not discriminate based upon socioeconomic status. Like any other global environmental hazard, mercury affects everyone.
The mission of the INDC is to increase our understanding of the effects of common food on long term health, performance, mental and physical fitness.\\n\\nTo achieve this goal, we need to gain insight into bioactive compounds in food, how they are absorbed and metabolized in the body, taking into account the genetic and metabolic uniqueness of individuals. \\n\\nThis requires very sensitive analytical methods to determine what we really eat. The same instrumentation can be used to control quality and content of food and to analyze metabolites and nutritional biomarkers.\\n\\nWe do not eat the same bread or drink the same beer that our grandparents did hundred years ago. Agriculture and food technology have changed greatly and must be taken into account to evaluate the effect of these technologies on the nutritional value of food and its effect on human health.\\n\\nWe also have to consider the health effect of our life style; one of sitting in front of the computer, in a car or on an airplane. Our body evolved to produce chemicals to help us to survive but with an active lifestyle. The result is that, we now live in a new state of physiological stress. \\n\\nMeaningful food recommendations based on such understanding is limited. It is critical to understand what to eat and how these foods are metabolized and what molecules are produced in the human body as a reaction to stress.\\n\\nIt is the goal of INDC to bring together an understanding of the food we eat with the analytical techniques needed to study them.\\n\\nINDC2012 will be held at Carolinum, Charles University in Prague, August 27-30, 2012. \\n\\nReferences:http://www.indc.cz/en/

Green buildings consume 15% less materials, use 30% less energy, and require 40% less water than the conventional building.\\nDavid Boldini & Partners will be to build green, in turn making a significant reduction in CO2 emissions.\\nDavid Boldini is a prominent green activist and environmentalist too.              \\nFrom protecting rainforests to advocating for animals and alternative fuels, the work of David Boldini covers a variety of issues and causes.
The explosive beginning of our universe, the Big Bang marks the earliest time we can probe with current physical theory. Theory has to guide our understanding of the first fraction of a second, since we can’t recreate the extremely high temperatures that existed during the earliest history of the universe in any earthly laboratory. What theory tells us is that from an initial state in which matter and radiation are both in an extremely hot and dense form, the universe expands and the matter cools. At that time, it is believed that all four of the fundamental forces of nature—gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces—were unified.\\n\\n       The evolution of the earliest universe is not well understood because it is not clear exactly what laws were at work. However, it is known that by the end of the first second of time, the building blocks of matter had formed. By the end of the first three minutes, helium and other light nuclei (like deuterium) had formed but for a long time, temperatures remained too high for the formation of most atoms. At around one million years following the Big Bang, nuclei and electrons were at low enough temperatures to coalesce to form atoms. But the universe didn’t start to look like it does today until small perturbations in the matter distribution were able to condense to form the stars and galaxies we know today.
     There has been extensive coverage of Martin Luther King, Jr's troubles with the FBI.  As Donner's book "The Age of Surveillance" points out many other individuals and groups, integrationist and segregationist, were targeted by the FBI and other intelligence agencies.  Those targeted were subject to "agressive" intelligence.  That is actions to hinder or harm the organizations and individuals.  Such activity was so widespread that it appears to represent an official, but clandestine, policy.  This raises the possibility that the federal government or some part thereof had decided racial agitation during the Cold War could be an intolerable threat to national security.  Attempting to control racial agitation by legal action might actually increase racial animosities so clandestine action was required.  In view of the extent of this suppression of lower level racial agitators it was probably felt essential to "neutralize" Dr. King.  The same possibility occurs in the case of George Wallace.\\n     In both cases these assassinations or attempts were investigated by the federal government which may have been a party to them.  This raises more unanswered questions about these events.

Definition\\nMangrove restoration is the regeneration of mangrove forest ecosystems in areas where they have previously existed. The practice of mangrove restoration is grounded in the discipline of restoration ecology, which aims to “[assist] the recovery of resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed” (Forest Service Manual, 2000). Since environmental impacts are an ongoing threat, to successfully restore an ecosystem implies not merely to recreate its former condition, but to strengthen its capacity to adapt to change over time.\\n \\nMangrove forests, along with the animal species they shelter, represent globally significant sources of biodiversity and provide humanity with valuable ecosystem services. They are used by mammals, reptiles and migratory birds as feeding and breeding grounds, and provide crucial habitats for fish and crustacean species of commercial importance. The roots of the mangrove physically buffer shorelines from the erosive impacts of ocean waves and storms. Additionally, they protect riparian zones by absorbing floodwaters and slowing down the flow of sediment-loaded river water. This allows sediments to drop to the bottom where they are held in place, thus containing potentially toxic waste products and improving the quality of water and sanitation in coastal communities. \\n\\nTo the human communities who rely on them, mangrove forests represent local sources of sustainable income from the harvest of fish and timber, as well as non-timber forest products such as medicinal plants, palm leaves and honey. On a global scale, they have been shown to sequester carbon in quantities comparable to higher-canopy terrestrial rainforests, which means that they may play a role in mitigating climate change (Spalding, 2010), in addition to physically protecting coastlines from the projected sea-level rise associated with climate change (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). However, there are limits to the capacity of mangroves to adapt to climate change. It is projected that a 1-meter rise in sea level could inundate and destroy mangrove forests in many regions around the globe (IPCC AR4 [correct citation?]), which would leave coastal communities vulnerable to the risks of flooding, shoreline erosion, saline intrusion and increased storm activity (Field, 1995). \\n\\n2. Mangrove loss and degradation \\nThe issue of restoration is critical today since mangrove forests are being lost very quickly – at an even faster rate than tropical rainforests inland (Duke et al., 2007). A recent estimate puts the total mangrove area worldwide in 2005 at 152,000 km2 – down from 188,000 km2 in 1980 (Food and Agriculture Organization Report, 2007). In other words some 36,000 km2, or nearly 20% of the world’s mangroves, were lost over a period of twenty-five years. Other estimates of loss may differ due to having been drawn from a smaller pool of data. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment estimates the total loss worldwide at 35% between 1980 and 2000, but this result was drawn from data on only slightly more than half of the total mangrove area (MA, 2005). Much of this lost mangrove area was destroyed to make room for industry, housing and tourism development; for aquaculture, primarily shrimp farms; and for agriculture, such as rice paddies, livestock pasture and salt production (FAO, 2007). Other drivers of mangrove forest destruction include activities that divert their sources of freshwater, such as groundwater withdrawals, the building of dams, and the building of roads and drainage canals across tidal flats.\\n\\n3. Mangrove restoration \\nMangroves are sensitive ecosystems, changing dynamically in response to storms, sediment blockage, and fluctuations in sea level (Field, 1998) and present a “moving target” for restoration efforts. Different restoration approaches face this challenge in different ways. The most common method simply consists in planting stands of a single species of mangrove on mudflats, or other areas thought to be suitable, without consideration of whether or not they supported mangroves in the past. This approach usually fails over the long term because the underlying soil and hydrological requirements of the mangroves are not being met. More informed methods aim to bring a damaged mangrove area back into its preexisting condition, taking into account not only ecosystem factors but also social, cultural and political perspectives (Field, 1998). These approaches begin with the understanding that a damaged mangrove area may be able to repair itself through the natural processes of secondary succession, without being physically planted, provided that its tidal and freshwater hydrology is functioning normally and there is an adequate supply of seedlings (Lewis, 2005, 2009a, 2009b). Taking this into account, it becomes crucial to the success of a restoration project to evaluate what the hydrology of a disturbed mangrove site should look like under normal conditions, and the ways in which it has been modified.\\n\\nAn exemplar of this approach is the Ecological Mangrove Restoration method (Lewis, 2005, 2009a, 2009b) which recommends the following steps, to be undertaken using healthy mangroves of the surrounding area as a reference: 1) assess the ecology, especially reproduction and distribution patterns, of the mangrove species at the disturbed site; 2) map the topographical elevations and hydrological patterns that determine how seedlings should establish themselves at the site; 3) assess the changes made to the site that currently prevent the site from recovering by itself; 4) design a restoration plan that begins by restoring the normal range of elevations and tidal hydrology at the site; and 5) monitor the site to determine if the restoration has been successful in light of the original objectives. The actual planting of seedlings is a last resort, since it fails in many cases (Lewis, 2005); it should be considered only if natural recruitment of seedlings fails to reach the restoration objective. \\n\\n4. Additional considerations\\nAn important but often overlooked aspect of mangrove restoration efforts is the role that the local communities play as stakeholders in the process and the outcome. Since they may directly feel the effects of restoration projects, they should be involved in the process as much as feasibly possible, from decision-making to maintenance over the long term. Their involvement and local knowledge, as well as collaboration with other stakeholders such as sponsors and governing agencies, is crucial to the success of restoration projects.\\n\\n5. Limitations\\nIn some areas, restoration may be prohibitively difficult due to the degradation of the soil that regularly follows the clear-cutting of mangrove forests. Common effects include advanced erosion of the soil, loss of nutrients, high levels of salinity, and/or buildup of toxins (Field, 1998). However, even without this extent of degradation, the soil may be come unable to host plant life at all due to the loss of the live mangrove roots, which exuded oxygen and carbohydrate into the soil and maintained its quality. \\n\\nUsing foresight early in the restoration process to carefully select sites that are likely to succeed as self-maintaining ecosystems, as well as ensuring that proper management is built into the conservation effort, can prevent the waste of time and energy that often accompanies restoration projects. The long-lasting aftereffects of mangrove degradation underscore the importance of eliminating its causes, since once sites are cleared, they may never completely recover. \\n\\n6.

In recent years many of the world leading ancient wonders preservators have published that the modern environment has a large impact on these historic buildings and sites.\\nOne of the latest discoveries in this field states that ultraviolet radiation(UVR) has a large impact on the material from which these buildings are built.\\nThe material itself may be imune to such things at first, but being exsposed to it for such a long time surely takes it toll, not to mention that time itself slowly degrades all materials on Earth.\\nIn these statments the leading researchers say that UVR seems to influence the bonds between atoms and molecules, and with this making the material(in this case rock) much less durable than usually.\\nSuch cases were found in Egypt(Pyramids), Rome(Coliseum)and almost all other locations where there are hot and dry summers(deserts, mediterainian climate).
=== Understanding Climate Change ===\\n{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n\\nContents\\n\\n    1. Introduction to Climate Change\\n    2. Cause of Climate Change\\n    3. Proof of Climate Change\\n    4. Solutions to Climate Change\\n    5. Overview\\n   \\n\\n\\n1. Governments and scientists alike have agreed that climate change is real and serious. It is a major environmental issue that affects many aspects of today’s society and will affect everyone in the future. Climate change is not a new matter although numerous plans have been implemented recently to accommodate this important issue, particularly in Australia. The continuation of greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere naturally and unnaturally, contributes to the global warming of the planet which causes severe problems which society will have to deal with in generations to come. Not only will we as a society have to look into using cleaner forms of energy, but also sustainable energy that can accommodate the worlds requirements as we expand globally. \\n\\n[[File:Vegetation Induced Circular Snowmelt.jpg|thumb|right|Melted Snow due to the effects of global warming ]]\\n\\n2. There is overwhelming evidence that our climate is changing due to human activities and through natural processes which is unequivocal. One of the main factors that contribute to our climate change in recent years is the increase of greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere, trapping the ultraviolet rays produced by the sun in the earth’s atmosphere and slowly heating the planet. These greenhouse gases are composed of a variety of gases that can absorb and emit infrared radiation such as: carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide and are released mainly through the burning and consumption of fossil fuels. These fossil fuels are what drive the majority of the electrical and motorised power that we use today, from lighting to vehicles to massive industrial power stations and are the main sources of the world’s power. Although, this damaging power comes at a cost, where the environment we live in suffers whilst society continues to use more and more, disregarding the potential threats and problems that are sure to follow with this costly system of living.\\n\\n\\n3. Climate change is the variation in the average pattern of weather over a long period of time. It is generally referred to as ‘global warming’ as all of the earth’s entities are gradually heated by the trapped ultraviolet rays in the atmosphere. This alteration in the weather causes countless problems for the earth’s environment and all living things. The evidence is clear, the increase of global average air, ocean and land temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and the rising of sea levels globally. This causes many detrimental effects for the environments ecosystems and for the animals living in them, for example, the melting of the polar ice caps that are home to polar bears makes it extremely difficult for them to live and thrive as much of their home has been dissolved. Everyone and everything is affected by climate change even on a local level, in Darwin, Australia the rainfall in certain areas has caused major flooding in some low-lying parts, this occurs at high tide when the creeks overflow, although only recently has the flooding occurred due to the rising sea levels. The flooding ruined many houses in the area, blocking roads and caused thousands of dollars’ worth of damages and this is only the beginning. If the greenhouse gases continue to be released into the atmosphere to instigate these chains of events, the disasters in the future will be a lot worse and potentially life-threatening.\\n\\n4. Climate change can be minimised and it is possible to contribute positively to the reduction of greenhouse gases and therefore global warming. Much of the damage afflicted to our planet over the years is irreversible, although there are countless methods and solutions to help save our earth from early catastrophe.  Organizations like ‘Greenpeace’ have numerous ways to protect the environment and work towards sustainable lifestyles that aren’t harmful to the environment.  Some methods that can be incorporated on a large scale is the use of energy-efficient light bulbs which save power by using less current, this has proven to be successful as it reduces the amount of power needed to produce light and therefore less fossil fuels are consumed and less greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. Renewable energy sources such as solar power, wind power and tidal power are also ways to help reduce the emissions produced by using them as alternative energy sources. Other methods that the Australian government have implemented to reduce greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere by large industries is the clean energy bill. The Australian government proposed the clean energy bill in a bid to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and limit global warming by forcing businesses to pay $23 per tonne of CO2 emissions which will pressure large businesses into finding alternative fuel sources that are renewable. Through innovation and creativity, society can find various forms of alternative energy that does not harm our environment and restore it so that the inhabitants of the ecosystems can thrive.\\n\\n5. Global warming also referred to as climate change in the modern society has a large impact on all living things on the planet. The effects of these changes in weather can cause major disruptions in ecosystems potentially destroying habitats of animals and their environment that is irreplaceable. Many solutions are available to help reduce the ever increasing global warming and work towards a cleaner, greener society.
\\n===Earthquake===\\n\\nAn [[earthquake]] is a [[phenomenon]] that results from a sudden release of stored energy that radiates [[seismic wave]]s. At the [[Earth]]'s surface, earthquakes may manifest themselves by a shaking or displacement of the ground and sometimes [[tsunamis]]. Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000-km-long, horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, also known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part bounds the [[Pacific Plate]]. Many earthquakes happen each day, few of which are large enough to cause significant damage.\\n                                                                                                                                                                              \\n  THREE CAUSES OF AN EARTHQUAKES ARE :\\n  There are three main types of fault that may cause an earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip.(1) Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended.(2) Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened.(3) Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other.\\n\\n  THREE EFFECTS OF AN EARTHQUAKE ARE :\\n\\n   (1) This includes damage to buildings and in worst cases the loss of human life.(2)The effects of the rumbling produced by earthquakes usually leads to the destruction of structures such as buildings, bridges, and dams.(3)They can also trigger landslides.
EDUCATION IN COSTA RICA.\\n\\nIn what used to be a poverty-stricken rural backwater, it is understandable that the country's high standards of schooling are a source of enormous national pride. With foregone military budgets funding the massive education system, the only armies these days are hordes of neatly-uniformed schoolchildren on their way to and from school-one of the most ubiquitous images of Costa Rica.\\n\\nEducation is seen as the means to income (salaries are determined by academic level)and status-everyone wants to be cultured. As nearly every job, however menial, requires a high-school education, many adults study at evening classes or through distance learning, choosing from the huge array of courses available.\\n\\nWhile the level of education in Costa Rica is clearly high for the region, and one of the reasons why the country is so popular with foreign business investors in Costa Rica real estate, it seems that a good education is increasingly becoming an issue of wealth.
Viral Influenza Shedding:  It appears that reliable information about viral shedding of Influenza A in general and the current H1N1 "Swine Flu" epidemic is not readily available. In order to rationally recommend quarantine of affected individuals in schools, work sites or other closed communities, it is necessary to know the rate at which affected individuals become less contagious to others. This page is intended to attract commentary from knowledgeable contributors about how rapidly  H1N1 infected individuals can be returned to their communities without unduly risking their colleagues. Although current public health policy recommends isolation from 5 to 10 days after the apparent onset of illness, the scientific basis for this recommendation seems obscure beyond experiments involving artificial viral infection with vaccination strains.
In business, reducing operations to the bare minimum required to continue serving existing business; colloquially, the least necessary to 'keep the lights on'. It emphasizes only those functions needed to continue serving the firm's customers and slows/halts/cancels all other operations (research, development, hiring, promotions and non-salary compensation, capital improvements, etc.)\\n\\nDuring bad economic times, the progression of operations to a lights-on mode typically takes place over several weeks or months of cutbacks, project cancellations and layoffs. \\n\\nThe term also applies to much faster-developing situations, such as a disaster, pandemic or other event that renders large portions of the workforce or infrastructure unable to function. \\n\\nAt larger firms, this mode is part of formal Operational Plan under a variety of names ('Run the Firm', 'Reduced-overhead', etc.)  The Plan is used as a tool to catgeorize projects, assets and infrastructure as part of normal operations. While this is usually to help plan for rapid-onset crises, the same designations eventually apply to a slow-moving economic downturn. \\n\\nSmaller firms usually do not have such formal plans, instead relying on management to designate key people and projects.

The results indicate that trauma is caused by the consequence of young people becoming homeless, and the lives of these men and women should be understood. Other causes for homelessness are issues from people living in poverty, lack of employment, houses being too expensive, gentrification and violence. All of these reasons is why people are now becoming homeless at young ages. \\n\\nYoung children are becoming homeless as well. There are major risks for homeless children, such as poor health care, not having a good well-being and having bad social outcomes. These children are exposed to a very stressful life style, they witness a lot of domestic violence, mental health difficulties and most likely to come from a broken home. In about every 200 children in America, 3 will become homeless today and more then double of that will be at risk for homelessness. School is impacted by homelessness, because of residency requirements, guardianship requirements, delays in transfer of school credits, use of transportation and lack of health resources. Even the children who still attend school that are homeless, have a low attendance record.\\n\\nThere have been alliances that organizations have created to end homelessness. There are studies and estimations that have been made to figure out how many individuals today are homeless. There are strategies that are listed about how to end it and ways to gain more knowledge on the topic as well.
I'm an Astronomy Masters student with a particular interest in terraforming and space colonisation. I wholeheartedly believe that there's an urgent need to solve humanity's problems by making clear advancements in space discovery and colonisation. We need, now more than ever, to start thinking in bigger terms and move on from our earth-bound, earth-centric view. With thousands of years of progress already under our belts, now's the time to step up and take ourselves to the next level. Creative solutions to pressing problems are urgently required! Advancements will only come from more research and hence from greater funding. And that will only come about if there is a groundswell of understanding and support significant enough to shift the political and economic agenda.
Africa Mission Alliance (AMA) is a faith-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Portland, Oregon with subsidiaries in East and Central Africa. The work of AMA began in the country of Rwanda in 2003 as a few individuals dedicated to caring for orphans, widows and the needy in this genocide ravaged country. AMA’s dream is to reach beyond Rwanda into all of Africa and see a new generation of Africans becoming change agents in their vulnerable communities. \\nThe mission of Africa Mission Alliance is to bring professional and general public resources together for the purposes of training, equipping, and supporting local communities in Africa to develop self-sustaining, community-based approaches to solving their problems.\\n\\nAMA believes that the people of Africa do not want to live on handouts. They need help to discover and use their own vision, skills, and resources to achieve self-sufficiency. Africa Mission Alliance is committed to walking and working with communities in Africa by empowering them to build sustainable communities. The larger vision is to address critical needs that hinder development by helping communities receive quality education, skills training, basic health care, access to clean water, and micro-finance loans
contingency plan\\n\\nA contingency plan is a plan devised for an exceptional risk that, though unlikely, would have catastrophic consequences. Contingency plans are often devised by governments or businesses. For example, suppose many employees of a company are traveling together on an aircraft which crashes, killing all aboard. The company could be severely strained or even ruined by such a loss. Accordingly, many companies have procedures to follow in the event of such a disaster. The plan may also include standing policies to mitigate a disaster's potential impact, such as requiring employees to travel separately or limiting the number of employees on any one aircraft.\\n\\nDuring times of crisis, contingency plans are often developed to explore and prepare for any eventualit
Is the Kyoto Protocol heading toward (or does it already contain) provisions for emissions trading or a [[cap and trade]] program?\\n\\nWill nations such as India and China which won't be bound by the protocol, nevertheless participate in a trading program? That is, will they get tens of billions of dollars from the industrialized West (US and Europe) simply for doing nothing?\\n\\nIf global warming is caused by sunspots more than carbon dioxide, and the average atmosphure temperatures levels off at 1.0C to 1.5C higher than the 2000 level, won't the whole thing have amounted to nothing more than an international welfare program for countries with anti-free-market economic policies?\\n\\nI worry about this sort of thing, you know.\\n\\n[[user:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]], Wednesday, June 12, 2002
'''Psoriasis''' is an auto-immune disease with symptoms of red, itchy, scaly, and inflamed. Most suffers typically treat themselves with over-the-counter treatments and prescribed medications. Many negative side effects are attributed to the use of prescribed medications.\\n\\nFor years the herbal treatments for the reduction of psoriasis symptoms have been largely ignored by mainstream physicians. Many health food stores and alternative practitioners are embracing the use of herbs in their stores, practices, and suggestive selling.\\n\\nOne of the trend setters in this arena is a small company out of Tampa, FL., SielosRx. Their use of organic herbs in a cleansing and soothing regimen has caught the eye of local Dermatologist, Dr. Francis Caban. He sees people who have normally received limited results with traditional medications obtain surprising results within weeks of using nothing more than the organic herbs in these products.\\n\\nDr. Caban insists the results are genuine and has offered SielosRx to his clients when they are considering treatment options. He is firm in his belief that psoriasis suffers can choose how they reduce the symptoms of their disease. They no longer have to just suffer or take the medications that have potentially harmful side effects.
<blockquote>\\nThe Earth Sciences (also known as geoscience, the geosciences or Earth Science) is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth. It is a special type of planetary science; it studies the planet we live on: the structure and composition of the Earth, its origins, physical features, changing aspects, and all of its natural phenomena. The major disciplines of The Earth Sciences use physics, mathematics and, chemistry to build a quantitative understanding of the principal areas or spheres of the Earth system. Like in many sciences, The Earth can be studied both experimentally and theoretically. Also, there are both reductionist and holistic approaches to Earth Science. Applications of the Earth Sciences include the exploration and exploitation of mineral and hydrocarbon resources, cartography, weather forecasting patterns, and warning of volcanic eruptions. The Earth Sciences are related to the environmental sciences as well as the other subfields of planetary astronomy.\\n</blockquote>

The same instrumentation can be used to control quality and content of food and to analyze metabolites and nutritional biomarkers.\\n\\nWe do not eat the same bread or drink the same beer that our grandparents did hundred years ago. Agriculture and food technology have changed greatly and must be taken into account to evaluate the effect of these technologies on the nutritional value of food and its effect on human health.\\n\\nWe also have to consider the health effect of our life style; one of sitting in front of the computer, in a car or on an airplane. Our body evolved to produce chemicals to help us to survive but with an active lifestyle. The result is that, we now live in a new state of physiological stress.\\n\\nMeaningful food recommendations based on such understanding is limited. It is critical to understand what to eat and how these foods are metabolized and what molecules are produced in the human body as a reaction to stress.\\n\\nIt is the goal of INDC to bring together an understanding of the food we eat with the analytical techniques needed to study them.\\n\\nINDC2012 will be held at Carolinum, Charles University in Prague, August 27-30, 2012.\\n\\nReferences:http://www.indc.cz/en/
\\n'''Reasons For Unemployment in Kerala'''\\n\\nIt is interesting to know that the State with the highest literacy rate — almost 97 per cent — has the highest unemployment rate when compared to others. Kerala is known for large-scale migration of skilled labour to other States and countries. \\n\\nA few millions of people of the State have been working outside it for many years. Had they remained in Kerala, the unemployment rate would have been much higher than what was quoted in the article. \\n\\nWhat ails the State that has such a high literacy rate and is also blessed by vast natural resources? \\n\\nDoes the education system make people lethargic or rights-conscious or inefficient or unenterprising to start productive activities for their own progress? Does the education system make people more destructive in nature? \\n\\nNo industrialist wants to set up any industry in Kerala due to labour problems. The State is bankrupt, besides being corrupt and largely politicised. Trade unionism is still alive in Kerala. West Bengal was industrially ruined by the same attitude of the workers despite a highly skilled labour force. \\n\\nInstead of migrating to other States for jobs, Keralites should use their knowledge and expertise in establishing new productive activity on their own. Many of them should look at self-employment for overcoming the serious problem of unemployment.
