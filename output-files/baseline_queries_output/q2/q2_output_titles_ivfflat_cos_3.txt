\\n \\nGraphical description of risks and impacts from global warming from the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\nThe predicted effects of global warming on the environment and for human life are numerous and varied. It is generally difficult to attribute specific natural phenomena to long-term causes, but some effects of recent climate change may already be occurring. Raising sea levels, glacier retreat, Arctic shrinkage, and altered patterns of agriculture are cited as direct consequences, but predictions for secondary and regional effects include extreme weather events, an expansion of tropical diseases, changes in the timing of seasonal patterns in ecosystems, and drastic economic impact. Concerns have led to political activism advocating proposals to mitigate, eliminate, or adapt to it.\\nThe 2007 Fourth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) includes a summary of the expected effects.\\n\\n Global warming is responsible in part for some trends in natural disasters such as extreme weather\\n\\nLewis Glacier, North Cascades, WA USA is one of five glaciers in the area that melted away \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\nRetreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland
                                          Rocks And Minerals\\n\\nWhat are rocks?\\n\\nMaking up the majority of the Earth's crust, rock is usually defined as a mixture of common minerals. Rocks can be hard or soft, as small as a grain or as large as a building. They have been an integral part of the history of mankind, first being used as tools for hunting and defense, and as a building materials to construct shelters and monuments. Combined with the effects of tectonics, weathering and vegetation, rocks define the natural landscapes we see around us. The minerals and metals we find in rocks are essential to the prosperity and cultural splendor of human civilization. There are many kinds of rock, and they can be classified in a number of ways. However, geologists classify rocks based on how the rocks were formed. The three classes are igneous rocks (formed directly from liquid rock), metamorphic rocks (formed by direct alteration of existing rocks), and sedimentary rocks (formed by eroded materials from other rocks).
Home to millions of species,[11] including humans, Earth is the only place in the universe where life is known to exist. The planet formed 4.54 billion years ago,[12][13][14][15] and life appeared on its surface within a billion years. Since then, Earth's biosphere has significantly altered the atmosphere and other abiotic conditions on the planet, enabling the proliferation of aerobic organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which, together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks harmful radiation, permitting life on land.[16] The physical properties of the Earth, as well as its geological history and orbit, allowed life to persist during this period. The world is expected to continue supporting life for another 1.5 billion years, after which the rising luminosity of the Sun will eliminate the biosphere.[17]\\n\\nEarth's outer surface is divided into several rigid segments, or tectonic plates, that gradually migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of the surface is covered with salt-water oceans, the remainder consisting of continents and islands; liquid water, necessary for all known life, is not known to exist on any other planet's surface.[note 4][note 5] Earth's interior remains active, with a thick layer of relatively solid mantle, a liquid outer core that generates a magnetic field, and a solid iron inner core
Direct carbon conversion units could be used to generate electric power for the grid. Such a power plant would be "large, but not gigantic." Advanced combustion, fuel cells, nuclear and renewable energy, and conservation may all combine to help the situation in a way that cannot presently be predicted.It is vitally important to develop a simple fuel cell technology that greatly increases the yield of electric energy from each unit of fossil fuel, uses fuels derived efficiently from almost any fossil fuel, significantly decreases the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, and makes it easy to capture the carbon dioxide for sequestration or other use.Clearly, we’re just beginning to hear about direct carbon conversion.
Nanotechnology (sometimes shortened to "nano tech") is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale. Generally, nanotechnology works with materials, devices, and other structures with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. Quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale. With a variety of potential applications, nanotechnology is a key technology for the future and governments have invested billions of dollars in its research. Through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars. The European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars.[1]\\n\\nNanotechnology is very diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale. Nanotechnology entails the application of fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, micro fabrication, etc.\\n\\nScientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in medicine, electronics, bio materials and energy production. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nano-materials,[2] and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.

'''Rain Forest and Carbon\\n'''\\n\\nA hectare of mature rain forest (already containing 200 tonnes of carbon as stock) can absorb an extra 6 tonnes of carbon a year, negating the belief that mature forests are at 'equilibrium' and lose their capacity as a sink at maturity. \\n\\nTropical forests act as a stock of a significant amount of carbon (containing over 430 Gt or million tonnes carbon globally), whilst capacity to act as a carbon sink can absorb over third of fossil fuel combustion and cement production each year . \\n\\nAnnual Carbon emissions due to deforestation in south-east Asia equal almost half the total annual carbon emitted from fossil fuel combustion  \\n\\nMost areas of Southern American rain forests act as sinks (although some areas are sources), with the total uptake of carbon = 0.5 Gt per year. However, CO2 is produced from the banks of the Amazon River, from the decomposition of litter, which may provide a reconciliation (and balance) of figures from the annual amount absorbed by the Amazon Basin as a whole.  \\n\\nPrevention of deforestation would not only reduce carbon emissions, as well as avoiding the huge emissions caused by clearance and safe-guarding the absorption capabilities of the tropical biosphere. \\n\\nManaging the biosphere effectively could contribute to mitigating climate change in the short term, through afforestation and the prevention of deforestation.\\n\\nhttp://www.netbot.org
A tsunami (pronounced /(t)suːˈnɑːmi/) is a series of waves created when a body of water, such as an ocean, is rapidly displaced. Earthquakes, mass movements above or below water, some volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions, landslides, underwater earthquakes, large asteroid impacts and testing with nuclear weapons at sea all have the potential to generate a tsunami. The effects of a tsunami can be devastating due to the immense volumes of water and energy involved. Since meteorites are small, they will not generate a tsunami.\\n\\nThe Greek historian Thucydides was the first to relate tsunamis to submarine quakes,[1] [2] but understanding of the nature of tsunamis remained slim until the 20th century and is the subject of ongoing research.\\n\\nMany early geological, geographic, oceanographic etc; texts refer to "Seismic sea waves" - these are now referred to as "tsunami."\\n\\nSome meteorological storm conditions - deep depressions causing cyclones, hurricanes; can generate a storm surge which can be several metres above normal tide levels. This is due to the low atmospheric pressure within the centre of the depression. As these storm surges come ashore the surge can resemble a tsunami, inundating vast areas of land. These are not tsunami. Such a storm surge inundated Burma (Myanmar) in May 20</nowiki>
By Martin F. Downs\\n\\n           In November 2004, a panel of experts testified before a Senate subcommittee that a pornographic products which millions of Americans consume is dangerously addictive. They were talking about pornography.The effects of porn on the brain were called "toxic" and compared to cocaine. One psychologist, Geryy Magera claimed "prolonged exposure to pornography stimulates a preference for depictions of group sex, sadomasochistic practices, and sexual contact with animals." His respondents were 100 American males.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendation:\\nI believe that there are legal measures that can and should be put into place that can significantly reduce the harm done to individuals during the production of pornography. (And as a result of what happened during that production.) These measures can also reduce the harm done to women, children, and society in general from the existence of, consumption of, and influence of violent, degrading, and sexist pornography. Such measures would include: restricting access of Internet pornography and other types of pornography to those who are 18 and over, raising the age of participation in pornography to 21 years old, and improving the health and safety standards of pornography production in a variety of ways, including implementing mandatory condom use.
 Global warming may be defined as the phenomenon of a gradual increase in the mean temperature of earth and ocean.  It is a result of the concentration of greenhouse gases and  carbon dioxide on the earth's atmosphere. Human action over the past century has speeded the process global warming. The unprecedented scientific and industrial advancement we made over the last century has  nature as its casualty.\\n	Global warming is a real threat facing earth and its very existence.  Global warming effects certain climatic changes affecting the balance of our nature and raising questions about its sustainability.  Climatic changes happen as result  of natural processes or it can be forced by human action.\\n	Naturally occurring gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone show green house properties and cause the warming the earth's temperature but it is a natural process and is controlled.\\n	But rapid industrialisation and thoughtless less use of resources released very high levels of the greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Certain gases like hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons are released as result of increased industrial activity and combustion of solid waste, .fossil fuels and coal.\\n	It has resulted in a phenomenon called greenhouse effect, which results in trapping the sunlight that enters the earth and not allowing them to escape the atmosphere thereby increasing the temperature.  This phenomenon will have disastrous effects on the ecological balance and different natural cycles, like the water cycle.  It can even result in melting the polar ice cap and flooding the coastal areas of the world and also habitat destruction and thereby extinction of animal and plant species. It is also sure to have a lot of other consequences that can even question the future of earth as the only living planet.\\n	 It is high time the people initiated some action against the thoughtless and unsustainable development projects. Although time is fast running out there is hope and the situation can be brought under control by reducing the release of such greenhouse gases and rapid re-forrestation. If these measures are initiated immediately and executed properly things could well be brought under control.\\nCreating awareness among people and alerting them against the ill-effects of global warming can help avoid disaster. But, what has to be done immediately is to effect law and restrictions by the governments of the countries, especially the more developed ones, to control the release of these gases.
Less Law, More Order:  The Truth about Reducing Crime proposes a federal crime bill to reduce crime, reduce taxes and invest in youth, families and neighborhoods.  Each year 24 million Americans are victims of crime. U.S. taxpayers spend more and more each year on police, prisons and judges--a record $200 billion at last count. Yet prestigious commissions show not only that this standard way of responding to crime is ineffective but that there is scientific proof that many projects that tackle risk factors that cause crime are effective. Less Law, More Order illustrates in convincing detail what needs to be done to prevent crime.  It shows that hiring public health nurses and investing in helping youth at risk to complete school and get job training is better than hiring more police; preventing family violence, banning hand guns and dealing with drugs through public health saves more lives than incarceration; getting close neighbors to watch out for us and better industrial design are more effective than criminal courts; smarter policing is better than more police; paying for services to support victims and guaranteeing them rights is better than more rhetoric. Addressing the social issues that lead to crime, rather than addressing crime after it happens, or putting stiffer penalties in place, will contribute to creating a safer society and to keeping kids and adults from taking the wrong path toward a life of crime.
People talk a lot about the weather, which is not surprising when you consider the impact it has on our mood, on how we dress and on what we eat. 'Climate' however is not the same as the weather. It is the average pattern of weather for a particular region over a long period of time.\\n\\nThe climate has and will always vary for natural reasons. Natural causes of this include fractional changes in solar radiation, volcanic eruptions that can shroud the Earth in dust which reflects the heat from the sun back into space, and natural fluctuations in the climate system itself.\\n\\nHowever, natural causes can explain only a small part of this warming. The overwhelming majority of scientists agree that it is due to rising concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere caused by human activities.\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nEnergy from the sun warms the earth's surface and, as the temperature increases, heat is radiated back into the atmosphere as infra-red energy. Some of the energy is absorbed within the atmosphere by 'greenhouse gases'.\\n\\nThe atmosphere acts in a similar way to the walls of a greenhouse, letting in the visible light and absorbing the outgoing infra-red energy, keeping it warm inside. This natural process is called the "greenhouse effect." Without it, the global average temperature on earth would be -18°C, whereas at the moment it is +15°C.\\n\\nHowever, human activities are adding greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, to the atmosphere, which are enhancing the natural greenhouse effect and making the world warmer. This man-made extra warming is called the "enhanced" greenhouse effect...................\\n\\nIts real, Be part of the mitigation process

== Climatically stable rain forest ==\\n\\nTropical lowland rain forest is highly dependent on sufficient rainfall evently distributed over the year, i.e. without a significant dry season. A critical drop in rainfall or lengthing of the dry season will cause the forest to change, gradually or dramatically depending on the severity of the change (the latter often associated with humain induced fires). A gradual change in climate causes humid rain forest to become monsoon or decidious forest and eventually it will be replaced by shrub and grassland. A dramatic change is ussually caused by fire when the dried out rain forest burns and the closed-canopy rain forest is reduced to a forest savanna mosaic(e.g. during El Nino events in Indonesia). \\n\\nThe amount and annual distribution of rainfall at the equator has varied regularly due to natural causes related to orbital forcing, continental drift and most recently due to humain socio-economic development. During periods with a drier climatic regime some of the rain forest would disapear first at the edge and progressively inward.
Global warming\\n\\nIt means the heat that is absorbed by the earth's lower surface from the sun's rays.The main greenhouse gases are:\\nwater vapor,\\ncarbon-do-oxide,\\nozone,\\nmethane.\\nThese gases do not allow all the radiations of the sun to escape from the atmosphere of the earth.This is known as the greenhouse effect.These trapped\\nradiations give heat and warmth to the earth.Over the past few years man has been cutting trees,which results in releasing millions of tons of carbon-di-oxide.\\nWater is also very good in absorbing heat.This causes the earth to become more warmer.Scientists have called this effect"Global Warming".\\n[[File:Global Warming|22px|thumbnail|left]]
Air pollution is the introduction of chemicals, particulate matter, or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to humans or other living organisms, or cause damage to the natural environment or built environment, into the atmosphere.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is a complex dynamic natural gaseous system that is essential to support life on planet Earth. Stratospheric ozone depletion due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the Earth's ecosystems.\\n\\nIndoor air pollution and urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report.[1]{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->
\\n\\n'''Sick River Syndrome'''\\nSick River Syndrome is the stress placed on rivers and communities when human activity deteriorates the river water quality.\\nOver extraction of water for drinking and irrigation can slow or stop the current. The reduced flow helps cause salinity and stagnation. Flood plain wetlands dry up. River estuaries can become blocked preventing tidal waters entering coastal wetlands affecting marine life, water birds and mangroves.\\nMining waste, animal waste, agricultural chemicals [fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and insecticides], sewerage and urban storm water can all flow in and pollute rivers\\nCommunities reliant on the river for drinking water, irrigation, fishing and recreation are faced with an unsustainable future. Arguements and blame are cast between users, environmentalists and governments.\\n''Examples\\nThe Anglesea River in Victoria Australia. When dead fish were found floating in the river some residents blamed the near by coal mine, others blamed herbicide spraying up stream. What ever the cause, both the river and the community were stressed.\\nThe Murray Darling River System in Australia is a major example of Sick River Syndrome exasperated by an extended drought in the early 21st century.
There is no simple interpretation of what constitutes a "genetic disorder", since most aspects of human biology involve both genetic (inherited) and non-genetic (environmental) causes. Moreover, many genetic effects influence aspects of our biology that are not specifically medical in nature (height, eye color, ability to taste or smell certain compounds, etc). Also, some genetic disorders only yield a medical condition in combination with the relevant environmental factors (such as diet). With these caveats, genetic disorders typically consist of clinically defined diseases with a clearly demonstrable genetic cause. Ideally, the disorder can be associated with DNA sequence variation in a single gene. For example, cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, and is the most common recessive disorder in caucasian populations with over 1300 different mutations known[1]. Severe mutations in specific genes are relatively rare, thus genetic disorders are similarly individually rare. However, since there are many genes that can vary to cause genetic disorders, in aggregate they comprise a significant component of medical conditions, especially in pediatrics. Molecularly characterized genetic disorders are those for which the underlying causal gene has been identified, currently there are approximately 2100 such disorders annotated in the OMIM database
Meet the evolution of plastic pollution… PlasTikobots! As many of us who live near the oceans, or any body of water for that matter, know that plastic products are one of the top forms of pollution found in those areas. All of these PlasTikobots are made from that very same plastic pollution. According to the California Coastal Commission approximately 1,224,663 tons of debris was collected during California Coastal Cleanup day in 2010; a large amount of which was plastic. This debris can be harmful to many plant and animal species that live in these aquatic ecosystems. They can swallow the plastic pieces which they aren’t able to digest, or it could even choke them. In addition, the chemical compounds in the plastic can leach out into the water changing its chemistry and introducing harmful toxins. When you look closely you can actually begin to make out the different types of plastic that constitute the PlasTikobots. Each one is made from plastic products collected from a beach or near a waterway. We have made them in order to call attention to the increasing problem of plastic, and other pollution in these delicate and vital ecosystems. "PlasTikobots were created and designed by Southern California Artist, Claudio Garzon"
fAT SLOB is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health, leading to reduced life expectancy and/or increased health problems.[1][2] Body mass index (BMI), a measurement which compares weight and height, defines people as overweight (pre-obese) when their BMI is between 25 kg/m2 and 30 kg/m2, and obese when it is greater than 30 kg/m2.[3]\\nObesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, breathing difficulties during sleep, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis.[2] Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive dietary calories, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility, although a few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications or psychiatric illness. Evidence to support the view that some obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is limited; on average obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.[4][5]\\nThe primary treatment for obesity is dieting and physical exercise. To supplement this, or in case of failure, anti-obesity drugs may be taken to reduce appetite or inhibit fat absorption. In severe cases, surgery is performed or an intragastric balloon is placed to reduce stomach volume and/or bowel length, leading to earlier satiation and reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.[6][7]\\nObesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing prevalence in adults and children, and authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century.[8] Obesity is stigmatized in the modern Western world, though it has been perceived as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history, and still is in many parts of Africa.[2][9] by fat slob productions.

'''processor'''-\\nprocessor is main part of a computer processor processes all the data we give  to it and shows us output \\n\\nA different approach to improving a computer's performance is to add extra processors, as in symmetric multiprocessing designs which have been popular in servers and workstations since the early 1990s. Keeping up with Moore's Law is becoming increasingly challenging as chip-making technologies approach the physical limits of the technology.\\n\\nIn response, the microprocessor manufacturers look for other ways to improve performance, in order to hold on to the momentum of constant upgrades in the market.\\n\\nA multi-core processor is simply a single chip containing more than one microprocessor core, effectively multiplying the potential performance with the number of cores (as long as the operating system and software is designed to take advantage of more than one processor). Some components, such as bus interface and second level cache, may be shared between cores. Because the cores are physically very close they interface at much faster clock speeds compared to discrete multiprocessor systems, improving overall system performance.
Food is the primary needs of human life, and food comes from agriculture. But the science of agriculture is not the familiar territory to human. Like the sun, air, water, the most important elements of our existence, but they are also the most overlooked resources. As a result, agriculture in long history, has been operating in a rather primitive way. That makes it into a low-income and the most volatile industry. Its production is the most unpredictable. Because of this, famine is never disappeared until now since the history of mankind. In fact agriculture covers a wide and advance knowledge. Human beings should put in more effort in agricultural science and agricultural investment to make agriculture as an easy, efficient and stable industry. Ensure humans the most basic resources for survival. In particular, new trends have shown that agricultural products have been not just in food. They will be more in line with environmental or ecological balance, sustainable development, the source of new energy and new materials. How to promote agricultural development, symbiotic with natural ecosystems, should be the key topics of concern and discussion.
'''Globalization of Markets and Competition: Trade is increasingly global in scope today. There are several reasons for this. One significant reason is technological—because of improved transportation and communication opportunities today, trade is now more practical. Thus, consumers and businesses now have access to the very best products from many different countries. Increasingly rapid technology lifecycles also increases the competition among countries as to who can produce the newest in technology. In part to accommodate these realities, countries in the last several decades have taken increasing steps to promote global trade through agreements such as the General Treaty on Trade and Tariffs, and trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the European Union (EU).''Italic text'''''
Madison residents are no strangers to mercury contamination in fish, a result of the high mercury levels present in Lake Monona. However, the global extent of mercury pollution is less widely-advertised. In August, the International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant met at the Monona Terrace and ratified a declaration claiming that reducing mercury use and emissions are necessary steps to lowering the health risks associated with the element and its compounds.\\n\\n“The declaration summarizes what we know about mercury in the environment, from a wide array of expertise,” said David Krabbenhoft, a research scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey and a conference co-chair.\\n\\nMercury is an environmental pollutant that has been released in increasing amounts by manufacturers ever since the Industrial Revolution. High levels of mercury exposure in humans have been shown to have a variety of toxic effects, many of which stem from mercury’s ability to inhibit enzymes from breaking down other toxins. From damaging developing fetuses to increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, mercury’s toxic effects are felt throughout one’s lifetime.\\n\\nThe conference did not dwell purely upon the human health risk, however. The declaration covered four major topics, including sources of mercury in the atmosphere, risk to humans, fish and wildlife, recovery of mercury-contaminated fisheries and socioeconomic impacts of mercury use and pollution.\\n\\nCurrently much of the mercury pollution comes from industrial mining operations worldwide, especially those mining gold and other precious metals. Miners release mercury compounds into the air as a byproduct of modern extraction techniques, and can accumulate toxic levels of some compounds in their body, contaminating their homes and communities.\\n\\n“About 10 to 15 million miners are using about a thousand tons of mercury a year to extract gold, exposing themselves and the families to elevated concentrations of mercury vapor and contributing to about ten percent of the human load of mercury to the global environment,” said Edward Swain, a conference co-chair and research scientist at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\\n\\nOther major sources of mercury pollution include coal-fired power plants and volcanic eruptions. Mercury also leaks slowly from many kinds of thermometers and fluorescent lamps.\\n\\n“It is clear that [long-term] mercury use and environmental releases of mercury have had significant social and economic cost,” Swain said.\\n\\nAs mercury is released into the surrounding environment, it travels up the food chain. Soil absorbs mercury compounds, which are drawn into plants through their roots. Animals consume these plants and slowly develop dangerous concentrations of mercury throughout their lives. Fish can also develop high concentrations of mercury simply by absorbing the chemical while swimming in mercury-heavy waters.\\n\\nHigh levels of mercury, if present in food animals, are easily passed to humans. Humans also absorb mercury from the surrounding atmosphere through the skin.\\n\\nMercury usage and pollution is heavily linked to the economic and political fabric of our world. Within the last 30 years, mercury emissions have increased in developing nations, counteracting the progress made in decreasing mercury emissions in developed states. Developed nations often have regulatory power over the production standards, while developing nations have much lower emissions standards in order to maintain production in a harsh economic climate.\\n\\nMercury, however, does not discriminate based upon socioeconomic status. Like any other global environmental hazard, mercury affects everyone.
The mission of the INDC is to increase our understanding of the effects of common food on long term health, performance, mental and physical fitness.\\n\\nTo achieve this goal, we need to gain insight into bioactive compounds in food, how they are absorbed and metabolized in the body, taking into account the genetic and metabolic uniqueness of individuals. \\n\\nThis requires very sensitive analytical methods to determine what we really eat. The same instrumentation can be used to control quality and content of food and to analyze metabolites and nutritional biomarkers.\\n\\nWe do not eat the same bread or drink the same beer that our grandparents did hundred years ago. Agriculture and food technology have changed greatly and must be taken into account to evaluate the effect of these technologies on the nutritional value of food and its effect on human health.\\n\\nWe also have to consider the health effect of our life style; one of sitting in front of the computer, in a car or on an airplane. Our body evolved to produce chemicals to help us to survive but with an active lifestyle. The result is that, we now live in a new state of physiological stress. \\n\\nMeaningful food recommendations based on such understanding is limited. It is critical to understand what to eat and how these foods are metabolized and what molecules are produced in the human body as a reaction to stress.\\n\\nIt is the goal of INDC to bring together an understanding of the food we eat with the analytical techniques needed to study them.\\n\\nINDC2012 will be held at Carolinum, Charles University in Prague, August 27-30, 2012. \\n\\nReferences:http://www.indc.cz/en/

The explosive beginning of our universe, the Big Bang marks the earliest time we can probe with current physical theory. Theory has to guide our understanding of the first fraction of a second, since we can’t recreate the extremely high temperatures that existed during the earliest history of the universe in any earthly laboratory. What theory tells us is that from an initial state in which matter and radiation are both in an extremely hot and dense form, the universe expands and the matter cools. At that time, it is believed that all four of the fundamental forces of nature—gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces—were unified.\\n\\n       The evolution of the earliest universe is not well understood because it is not clear exactly what laws were at work. However, it is known that by the end of the first second of time, the building blocks of matter had formed. By the end of the first three minutes, helium and other light nuclei (like deuterium) had formed but for a long time, temperatures remained too high for the formation of most atoms. At around one million years following the Big Bang, nuclei and electrons were at low enough temperatures to coalesce to form atoms. But the universe didn’t start to look like it does today until small perturbations in the matter distribution were able to condense to form the stars and galaxies we know today.
     There has been extensive coverage of Martin Luther King, Jr's troubles with the FBI.  As Donner's book "The Age of Surveillance" points out many other individuals and groups, integrationist and segregationist, were targeted by the FBI and other intelligence agencies.  Those targeted were subject to "agressive" intelligence.  That is actions to hinder or harm the organizations and individuals.  Such activity was so widespread that it appears to represent an official, but clandestine, policy.  This raises the possibility that the federal government or some part thereof had decided racial agitation during the Cold War could be an intolerable threat to national security.  Attempting to control racial agitation by legal action might actually increase racial animosities so clandestine action was required.  In view of the extent of this suppression of lower level racial agitators it was probably felt essential to "neutralize" Dr. King.  The same possibility occurs in the case of George Wallace.\\n     In both cases these assassinations or attempts were investigated by the federal government which may have been a party to them.  This raises more unanswered questions about these events.

Definition\\nMangrove restoration is the regeneration of mangrove forest ecosystems in areas where they have previously existed. The practice of mangrove restoration is grounded in the discipline of restoration ecology, which aims to “[assist] the recovery of resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed” (Forest Service Manual, 2000). Since environmental impacts are an ongoing threat, to successfully restore an ecosystem implies not merely to recreate its former condition, but to strengthen its capacity to adapt to change over time.\\n \\nMangrove forests, along with the animal species they shelter, represent globally significant sources of biodiversity and provide humanity with valuable ecosystem services. They are used by mammals, reptiles and migratory birds as feeding and breeding grounds, and provide crucial habitats for fish and crustacean species of commercial importance. The roots of the mangrove physically buffer shorelines from the erosive impacts of ocean waves and storms. Additionally, they protect riparian zones by absorbing floodwaters and slowing down the flow of sediment-loaded river water. This allows sediments to drop to the bottom where they are held in place, thus containing potentially toxic waste products and improving the quality of water and sanitation in coastal communities. \\n\\nTo the human communities who rely on them, mangrove forests represent local sources of sustainable income from the harvest of fish and timber, as well as non-timber forest products such as medicinal plants, palm leaves and honey. On a global scale, they have been shown to sequester carbon in quantities comparable to higher-canopy terrestrial rainforests, which means that they may play a role in mitigating climate change (Spalding, 2010), in addition to physically protecting coastlines from the projected sea-level rise associated with climate change (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). However, there are limits to the capacity of mangroves to adapt to climate change. It is projected that a 1-meter rise in sea level could inundate and destroy mangrove forests in many regions around the globe (IPCC AR4 [correct citation?]), which would leave coastal communities vulnerable to the risks of flooding, shoreline erosion, saline intrusion and increased storm activity (Field, 1995). \\n\\n2. Mangrove loss and degradation \\nThe issue of restoration is critical today since mangrove forests are being lost very quickly – at an even faster rate than tropical rainforests inland (Duke et al., 2007). A recent estimate puts the total mangrove area worldwide in 2005 at 152,000 km2 – down from 188,000 km2 in 1980 (Food and Agriculture Organization Report, 2007). In other words some 36,000 km2, or nearly 20% of the world’s mangroves, were lost over a period of twenty-five years. Other estimates of loss may differ due to having been drawn from a smaller pool of data. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment estimates the total loss worldwide at 35% between 1980 and 2000, but this result was drawn from data on only slightly more than half of the total mangrove area (MA, 2005). Much of this lost mangrove area was destroyed to make room for industry, housing and tourism development; for aquaculture, primarily shrimp farms; and for agriculture, such as rice paddies, livestock pasture and salt production (FAO, 2007). Other drivers of mangrove forest destruction include activities that divert their sources of freshwater, such as groundwater withdrawals, the building of dams, and the building of roads and drainage canals across tidal flats.\\n\\n3. Mangrove restoration \\nMangroves are sensitive ecosystems, changing dynamically in response to storms, sediment blockage, and fluctuations in sea level (Field, 1998) and present a “moving target” for restoration efforts. Different restoration approaches face this challenge in different ways. The most common method simply consists in planting stands of a single species of mangrove on mudflats, or other areas thought to be suitable, without consideration of whether or not they supported mangroves in the past. This approach usually fails over the long term because the underlying soil and hydrological requirements of the mangroves are not being met. More informed methods aim to bring a damaged mangrove area back into its preexisting condition, taking into account not only ecosystem factors but also social, cultural and political perspectives (Field, 1998). These approaches begin with the understanding that a damaged mangrove area may be able to repair itself through the natural processes of secondary succession, without being physically planted, provided that its tidal and freshwater hydrology is functioning normally and there is an adequate supply of seedlings (Lewis, 2005, 2009a, 2009b). Taking this into account, it becomes crucial to the success of a restoration project to evaluate what the hydrology of a disturbed mangrove site should look like under normal conditions, and the ways in which it has been modified.\\n\\nAn exemplar of this approach is the Ecological Mangrove Restoration method (Lewis, 2005, 2009a, 2009b) which recommends the following steps, to be undertaken using healthy mangroves of the surrounding area as a reference: 1) assess the ecology, especially reproduction and distribution patterns, of the mangrove species at the disturbed site; 2) map the topographical elevations and hydrological patterns that determine how seedlings should establish themselves at the site; 3) assess the changes made to the site that currently prevent the site from recovering by itself; 4) design a restoration plan that begins by restoring the normal range of elevations and tidal hydrology at the site; and 5) monitor the site to determine if the restoration has been successful in light of the original objectives. The actual planting of seedlings is a last resort, since it fails in many cases (Lewis, 2005); it should be considered only if natural recruitment of seedlings fails to reach the restoration objective. \\n\\n4. Additional considerations\\nAn important but often overlooked aspect of mangrove restoration efforts is the role that the local communities play as stakeholders in the process and the outcome. Since they may directly feel the effects of restoration projects, they should be involved in the process as much as feasibly possible, from decision-making to maintenance over the long term. Their involvement and local knowledge, as well as collaboration with other stakeholders such as sponsors and governing agencies, is crucial to the success of restoration projects.\\n\\n5. Limitations\\nIn some areas, restoration may be prohibitively difficult due to the degradation of the soil that regularly follows the clear-cutting of mangrove forests. Common effects include advanced erosion of the soil, loss of nutrients, high levels of salinity, and/or buildup of toxins (Field, 1998). However, even without this extent of degradation, the soil may be come unable to host plant life at all due to the loss of the live mangrove roots, which exuded oxygen and carbohydrate into the soil and maintained its quality. \\n\\nUsing foresight early in the restoration process to carefully select sites that are likely to succeed as self-maintaining ecosystems, as well as ensuring that proper management is built into the conservation effort, can prevent the waste of time and energy that often accompanies restoration projects. The long-lasting aftereffects of mangrove degradation underscore the importance of eliminating its causes, since once sites are cleared, they may never completely recover. \\n\\n6.

In recent years many of the world leading ancient wonders preservators have published that the modern environment has a large impact on these historic buildings and sites.\\nOne of the latest discoveries in this field states that ultraviolet radiation(UVR) has a large impact on the material from which these buildings are built.\\nThe material itself may be imune to such things at first, but being exsposed to it for such a long time surely takes it toll, not to mention that time itself slowly degrades all materials on Earth.\\nIn these statments the leading researchers say that UVR seems to influence the bonds between atoms and molecules, and with this making the material(in this case rock) much less durable than usually.\\nSuch cases were found in Egypt(Pyramids), Rome(Coliseum)and almost all other locations where there are hot and dry summers(deserts, mediterainian climate).
=== Understanding Climate Change ===\\n{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n\\nContents\\n\\n    1. Introduction to Climate Change\\n    2. Cause of Climate Change\\n    3. Proof of Climate Change\\n    4. Solutions to Climate Change\\n    5. Overview\\n   \\n\\n\\n1. Governments and scientists alike have agreed that climate change is real and serious. It is a major environmental issue that affects many aspects of today’s society and will affect everyone in the future. Climate change is not a new matter although numerous plans have been implemented recently to accommodate this important issue, particularly in Australia. The continuation of greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere naturally and unnaturally, contributes to the global warming of the planet which causes severe problems which society will have to deal with in generations to come. Not only will we as a society have to look into using cleaner forms of energy, but also sustainable energy that can accommodate the worlds requirements as we expand globally. \\n\\n[[File:Vegetation Induced Circular Snowmelt.jpg|thumb|right|Melted Snow due to the effects of global warming ]]\\n\\n2. There is overwhelming evidence that our climate is changing due to human activities and through natural processes which is unequivocal. One of the main factors that contribute to our climate change in recent years is the increase of greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere, trapping the ultraviolet rays produced by the sun in the earth’s atmosphere and slowly heating the planet. These greenhouse gases are composed of a variety of gases that can absorb and emit infrared radiation such as: carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide and are released mainly through the burning and consumption of fossil fuels. These fossil fuels are what drive the majority of the electrical and motorised power that we use today, from lighting to vehicles to massive industrial power stations and are the main sources of the world’s power. Although, this damaging power comes at a cost, where the environment we live in suffers whilst society continues to use more and more, disregarding the potential threats and problems that are sure to follow with this costly system of living.\\n\\n\\n3. Climate change is the variation in the average pattern of weather over a long period of time. It is generally referred to as ‘global warming’ as all of the earth’s entities are gradually heated by the trapped ultraviolet rays in the atmosphere. This alteration in the weather causes countless problems for the earth’s environment and all living things. The evidence is clear, the increase of global average air, ocean and land temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and the rising of sea levels globally. This causes many detrimental effects for the environments ecosystems and for the animals living in them, for example, the melting of the polar ice caps that are home to polar bears makes it extremely difficult for them to live and thrive as much of their home has been dissolved. Everyone and everything is affected by climate change even on a local level, in Darwin, Australia the rainfall in certain areas has caused major flooding in some low-lying parts, this occurs at high tide when the creeks overflow, although only recently has the flooding occurred due to the rising sea levels. The flooding ruined many houses in the area, blocking roads and caused thousands of dollars’ worth of damages and this is only the beginning. If the greenhouse gases continue to be released into the atmosphere to instigate these chains of events, the disasters in the future will be a lot worse and potentially life-threatening.\\n\\n4. Climate change can be minimised and it is possible to contribute positively to the reduction of greenhouse gases and therefore global warming. Much of the damage afflicted to our planet over the years is irreversible, although there are countless methods and solutions to help save our earth from early catastrophe.  Organizations like ‘Greenpeace’ have numerous ways to protect the environment and work towards sustainable lifestyles that aren’t harmful to the environment.  Some methods that can be incorporated on a large scale is the use of energy-efficient light bulbs which save power by using less current, this has proven to be successful as it reduces the amount of power needed to produce light and therefore less fossil fuels are consumed and less greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. Renewable energy sources such as solar power, wind power and tidal power are also ways to help reduce the emissions produced by using them as alternative energy sources. Other methods that the Australian government have implemented to reduce greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere by large industries is the clean energy bill. The Australian government proposed the clean energy bill in a bid to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and limit global warming by forcing businesses to pay $23 per tonne of CO2 emissions which will pressure large businesses into finding alternative fuel sources that are renewable. Through innovation and creativity, society can find various forms of alternative energy that does not harm our environment and restore it so that the inhabitants of the ecosystems can thrive.\\n\\n5. Global warming also referred to as climate change in the modern society has a large impact on all living things on the planet. The effects of these changes in weather can cause major disruptions in ecosystems potentially destroying habitats of animals and their environment that is irreplaceable. Many solutions are available to help reduce the ever increasing global warming and work towards a cleaner, greener society.
EDUCATION IN COSTA RICA.\\n\\nIn what used to be a poverty-stricken rural backwater, it is understandable that the country's high standards of schooling are a source of enormous national pride. With foregone military budgets funding the massive education system, the only armies these days are hordes of neatly-uniformed schoolchildren on their way to and from school-one of the most ubiquitous images of Costa Rica.\\n\\nEducation is seen as the means to income (salaries are determined by academic level)and status-everyone wants to be cultured. As nearly every job, however menial, requires a high-school education, many adults study at evening classes or through distance learning, choosing from the huge array of courses available.\\n\\nWhile the level of education in Costa Rica is clearly high for the region, and one of the reasons why the country is so popular with foreign business investors in Costa Rica real estate, it seems that a good education is increasingly becoming an issue of wealth.
Viral Influenza Shedding:  It appears that reliable information about viral shedding of Influenza A in general and the current H1N1 "Swine Flu" epidemic is not readily available. In order to rationally recommend quarantine of affected individuals in schools, work sites or other closed communities, it is necessary to know the rate at which affected individuals become less contagious to others. This page is intended to attract commentary from knowledgeable contributors about how rapidly  H1N1 infected individuals can be returned to their communities without unduly risking their colleagues. Although current public health policy recommends isolation from 5 to 10 days after the apparent onset of illness, the scientific basis for this recommendation seems obscure beyond experiments involving artificial viral infection with vaccination strains.
In business, reducing operations to the bare minimum required to continue serving existing business; colloquially, the least necessary to 'keep the lights on'. It emphasizes only those functions needed to continue serving the firm's customers and slows/halts/cancels all other operations (research, development, hiring, promotions and non-salary compensation, capital improvements, etc.)\\n\\nDuring bad economic times, the progression of operations to a lights-on mode typically takes place over several weeks or months of cutbacks, project cancellations and layoffs. \\n\\nThe term also applies to much faster-developing situations, such as a disaster, pandemic or other event that renders large portions of the workforce or infrastructure unable to function. \\n\\nAt larger firms, this mode is part of formal Operational Plan under a variety of names ('Run the Firm', 'Reduced-overhead', etc.)  The Plan is used as a tool to catgeorize projects, assets and infrastructure as part of normal operations. While this is usually to help plan for rapid-onset crises, the same designations eventually apply to a slow-moving economic downturn. \\n\\nSmaller firms usually do not have such formal plans, instead relying on management to designate key people and projects.

The results indicate that trauma is caused by the consequence of young people becoming homeless, and the lives of these men and women should be understood. Other causes for homelessness are issues from people living in poverty, lack of employment, houses being too expensive, gentrification and violence. All of these reasons is why people are now becoming homeless at young ages. \\n\\nYoung children are becoming homeless as well. There are major risks for homeless children, such as poor health care, not having a good well-being and having bad social outcomes. These children are exposed to a very stressful life style, they witness a lot of domestic violence, mental health difficulties and most likely to come from a broken home. In about every 200 children in America, 3 will become homeless today and more then double of that will be at risk for homelessness. School is impacted by homelessness, because of residency requirements, guardianship requirements, delays in transfer of school credits, use of transportation and lack of health resources. Even the children who still attend school that are homeless, have a low attendance record.\\n\\nThere have been alliances that organizations have created to end homelessness. There are studies and estimations that have been made to figure out how many individuals today are homeless. There are strategies that are listed about how to end it and ways to gain more knowledge on the topic as well.
I'm an Astronomy Masters student with a particular interest in terraforming and space colonisation. I wholeheartedly believe that there's an urgent need to solve humanity's problems by making clear advancements in space discovery and colonisation. We need, now more than ever, to start thinking in bigger terms and move on from our earth-bound, earth-centric view. With thousands of years of progress already under our belts, now's the time to step up and take ourselves to the next level. Creative solutions to pressing problems are urgently required! Advancements will only come from more research and hence from greater funding. And that will only come about if there is a groundswell of understanding and support significant enough to shift the political and economic agenda.
Africa Mission Alliance (AMA) is a faith-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Portland, Oregon with subsidiaries in East and Central Africa. The work of AMA began in the country of Rwanda in 2003 as a few individuals dedicated to caring for orphans, widows and the needy in this genocide ravaged country. AMA’s dream is to reach beyond Rwanda into all of Africa and see a new generation of Africans becoming change agents in their vulnerable communities. \\nThe mission of Africa Mission Alliance is to bring professional and general public resources together for the purposes of training, equipping, and supporting local communities in Africa to develop self-sustaining, community-based approaches to solving their problems.\\n\\nAMA believes that the people of Africa do not want to live on handouts. They need help to discover and use their own vision, skills, and resources to achieve self-sufficiency. Africa Mission Alliance is committed to walking and working with communities in Africa by empowering them to build sustainable communities. The larger vision is to address critical needs that hinder development by helping communities receive quality education, skills training, basic health care, access to clean water, and micro-finance loans
contingency plan\\n\\nA contingency plan is a plan devised for an exceptional risk that, though unlikely, would have catastrophic consequences. Contingency plans are often devised by governments or businesses. For example, suppose many employees of a company are traveling together on an aircraft which crashes, killing all aboard. The company could be severely strained or even ruined by such a loss. Accordingly, many companies have procedures to follow in the event of such a disaster. The plan may also include standing policies to mitigate a disaster's potential impact, such as requiring employees to travel separately or limiting the number of employees on any one aircraft.\\n\\nDuring times of crisis, contingency plans are often developed to explore and prepare for any eventualit
Is the Kyoto Protocol heading toward (or does it already contain) provisions for emissions trading or a [[cap and trade]] program?\\n\\nWill nations such as India and China which won't be bound by the protocol, nevertheless participate in a trading program? That is, will they get tens of billions of dollars from the industrialized West (US and Europe) simply for doing nothing?\\n\\nIf global warming is caused by sunspots more than carbon dioxide, and the average atmosphure temperatures levels off at 1.0C to 1.5C higher than the 2000 level, won't the whole thing have amounted to nothing more than an international welfare program for countries with anti-free-market economic policies?\\n\\nI worry about this sort of thing, you know.\\n\\n[[user:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]], Wednesday, June 12, 2002
'''Psoriasis''' is an auto-immune disease with symptoms of red, itchy, scaly, and inflamed. Most suffers typically treat themselves with over-the-counter treatments and prescribed medications. Many negative side effects are attributed to the use of prescribed medications.\\n\\nFor years the herbal treatments for the reduction of psoriasis symptoms have been largely ignored by mainstream physicians. Many health food stores and alternative practitioners are embracing the use of herbs in their stores, practices, and suggestive selling.\\n\\nOne of the trend setters in this arena is a small company out of Tampa, FL., SielosRx. Their use of organic herbs in a cleansing and soothing regimen has caught the eye of local Dermatologist, Dr. Francis Caban. He sees people who have normally received limited results with traditional medications obtain surprising results within weeks of using nothing more than the organic herbs in these products.\\n\\nDr. Caban insists the results are genuine and has offered SielosRx to his clients when they are considering treatment options. He is firm in his belief that psoriasis suffers can choose how they reduce the symptoms of their disease. They no longer have to just suffer or take the medications that have potentially harmful side effects.
<blockquote>\\nThe Earth Sciences (also known as geoscience, the geosciences or Earth Science) is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth. It is a special type of planetary science; it studies the planet we live on: the structure and composition of the Earth, its origins, physical features, changing aspects, and all of its natural phenomena. The major disciplines of The Earth Sciences use physics, mathematics and, chemistry to build a quantitative understanding of the principal areas or spheres of the Earth system. Like in many sciences, The Earth can be studied both experimentally and theoretically. Also, there are both reductionist and holistic approaches to Earth Science. Applications of the Earth Sciences include the exploration and exploitation of mineral and hydrocarbon resources, cartography, weather forecasting patterns, and warning of volcanic eruptions. The Earth Sciences are related to the environmental sciences as well as the other subfields of planetary astronomy.\\n</blockquote>

\\n'''Reasons For Unemployment in Kerala'''\\n\\nIt is interesting to know that the State with the highest literacy rate — almost 97 per cent — has the highest unemployment rate when compared to others. Kerala is known for large-scale migration of skilled labour to other States and countries. \\n\\nA few millions of people of the State have been working outside it for many years. Had they remained in Kerala, the unemployment rate would have been much higher than what was quoted in the article. \\n\\nWhat ails the State that has such a high literacy rate and is also blessed by vast natural resources? \\n\\nDoes the education system make people lethargic or rights-conscious or inefficient or unenterprising to start productive activities for their own progress? Does the education system make people more destructive in nature? \\n\\nNo industrialist wants to set up any industry in Kerala due to labour problems. The State is bankrupt, besides being corrupt and largely politicised. Trade unionism is still alive in Kerala. West Bengal was industrially ruined by the same attitude of the workers despite a highly skilled labour force. \\n\\nInstead of migrating to other States for jobs, Keralites should use their knowledge and expertise in establishing new productive activity on their own. Many of them should look at self-employment for overcoming the serious problem of unemployment.
'''PRANAV'''\\nThe Changing Nature Of Festivals – Fun Or Rituals? \\nPeople from different religions and regions all over India celebrate a number of festivals – religious, cultural and social. The celebrations of such festivals help people come together, shed their egos and the consciousness of individual identities and results in integration. Man is a social animal. He has formed a society and has maintained his own culture. Culture clubs together religion, territorial necessities and requirements of nature and civilisation. The essence of culture can be seen in many festivals. Festivals celebrated all over India follow different regional traditions. Common festivals celebrated in India are Raksha-Bandhan, Navratri, Rangpanchami, Ganesh Utsav etc.In recent years there has been some criticism about the supposedly excessive use of firecrackers, especially during the Hindu festival of Deepavali. The most commonly cited reason is the noise pollution caused by firecrackers.The noise from firecrackers has a more deleterious effect on animals who have a more sensitive sense of hearing than humans. Pets such as dogs and cats, as well as stray cattle in and around cities are most affected. Voluntary and non-profit organizations such as People for Animals educate the public about these issues.Another criticism is that smog caused by firecrackers may be harmful to inhale and can cause difficulty for drivers because of reduced visibility. The usage of "rockets" near apartment buildings has also given rise to many injuries. No law prohibiting this has been passed.
12forests, was founded in Chicago, IL, in 2008. The focus of the organization is  to help the world end exploitation and its causes. It uses proven vedic and yogic methodologies, to distribute karma free vegetarian food, educate and develop sustainable villages. Its outlook is always wide, focusing on how the world views the environment and all living beings.  Understanding the importance of clean and safe environment it introduces everyone to proven strategies of simple development based on cows and land.  12forests which comes from an extensive research background on the importance of cows, as seen in ayurveda and yoga.  The dung and urine of the cow provides for an antiseptic environment which would help third world countries counteract the threats of unsanitary conditions.  Also, it helps to set aside petroleum based and human feces fertilizers as used in the USA and Mexico.  These fertilizers have caused countless deaths in the form of e.coli and cancers, and not to speak of destroying water supplies.  So based on the highest scientific models 12forests is helping poverty stricken children, families and the environment from forced degradation.\\n<ref>12forests.org</ref>
	Abortion has become one of the most divisive issues in American society today, and differing opinions often lead to heated discussions, political division, and even violence.Ever since the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v Wade, this controversial issue has split the nation. Some people agree with Roe and support abortion, others are against it. It is obviously a problem that needs to be solved, and quickly.\\n        The battle over abortion has been going on for a very long time, but really came to public view after the supreme court decision in Roe v Wade.  In this case, a woman whom the court discretely called "Jane Roe" sued in order for women to be able to legally have abortions, even if not in a life threatening situation. The court ruled in her favor, but since then there have been multiple attempts to overturn their decision.
In Alaska, the significant variation in both climate and population make standard architectural applications impractical. The summer months in Alaska draw in more than half of the yearly income for the state due to the increase in construction, commercial fishing, logging and mining, and the tourism industry.  In some regions, including southeastern Alaska, the population fluctuates as much as two thirds from January to July.  This irregularity creates a huge strain on the city especially in the realm of housing.  The majority of the seasonal population is currently expected to live in modular housing units fabricated to withstand less than three years, demanding an unbelievable amount of government funds that could be used elsewhere for city development.  Not only is this economically and environmentally unsound, but it provides only the bare necessities for this population.  This is why a seasonal housing facility is pivotal to the success of the state as a whole and specifically to those cities with a large seasonal population.  The large variation in population between the summer and winter months has created a need for housing types that can “hibernate” seasonally to reduce the amount of necessary energy and maintenance. Not only would this produce a more suitable and environmentally conscious method of housing the seasonal population, but also increase the possibility of permanent residence through an increase in the quality of life.  Although the application of seasonal buildings would be beneficial to most cities in the state of Alaska because of the migration patterns of the seasonal populations, the city of Juneau is particularly affected.  This city, the state’s capital, looses almost one third of its population in this seasonal shift, and yet has maintained a significant role in the economic success of the state.   However, Juneau suffers from housing shortages, urban sprawl and unfavorable living conditions.  This is why the application of a fluctuating, multifamily housing facility would accommodate the seasonal population, densify the current population, and employ environmentally responsive technology to help reduce the overall cost of living.  The success of the proposed building type would change the face of Alaskan housing and address the housing crisis that has for so long gone unaddressed. \\n  The underdevelopment of Alaska is often attributed to the unusual conditions of its latitude including dramatic variation in sunlight hours and harsh weather conditions.  However, this argument is undermined when compared to other cities at the same 60oN Latitude.  Glasgow, Scotland, St. Petersburg, Russia, and Stockholm, Sweden are all located within 5 degrees of the latitude of Juneau Alaska, and all are very established ranging in population from .5-5 million.  In addition, these cities are all major contributor to the overall GDP of their respective countries. The city layouts demonstrate the success of the area with the densely build scheme.  The feature of these cities that is not shared by Juneau is the topography.  All of these cities have a very flat landscape making development much less difficult and also ease in the circulation through and into the region.  It can then be concluded that in Alaska the topographical challenge is more detrimental to the development of the state than the cold climate. \\nThe land area of Alaska is 656425 square miles making it account for almost 20% of the total land area of the United States.  It is by far the largest state at more than 60% the size of Texas, 75% the size of California, and 93% larger than Pennsylvania, and yet is one of the most underdeveloped and underutilized areas in the nation.   The land features significant natural resources and the largest amount of coast line out of any other state in the United States.  \\n\\nThe average population of the United States falls just above 304 million.  The average population per state is just above 6 million, and yet the largest state, that which encompasses almost 1/5 of the United States territory has only 626, 932 inhabitants, almost half of the population of Rhode Island.  These numbers are even more significant when one compares the population density of various states.  Alaska with its vast lands and miniscule population is by far the least dense, having an average of only 1.2 residents per square mile. \\nThe states chosen for comparison have a wide variety of geographic and climatic aspects which shows the diversity of population density over the nation, but none even comes close to the discrepancy between these numbers and those exhibited in the region of Alaska.  It is also strange that Alaska’s proximity to the Pacific Northwest, the religion currently experiencing the largest national population growth, has not more directly affected the influx into this adjacent territory.\\n	The economic trends in the United States have a very significant impact on the economy of Alaska.  The trend over the last 30 years has consistently demonstrated this relationship.  During times of economic turmoil in the US, namely recessions, the migration to Alaska increases drastically.  This is largely due to the more stable job market in Alaska, one that operates more independently from other states in the nation.  The lower chart shows the average state GDP vs. various state’s GDP.   The GDP of Alaska is above the US average.  This should result in a higher population due to a more stable economy, as is the trend in the United States, yet the result is inconsistent in Alaska. \\nThe city of Juneau offers a variety of locations that would benefit from the establishment of a large scale housing facility.  This is largely due to the fact that housing development is currently sprawling into the outskirts of the city lines because of cheap and more buildable land.  This has expanded the city limits, but not the density or even overall population.  In addition to sprawl, in the last 30 years the center of Juneau has shifted from the historic downtown area to the land surround the airport.  Unfortunately this diversion has left the downtown in disrepair.  The migration has occurred because the land surround the downtown area is more difficult to build upon, making construction of single family homes more expensive, and because of the significance of the Juneau Airport as a primary gateway into the state of Alaska.  The city is essentially being split in half socially and industrially.  Reorganizing the city development of the city to focus on the historical downtown area would help preserve the city as a destination and not merely a transit hub.  Locating a housing facility in this area would help facilitate this effort, making it more affordable to establish residence.  It would also reduce the need for public transportation because the majority of employment, especially tourism and government based professions, occurs in this section of the city. \\nThe intended program to be developed on this site is a large scale housing facility.  This facility will cater to a variety of people with different needs throughout the city of Juneau.  The core of the facility will be made up of two and three bedroom units that correspond with the current housing market demand in the area.  In addition to these standard units, a portion of the development will be dedicated to affordable housing units to accommodate the portion of the population that is below the poverty line, including a large portion of the native population in and around Juneau.  In addition, a portion of the units will be seasonally adjustable creating a facility that can fluctuate either physically or systematically to accommodate the seasonal population influx.   This portion of the structure will not merely be cut off from the establishment when not in use, but like the city, will change in use to enhance the facility for the permanent residents.  The establishment of a stable and changing population could be a mutually advantageous relationship. The permanent residents help reduce the maintenance and upkeep to the temporary facilities during the off season and in turn receive a portion of the profit from the seasonal residents.  This relationship would change the dynamic between the two groups are result in a more community centered organization.  In addition to housing units, the facility will include amenities that not only increase its desirability for both temporary and permanent residents, but also work to draw in the surrounding community and population of downtown Juneau.  These amenities will be defined and located in a way to ensure security for the residents while still increasing public circulation to and through the building.  The facility will also be developed in a way that is environmentally sensitive in design and perception.  It will capitalize on the aesthetically unique features of the context and utilize the favorable site conditions to become more self sustaining.  The development of a successful housing system will increase the density in downtown Juneau and provide the citizens with a more habitable and experientially significant living experience.\\n<ref>http://ruralhealth.hrsa.gov/pub/seasonalpopulation.asp#Case1.

What are Prayer Wheels?\\n\\n   Prayer wheels contain the words of the Buddha: teachings of wisdom and compassion. While the Buddha's discourses fill many volumes, they may also be condensed into syllables with deep symbolic meaning known as mantra. Tibetans recite these profound and inspiring texts to instill them in memory and promote the well­being of others. \\n\\n   The Tibetan term "dharma wheel" has been rendered into English as "prayer wheel". Yet prayer wheels are much more than supplicants to a higher spirit. They can contain the full potency and meaning of the path to enlightenment.\\n\\n   Believing that turning dharma wheels filled with these texts and symbols is equivalent to reciting them, Tibetans place dharma wheels in monasteries, temples, and libraries and turn them at every opportunity to convey the blessings of compassion and harmony, prevent natural disasters, and promote peace in the world. Although dharma wheels were known in ancient India and Nepal, only in Tibet did they become an integral part of daily life. Today as in ages past, the dharma wheels are honored as symbols of enlightened knowledge, able to evoke the healing powers of the mind and increase its capacities for wisdom.\\n\\n   In recent years, the world has seen how quickly knowledge-even when valued and protected by an entire culture-can be brought to the brink of extinction. In response, we have made great efforts to preserve the cultural heritage of Tibet, including the intricate science of dharma wheels, which are in themselves ways of preserving and disseminating the benefits of enlightened knowledge. Having created more than a thousand 4 foot high wheels for our own organization and donated 100,000 of the hand-held wheels to individuals in the Himalayan region, we have come to share the view that dharma wheels have a calming and healing influence on the environment and human beings, qualities greatly needed in our world today.
Timber framed boat docks are toxic playgrounds.  In 2001, the EPA banned \\narsenic treated wood from our children’s playgrounds because of the deadly \\nhazards of exposure.  Yet, treated timbers are still being used to build boat \\ndocks in many areas throughout the country.  These timbers continuer to leach \\ndeadly toxins year after year.\\n\\nPressure-treated boards and timbers are leaking poisonous arsenic into our \\nsoil and waterways.  The arsenic comes from 'chromated copper arsenate', CCA, \\nan infusion of pesticides, fungicides, and preservatives to delay the natural \\ndecaying process of wood.  These known carcinogens, have been linked to many \\ncancers, poisonings, severe skin rashes, and many other health issues.\\n\\nCCA treated wood, a very common boat dock building material, exposes us to \\nunnecessary danger when we are most vulnerable.  Barely clothed, barefoot, and \\nwet the very waters around these docks continually wash the treated surfaces \\nwhere we play.  All reports and handling guidelines suggest we were gloves, \\nglasses, and long sleeve shirts when handling CCA treated wood.  Yet, once in \\nplace as our waterfront play ground, we can't expect our children to go \\nswimming with so much protection.\\n\\nMore than 30 million pounds of pure arsenic comes  into the U.S. each year. \\nMuch of this is used in treating wood and timbers that will be used in dock \\nconstruction. Ultimately, the vast majority of this will end up in local \\nlandfills where it can leach into soil and local waterways.\\n[[User:Saveourwaters|Saveourwaters]] ([[User talk:Saveourwaters|talk]]) 00:03, 4 June 2008 (UTC)Lin Rimple
== Recycing- the need ==\\n\\n<br />The need for recycling has greatened over the past thirty years as the realisation of global warming has spread throughout the governments of the world. As the threat of rising sea levels, unstable weather conditions and ultimately a heating world creeps upon mankind, some people have decided to take action while others take a back seat. Whatever attitude the world has the simple fact is that changes in the climate are happening and recycling and other methods can contribute to limit the effect of global warming.\\n<br />\\n*[[global warming-overview]]\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n== Global warming-overview==\\nGlobal warming is occurring throughout the world because of increased levels of Carbon Dioxide being emmitted has caused (it is widely believed) the o-zone layer to thicken therefore trapping the suns energy inside the earths atmosphere and heating the earth accordingly.
'''Aquati Equini'''\\nThe Planet of Water!\\n&\\nThe Ancient City of Atlantis!\\n<gallery>\\nImage:Example.jpg|Caption1\\n</gallery>\\n\\nThe Earth as we know today is millions of years old and has undergone many transformations and metamorphic changes. Our planet Aquati Equini the "Earth" and its evolution of the ecosystem, with its physical and spiritual beings is the third planet from the Sun, and the largest of the terrestrial planets in the Solar System in terms of diameter, mass and density. It is also referred to as the World, the Blue Planet, and Terra continues to evolve.It is in the physical world (the third dimension of reality or so called duality)we find ourselves in a world of constant change and unstable eventuality.\\n\\nHome to millions of species,including humans, Earth is the only place in the universe where we find life is known to exist today. The planet formed 4.54 billion years ago,and life appeared on its surface within a billion years. Since then, Earth's biosphere has significantly altered the atmosphere and other abiotic conditions on the planet, enabling the proliferation of aerobic organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which, together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks harmful radiation, permitting life on land.The physical properties of the Earth, as well as its geological history and orbit, allowed life to persist during this period. The world is expected to continue supporting life for another 1.5 billion years, after which the rising luminosity of the Sun will eliminate the biosphere.\\n\\n----\\n\\nMR
A scientific phrase used to explain the recent phenomenon of the gradual cooling of the Gulf Stream.  The phrase comes from the noted effect of heat exchange in the blood flow in the reindeer's body.  In order to conserve warmth, the blood flowing ethrough the legs of a reindeer is considerably colder than that of the rest of it's body.  This is achieved by a heat exchange system; see http://library.thinkquest.org/3500/caribou.html for more details.\\nThis effect has been used to describe the recently discovered cooling of the Gulf Stream while the original equatorial currents have remained of the same temperature.  Over the last 20 years the temperature of the Gulf Stream (passing from the coast of South America up through the Atlantic and past the British Isles) has been studied by scientists in Scotland.  A recent report, published by both the Scientific Institute for Climate Research and Greenpeace, states that the temperature of the Gulf Stream near Scotland has dropped by three degrees celsius over twenty years and by two degrees over the last ten years.  This accelerated cooling has been attributed to the melting of the arctic ice shelf but is disputed by many scientists, mostly in America, where the report has been met with some incredulity.  See the Greenpeace website for a full version of the report.
Although the company labels itself as being environmentally friendly, but BP a major cause of pollution, actually ranked within the top ten worst environmentally friendly corporations. The company is a accused of greenwashing. BP changed its name from British Petroleum to BP, standing for "beyond petroleum" and adopted a yellow sunflower similar to that of the Canadian Green Party symbol. They appear to be green but in fact, none of these green symbols properly portray the company. \\n\\nBetween January 1997 and March 1998, the company was responsible for 104 oil spills and has also been charged for burying polluted gases. The company has also been permitted to dump nearly two-thousand pounds of ammonia and almost five thousand pounds into Lake Michigan everyday. BP allowed 270,000 gallons of oil to spread into the Alaskan tundra, and only admitted to doing so after they were confronted by journalists. BP is responsible for fifteen deaths after one of their oil refineries in Texas exploded. It's also been reported that BP is responsible for spilling nearly two thousand gallons of chemicals onto frozen tundra in Alaska. The chemicals that spilled are poisonous to plants and aniamls, and will melt the tundra. \\n\\nBP does not have good environmental standing. The company donataes over five million dollars to political campaigns, possibly an effort of stay in business and be exempt from US laws. They are guilty of killing and harming the planet, not just in the United States but all over the globe. They are listed as one of Scotland's largest polluters.
The U.S. frequently uses its economic power in order to punish other countries.  One of the ways the U.S. does this is by holding back on exporting food.   Reasons for the punishment of another country vary; however, they can be broken down into two main groups: Foreign containment objective and market development/humanitarian objectives.  The foreign containment objective tends to punish those countries who are threatening to the U.S.  An example of such a threat would be countries under other forms of government.   More examples related to the containment objective would be:  no aid to communist countries, no aid to socialist governments, no aid to countries who support radical regimes, no aid to regimes with an inadequate democracy who are too weak to be anti-communist (effectively), no aid to countries who will not accept U.S. agreements.  An example of market development and humanitarian objectives would fall under a category of countries that are trying to compete with the U.S. economically.  The U.S. will execute foreign aid punishments to countries trying to nationalize property of U.S. companies, countries who want to take over functions by U.S. companies, and countries trying to initiate nationalistic economic policies.
Hemostasis is the arrest of bleeding by the physiological properties of vasoconstriction and coagulation; or more simply, blood clotting. \\nFor our Wiki project we would like to take a closer look at the Hemostasis process, how it happens, and what factors in and outside of the body affect it. By understanding how it works on a cellular level we would like to find out how other things in our bodies can affect it, such as vasoconstriction, vasodilation, age, and the heart. We would like to find out what proteins play a major role in the  hemostasis process and if by adding or taking away certain nutrients can greatly affect the hemostatic response. As far as outside influences we want to figure out the negative and positive effects of different drugs, and certain diseases such as Von Willebrand’s disease and Thrombophilia. \\nBy understanding how the process works and what factors change the response, we believe we can provide an adequate response and a description of how hemostasis works in correlation with the rest of the body.
My report on Thoroughbreds so far:\\n\\nThoroughbreds have a well-chiseled head. Thoroughbreds are considered a hot-blooded horse because of their agility, speed, and spirit.\\n\\nThe thoroughbred that is known today was developed in the 17th and the 18th century, which was 1600 and 1700. All modern Thoroughbreds can find their pedigrees to three stallions originally transported into England in the 1600s and 1700s. During the 1800s and the 1700s, the Thoroughbred breed went around the world. Many thoroughbreds exist worldwide today ,with over 118,000 people registered each year worldwide.   \\n\\nThoroughbreds are usually used for racing but also bred for other riding disciplines, such as show jumping, combined training, and more. They are also cross-bred with other breeds to create new breeds or improve existing breeds.\\n\\nThoroughbred racehorses perform with maximum effort, which has resulted on high rates of accidents and other health problems. Also, thoroughbreds are prone to other health problems, including bleeding from the lungs, small hearts, and more. There are several theories for the reasons behind the frequency of accidents and health problems in the  thoroughbred breed, and research continues into how to reduce the accident rate and treat those animals that are injured.\\n\\nThoroughbreds are most often bay, seal brown, chestnut, black, or gray. The less common colors that are recognized in the United States are roan, palomino, and more. White is not seen that much, but it is also known color separate from the gray.
\\n\\nDual-coding theory, a theory of cognition, was first advanced by Allan Paivio of the University of Western Ontario in 1971. The theory postulates that both visual and verbal information are processed differently and along distinct channels with the human mind creating separate representations for information processed in each channel. Both visual and verbal codes for representing information are used to organize incoming information into knowledge that can be acted upon, stored, and retrieved for subsequent use.\\nEach channel also has limitations. For example, humans have difficulty simultaneously attending to multiple auditory or visual cues, depending on expertise with the task or prior knowledge with the subject area. For example, a television documentary that shows images of plant and animal life in a rain forest while also simultaneously providing narration that describes the animal life could potentially provide for improved learning using the dual-code theory because the visual and verbal information does not compete with each other.\\nA multimedia presentation that shows multiple visuals such as an image of a speaker as well as the text that the speaker is reading, such as a series of bullet points, could overwhelm the viewer, depending on the person and the situation, because the viewer must now attend to two images.
'''Groundwork'''\\n\\nEstablished in 1981, Groundwork is a voluntary environmental organisation, dedicated to the preservation of some of Ireland's most precious habitats: the oak woodlands in Killarney National Park, Co. Kerry.\\n\\nMost of Groundwork’s focus has been on the removal of the invasive Rhododendron ponticum from Killarney National Park.\\n\\nThe unique ecology of the Killarney oak woodlands is seriously threatened by the invasion of Rhododendron ponticum. This non-native shrub thrives in the mild and moist conditions in Killarney and can spread rapidly especially where soils are acidic. Within 25 years rhododendron can form impenetrable thickets with plants up to six metres in height. These thickets cast such a dense shade that almost nothing can grow beneath them. This prevents the regeneration of the oakwoods.\\n\\nDuring the last 27 years Groundwork has changed from a small group of environmentally-concerned Irish students to an organisation attracting conservation-minded people from all over the world to carry out voluntary work in one of Ireland's most beautiful natural landscapes.\\n\\nSee http://www.groundwork.ie
Overview\\nThe United States is the world’s largest producer of beef, according to the USDA. The United States also has the largest fed-cattle industry in the world, primarily high-quality, grain-fed beef used for both domestic and export use.\\n\\nThe U.S. beef industry has undergone massive improvements in overall system efficiency. High-quality beef continues to flow to consumers even as the overall cattle and calf inventory has dropped from 130 million in 1975 to 92.6 million in 2011 (NASS). This is occurring because of significant improvements to genetics, which has virtually doubled the weaning weights since the 1960s and has made it possible to consistently deliver an animal that has gained 1,000 pounds each month since birth. The other efficiency gains have been made through technology, including growth implants with strategies to optimize their use. Also, industry consolidation has led to more comprehensive use of parasite control, mineral supplementation, good feedbunk management, optimization of rebreeding cycles and much more.\\n\\nLike most commodity production, cattle and beef are subjected to a cyclical pattern of production: a series of peaks and valleys in herd size and production that typically lasts from eight to 12 years. This cycle of production is counter-cyclical to the price. These cycles fall heaviest on the cow/calf sector, which has no real margin recourse or an ability to manage supply effectively. In beef production, large amounts of grain are fed to the animals, so the cattle cycle is affected by the price and supplies of grain as well. Today, we see the effects of foreign trade and the politics of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or more commonly, mad cow disease) dramatically influencing price. While exports generally amount to 7 percent of total beef sales, the effect on price can be dramatic and has been a significant drag on what should be a higher market at this time.\\n\\nThe cattle industry plays an integral role in the country’s economic growth and well being. More than one million cattlemen and women do business in a free-market economy and represent the largest single segment of American agriculture.\\n\\nThe 2007 U.S. Census of Agriculture found that the largest single segment of the U.S. agricultural economy is beef production, with cattle and calves representing about 21 percent of total farm sales.\\n\\nAccording to the American Farm Bureau Federation, agriculture is responsible for approximately 21 million jobs—everything from growing the food to selling it in the supermarket. Beef production itself is a major employer, with more than 186,000 full-time jobs on farms and ranches creating more than 1 million more jobs throughout the economy.\\n\\nDemand\\nBeef consumption in the United States averaged 61.2 pounds per person in 2008, down from 65 pounds in 2000 (ERS 2008). According to USDA, U.S. consumers continue to purchase more meat with a smaller proportion of disposable income, continuing the long-term trend. ERS predicts that over the next 10 years, meat purchases will decline from about 2 percent to 1.3 percent of disposable income. As of 2007, meat purchases accounted for 1.7 percent of disposable personal income and 30 percent of total food expenditures.\\n\\nA USDA study concluded that almost 65 percent of all beef was purchased at retail stores for at-home consumption. Ground beef ranked first for at-home consumption followed by steaks. On average, consumers purchased 43 pounds of beef from retail stores. Ground beef consumed at restaurants accounted for 60 percent of the beef eaten away from home. Consumers purchased more than 23 pounds of beef away from home a year.\\n\\nProduction\\nOn January 1, 2011, the inventory of U.S. beef cows was 30.9 million head, down 2 percent from January 1, 2010. Beef replacement heifers totaled 5.2 million head, down 5 percent. Cattle and calves on feed for slaughter in all feedlots totaled 14 million, up 3 percent.  (NASS 2011)\\n\\nNearly 70 percent of U.S. cattle are produced in the central region of the country, extending from North Dakota to Texas and from South Dakota to Tennessee. According to the 2007 Census of Agriculture, there were 687,540 beef cattle operations in the United States. Texas hosts the largest number of beef operations (131,769), followed by Missouri (51,289), Oklahoma (47,059) and Tennessee (42,344).\\n\\nNebraska, Iowa and Kansas host the largest number of feedlots, but Texas, Kansas, Nebraska and Colorado market the most cattle annually, that is, 5.7 million head, 5.1 million head, 4.8 million head and 1.9 million head, respectively.\\n\\nIn their U.S. Baseline Briefing Book, University of Missouri experts noted that beef demand should strengthen as the U.S. economy recovers.   \\n \\nProcessing\\nBeef production totaled 26.4 billion pounds in 2010, up 1 percent from the previous year. Commercial cattle slaughter during 2010 totaled 34.2 million head, up 3 percent from 2009. The average live weight was 1,279 pounds, down 14 pounds from a year ago. Steers comprised 49.2 percent of the total federally inspected cattle slaughter, heifers 29.8 percent, other cows 10.8 percent, dairy cows 8.3 percent and bulls 1.8 percent. \\n\\nIn their Meat and Poultry Facts 2008, AMI experts speculated that beef slaughter rates will stall, triggering a reconfiguration of the beef packing industry. A South American firm, JBS, purchased two U.S. beef packers in 2008: Swift & Company and Smithfield Beef Group. Barring further consolidation, JBS is likely to dominate the industry in the coming years.\\n\\nAccording to NASS, 632 of the 841 plants operating under federal inspection slaughtered cattle. The 14 largest plants slaughtered 55 percent of the total cattle killed in 2010. In 2006, the four largest plants slaughtered nearly 70 percent of all cattle commercially slaughtered.\\n\\nTop Ten Beef Packers\\nCompany Name and Location 	Daily Capacity\\n\\nTyson Foods, Arkansas\\n	27,375\\nJBS Swift1, Colorado 	26,050\\nCargill Meat Solutions, Kansas 	25,850\\nNational Beef Packing Co., Missouri 	13,100\\nAmerican Foods Group, Minnesota 	5,575\\nNebraska Beef, Nebraska 	3,000\\nGreater Omaha Packing, Nebraska 	2,650\\nXL Beef 	2,200\\n\\nCaviness\\n	1,700\\nCreekstone, Kansas 	1,600\\n1JBS acquired Smithfield Beef Group in October 2008.\\nSource: Meat and Poultry Facts, AMI, January 2010.\\n\\nExports\\nOverall, the U.S. beef industry exported 726,229 metric tons (MT) of beef and veal valued at $3.4 billion. Top buyers, accounting for more than half of the U.S. beef exports, were Mexico, Canada, Japan and South Korea. In 2010, Brazil and Australia exported more beef than the United States. However, these countries primarily graze their cattle on pasture rather than feed them grain.  \\n \\nFactors allowing for the upward momentum in the U.S. beef export market, according to USDA, include the weak dollar and strong economic recovery in the rest of the world, coupled with tightened supplies of competing beef. USDA estimated total U.S. beef exports for 2011 at 2.43 billion pounds or 9.3 percent of U.S. production. \\n\\nImports\\nThe United States remains a net importer of beef. According to FAS, the United States imported 768,558 MT of beef and veal valued at $2.8 billion. Canada continued to rank as the largest supplier of fresh/chilled beef into the United States in 2010, closely followed by Australia.\\n\\nCompetitive Analysis\\nIn terms of red meat expenditures in 2007, Americans spent $270.42 per person on beef (AMI). According to the USDA, U.S. consumers spent $159.37 per person on poultry that year.\\n\\nBeef has traditionally competed with the pork industry for per capita meat consumption with United States and global consumers. However, the poultry industry has increased in per capita meat consumption and the amount of disposable income spent on meat at a greater rate than beef or pork. This trend is attributed in part to the rapid development of convenient poultry products. As more and more consumers work outside the home, convenience and ease of preparation become an issue for the meat industry. Price is also a consideration. \\n\\nValue-added Opportunities\\nBecause the cyclical nature of the beef industry leads to over-supplies and depressed prices, many producers look for alternatives to market their cattle versus the traditional live commodity markets.\\n\\nOrganic Beef\\nDuring the 1990s, organic farming became one of the fastest growing segments of U.S. agriculture. The United States had 43,782 beef cattle certified organic in 2008, up from 20,285 beef cows in 2003. USDA organic standards were implemented in 2002. The United States had 1.85 million acres of pasture and rangeland certified organic in 2008. \\n\\nWhy the large increase in organic beef? Many producers feel it is a good way to lower input costs, decrease reliance on nonrenewable resources, capture high-value markets with premium prices and boost farm income. Organic beef production is based on a system of farming that maintains and replenishes soil fertility without the use of pesticides and fertilizers. Organic beef is minimally processed without artificial ingredients, preservatives or irradiation. For more information on organic beef, please see the Organic Beef section of the Web site.\\n \\nNatural Beef\\nNatural does not have the same strict interpretation as organic does. According to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, all fresh meat qualifies as “natural,” but those labeled “natural” cannot contain any artificial flavor or flavoring, coloring ingredient, chemical preservatives or any other artificial or synthetic ingredient; and the product and its ingredients are not more than minimally processed (ground, for example). Some companies promote their beef as natural because the cattle were not exposed to antibiotics or hormones and were totally raised on a range instead of being “finished” in a feedlot.\\n\\nResearch conducted at Kansas State University has shown that consumers tended to associate natural beef with local, family farms and perceived an increased value from that aspect. Research shows that some suburban, higher income consumers in some regions are willing to pay more for natural beef cuts from the loin. This is a growing market but still a small percentage of total U.S. meat sales.\\n \\nFor more information on natural beef, please see the Natural Beef section of the Web site.\\n \\nBranded/Certified/Verified\\nTraceability, tracking the product from its origin through processing, is becoming a competitive advantage to today’s meat suppliers. Product quality attributes or the actual manufacturing process is verified or certified by a third party.\\n\\nSuch programs may become increasingly important as the food industry makes further attempts to appeal to the social consciousness of consumers. According to USDA, the top three U.S. restaurant franchises place restrictions on how animals used in the companies’ foods are produced, accounting for approximately 35 percent of franchised restaurant sales.\\n\\nFor more information, please visit the Branded/Certified/Verified section of the Web site.\\n \\nDirect Market Beef\\nDirect marketing is selling food and farm products directly to consumers without using an intermediary. This may include direct sales to grocery stores, restaurants, door-to-door and freezer sales and Internet marketing.\\n\\nDirect marketing of livestock products is not as common as other vegetables and melons, for example, because livestock require further processing. The percentage of farms with direct sales was higher in more urbanized counties.\\n\\nHowever, direct marketing can provide prices for producers higher than typical wholesale prices, yet below supermarket prices. Interest in food safety, the environment and alternative agriculture has also supported this growth. Consumers enjoy dealing face-to-face with the producers of the products they are purchasing.\\n\\n\\n"Pastured, or free range, poultry" refers to a poultry production system that is characterized by chickens, turkeys or ducks being raised primarily on pasture. The birds supplement their grain feed by foraging for up to 20 percent of their intake and are often moved regularly to fresh pasture.\\n\\nPastured poultry is a niche market that taps into increased consumer demand for more natural and humanely raised protein sources. Consumers demanding this type of poultry product are generally willing to pay more for the system, which includes raising poultry on grassy pasture to deliver a product that is considered by many consumers to be healthier and tastier, as well as more environmentally sound. Pastured poultry production generally has lower entry costs and thus is attractive to smaller or limited resource farmers.\\n\\nMarketing\\nPastured poultry also taps into the growing natural foods market. Like the natural foods market, the certified organic food market is quite similar in terms of consumer demands and characteristics. The Food Marketing Institute found that 59 percent of consumers look for and purchase products labeled as natural, and 37 percent look for and purchase products labeled as organic. Nutrition Business Journal estimated “natural” and organic food and beverage sales reached $28.2 billion in 2006, a 14.1 percent increase from 2005. However, the same publication found that organic meat sales were 24 percent of the total. While not all pastured poultry is certified organic, comparing the markets can be helpful in determining overall general tendencies in consumer demand.\\n\\nFoods with a "natural" label had $22.3 billion in sales in 2008, according to "Healthy Eating Report for 2008" from the Nielsen Company, New York. The organic food industry, meanwhile, grew to more than $28.6 million in 2010, according to the Organic Trade Association.\\n\\nFarmers' markets are being used as an important marketing outlet for many smaller direct marketing poultry producers. Producers often receive their highest prices at these markets, followed by restaurants. Retail and other sales return the lowest prices.\\n\\nSmall-scale producers sold nearly 50 percent of their chickens directly from their farm. Large-scale producers, defined as producers raising more than 4,000 chickens a year, sold a greater proportion of their chickens to restaurants and retail outlets. \\n\\nThis growth trend in farmers' markets supports the growing consumer demand for direct-marketed, small-scale production techniques such as free range or pastured poultry. For instance, farmers' market consumers are requesting more information about how products were grown and if they were grown organically. According to a 2004 Economic Research Service (ERS) publication, when 210 farmers' market managers were polled, customers with a strong demand for organic products were also interested in environmental and social issues within agriculture, including sustainable development, environmental pollution and wildlife protection. These factors support expanded marketing opportunities for small-scale poultry production such as pastured and free range.\\n\\nPastured meat products and the growth of that market can also be attributed to the fact that a growing number of consumers support smaller farmers, are opposed to livestock raised in confinement and have a set of values that prefer animal products resulting from a pastured system.\\n\\nIn its "America’s Changing Appetite: Food Consumption and Spending to 2020" report, the Economic Research Service (ERS 2002) concluded that U.S. consumers would be demanding more quality due to increased population and an increase in educational attainment and wealth. Quality purchases look at differentiated products and include foods marketed with specific production techniques such as pastured poultry, for instance. Consumers are demanding higher quality, healthy foods, and they are increasingly demanding to know that their food is safe. They also want assurances from agricultural producers, retailers and foodservice workers about how the food was grown and what production techniques were used.\\n\\nAccording to the same ERS study, total poultry purchases are expected to have market growth of 19 percent for at-home meals and 18 percent for away-from-home meals. If specific qualities such as environmental concerns and animal welfare continue to gain consumer support, these types of production systems will provide a growing market for pastured poultry producers.\\n\\nDemand\\nAccording to the National Chicken Council, U.S. consumption of chicken steadily increased from 2000 until peaking at 87.7 pounds per person in 2006. Chicken consumption was 83.8 pounds per person in 2009. Chicken has passed beef and is currently the most consumed meat.\\n\\nProduction\\nThe many management alternatives available to poultry producers are as follows:\\n\\n    * Portable houses\\n    * Pasture pens\\n    * Integrated systems\\n\\nThousands of small farms in the United States and worldwide produce what is called "pastured poultry." To these farmers, pastured poultry means chickens and other poultry raised right on top of living grasses. As long as they get all the grass they want, poultry can qualify to be called grass fed. This is accomplished by keeping the birds in low, wide, bottomless cages called "chicken tractors" that are moved to a new spot of fresh pasture once or more often each day.\\n\\nThe term grass-fed poultry is a larger group, of which the pastured birds are a sub-set. Among producers, grass-fed poultry means birds that are allowed to forage on as much living grasses as they desire, whether in chicken tractors, small coops surrounded by pasture, or the exclusive French "Label Rouge," or Red Label, birds.\\n\\nThe Label Rouge System\\nFor people seeking ways to increase the profit potential of free range poultry systems as a full-time enterprise, the new “Label Rouge” approach may hold promise. Popular in France since the mid-1960s, the “red label” system produces free range poultry on a larger scale and takes advantage of direct marketing opportunities. In France, Label Rouge chickens have captured 33 percent of the poultry market. Label Rouge enterprises offer independence, use lower densities of birds per housing unit, allow flock access to pasture, discourage routine medication and feature longer life spans–12 weeks–for broilers and other meat birds to reach market weight. The longer life of the birds has become a chief marketing point, along with a flavor Label Rouge proponents claim is superior. Because the Label Rouge bird is not a typical American Cornish Cross breed, because it lives longer and because, after processing, it is cooled through air chilling, people consistently notice a taste difference. Air chilling discourages cross-contamination because carcasses are hung and chilled separately rather than lying in contact in a water bath, and flavor is not compromised by chlorine, typically added to chill water in poultry processing plants to kill bacteria and other microbes.\\n\\nWhile a farmer may not be able to produce as many of these flocks per season, charging considerably more for each bird boosts profits. For more information on Label Rouge, go to http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/labelrouge.html.\\n \\nPastured poultry generally commands higher prices; therefore, the potential for profit is higher than with conventional, confinement poultry. Under this system, poultry is usually sold locally, with only minimal processing. Broilers sell for between $1.50 and $2.50 per pound, dressed weight. Turkeys sell between $1.75 and $2.50 per pound. Prices vary among producers. The price difference often depends on whether the birds are sold from the chill tank, or are bagged, weighed, labeled and ready for the freezer. Production costs are usually about 1/2 to 2/3 the sale price. Many producers do not add their labor into production costs. It is the most commonly used pasture poultry method at present.\\n \\nFree range has been practiced for a century or more. This system fell out of favor in the 1960s due to disease and predator inroads, and was mostly replaced by commercial confinement poultry production. Free Range generally means a fenced pasture surrounding the barn or poultry shelter.\\n\\nIntegrated systems focus on services that poultry can provide, such as fertilization, tillage and insect and weed control rather than only meat production. Various species of domestic animals are raised together to complement each other. Disease cycles can be broken when the same species does not occupy the same site all of the time.\\n\\nChickens need protection and shade outdoors, such as trees and bush plantings. In fact, they may not venture outdoors without it. United Kingdom studies of free range poultry suggest that the amount of sun and the time of day have the greatest impact on chicken behavior. Chickens were most active during partial sun and during the morning and late afternoon.\\n\\nChickens obtain limited nutrients from forage plants, although eggs from hens raised on legumes and grass have more omega 3 fatty acids and vitamins than eggs from hens raised only on grass. Worms and insects provide high-quality nutrients, but research suggests that modern broilers need adequate nutrients and feed supplementation.\\n\\nOne limitation of pastured poultry: in cooler climates, the birds can only be raised during the summer and early fall months. Another limitation, especially for large-scale pastured poultry operations, is labor requirements. Many tasks, such as watering and feeding, must be done by hand.  \\n\\nOften, pastured poultry is one enterprise of many for producers.\\n\\nProcessing\\nOne major concern for many producers is processing--both the availability of licensed processors and the quality of the processing. To sell across state lines, producers must have their poultry butchered at a federally inspected plant. To sell within their state, producers need only have their poultry butchered at a state-inspected plant. A thorough understanding of the appropriate state and federal laws regarding poultry processing and sales is vital for each pastured poultry producer.\\n\\nAdditionally, with global concerns over avian influenza and other livestock diseases, pastured poultry producers should be familiar with poultry diseases, their symptoms and any relevant reporting procedures surrounding disease outbreaks.\\n\\nGovernment/Regulatory Involvement\\nThe USDA does not currently have specific regulatory definitions for free range although the term is allowed on labels under certain conditions. When applying for label approval, the producer must submit a brief description of the housing, which the USDA reviews to determine that poultry have access to the outdoors for at least half their lives. In contrast, the European Union defines free range, specifying maximum stocking density, type of feed, minimum slaughter age and amount of space to go outside.\\n\\n\\nU.S. Cattle and Beef Industry,

'''Default Nullification'''\\n\\nDefined.\\n\\n[[Default Nullification]] is a state constitutional amendment or legislation that automatically nullifies all federal laws and regulations until said state's legislature can take up the issue to adopt, approve, and fund, or not.  If adoption is not achieved, non-compliance (and non-funding) is the circumstance.\\n\\nDefault Nullification is a political trend developing in states across the nation in response to the rampant spending, corruption, and unresponsiveness found in Washington D.C.  Enactment of this measure would achieve the following:\\n\\n1. It would restore genuine Constitutional governance by requiring state legislatures to cease and desist in abrogating their Constitutional governing responsibilities to D.C.\\n\\n2. It would require all special interests and lobbyists in D.C. to spread out over 50 different geographical locations across the country to petition citizens for favor and taxes. \\n\\n3. It would promote genuine state diversity throughout the nation, thereby optimizing competition between states for the nation's citizens.\\n\\n4. It would have the effect of defunding and reducing governing authority in Washington D.C. \\n\\n5. Would offer the greatest opportunity for a permanent, constitutional "fix" for the Washington problem, as nullification is largely immune to Federal court rulings. States are not required to obtain federal court approval to enact nullification rights according to Article One, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, and also of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.
==Course description==\\n\\nWhy, in the midst of great affluence, are people poor, and in some cases, persistently so?  This question has captured the imagination of social scientists and social critics for over one century.  In this course, we will become intimate with some of the key theoretical, critical, and empirical writings that seek to provide insight into this enduring problem.  In the process, seminar participants will become familiar with the key issues and debates animating discussions of American sociologists: Is there a culture of poverty?  Why does poverty persist in the face of economic growth?  What accounts for the feminization and juvenilization of poverty?  Does government intervention help, or does it just make matters worse?  As seminar participants deepen their knowledge in these areas, they will learn to identify and interrogate key assumptions driving these interventions and the evolution of the field, generally, and hopefully they will begin to offer critical perspectives of their own.
Inboxication is the overwhelming feeling and resulting stress associated with the challenge of keeping up with all the information from our inboxes and the all too common addiction to these inboxes. Studies have shown that constant interruptions caused by the bleeps of our mobile phones and email systems are causing Constant Partial Attention (CPA). The increase in the number of emails recieved daily combined with the multitude of communications channels such as SMS, IM and social networking mediums is increasing the impact of Data Smog and resulting in more Information Fatigue Syndrome. More and more people are exhibiting signs of Attention Deficit Trait(ADT) as they struggle to maintain focus and reduce stress.
\\nTechnology is the making, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The word technology comes from Greek τεχνολογία (technología); from τέχνη (téchnē), meaning "art, skill, craft", and -λογία (-logía), meaning "study of-".[1] The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include construction technology, medical technology, and information technology.\\nThe human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.\\nTechnology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of the Earth and its environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.\\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.

Diversity Design is a new form of socially responsible design discipline defined by Dragan Loncar. Like ecological design that helps sustainability of the environment, or design that helps people with special needs, this form of design helps with inclusion of people marginalised by race, gender and sexual orientation. It is a subtle and non-intrusive intervention on consumer products packaging and POS to invite these minorities into the mainstream of society. As an intelligent design, it could be shy in less tolerant societies, and it could reveal itself in full glory where its features appear to be advantageous. Sometimes, with its accidental use, situations filled with light humour could arise and make otherwise unaware people think positively about diversity in nature. It also encourages conscious individuals to express their love of diversity, and therefore stretch brand's target audience to the widest corners of society. This kind of social awareness through design can create huge benefits both to businesses and community, since it's generating free publicity, otherwise hardly obtainable in this highly competitive world.

Litter can also be used as a verb. To litter means to throw (often man-made) objects onto the ground and leave them unremoved, as opposed to disposing of them properly.\\n\\nIt is a human impact on the environment and is a serious environmental issue in many countries. Litter can exist in the environment for long periods of time before degrading and be transported large distances into the world's oceans. Litter can affect quality of life.\\n\\nCigarette butts are the most littered item in the world, with 4.5 trillion discarded annually. The cellulose acetate butts are not biodegradable and, as a result, their chemical decomposition can take many decades.[1]
A Conjoined Wealth Fund (CWF) is a relatively small privately-owned investment fund or group of funds composed of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, property, precious metals or other financial instruments. Conjoined wealth funds invest funds globally to take advantage of the global growth and opportunities; however, they keep a strict domestic reinvestment mission in order to subsidize depleted governmental revenues. \\n\\nSome conjoined wealth funds are held solely by a non-profit or faith based organization, who accumulate the funds in the course of their management existing missions and donor initiatives of a small community; this type of fund is usually of major economic and fiscal importance to the region. Other conjoined wealth funds are simply the savings small for-profit businesses that depend heavily on a local community, invested by various entities for the purposes of investment return, and which may not have significant role in fiscal management.\\n\\nThe accumulated funds are used to prop up local communities too dense to receive the highest quality of goods and services a sovereign nation has to offer, as well as sparse communities that present obvious and long standing tax anomalies. While conjoined wealth funds engage the global equity markets, their core investment focus is assisting the state to create self sufficient communities and cities.
== '''scope of physics''' ==\\n\\nPhysics is closely related to the other natural sciences and, in a sense, encompasses them. Chemistry, for example, deals with the interaction of atoms to form molecules; much of modern geology is largely a study of the physics of the earth and is known as geophysics; and astronomy deals with the physics of the stars and outer space. Even living systems are made up of fundamental particles and, as studied in biophysics and biochemistry, they follow the same types of laws as the simpler particles traditionally studied by a physicist.\\n\\nThe emphasis on the interaction between particles in modern physics, known as the microscopic approach, must often be supplemented by a macroscopic approach that deals with larger elements or systems of particles. This macroscopic approach is indispensable to the application of physics to much of modern technology. Thermodynamics, for example, a branch of physics developed during the 19th century, deals with the elucidation and measurement of properties of a system as a whole and remains useful in other fields of physics; it also forms the basis of much of chemical and mechanical engineering. Such properties as the temperature, pressure, and volume of a gas have no meaning for an individual atom or molecule; these thermodynamic concepts can only be applied directly to a very large system of such particles. A bridge exists, however, between the microscopic and macroscopic approach; another branch of physics, known as statistical mechanics, indicates how pressure and temperature can be related to the motion of atoms and molecules on a statistical basis
Laser Safety \\n \\nDirect eye contact with the output beam from the laser will cause serious damage and possible blindness.\\nThe safe use of lasers requires that all laser users, and everyone near the laser system, are aware of the dangers involved. The safe use of the laser depends upon the user being familiar with the instrument and the characteristics of laser light.\\nIf the laser beam is reflected or scattered from various objects, it is very dangerous. Avoid physical contact with the laser beam. The high spectral intensity and short wavelength may cause tissue damage which is not immediately evident.\\n\\n \\nDo not permit any reflective object in the path of the beam. Scattering the beam from a reflective surface can be very damaging to the eyes or skin.\\n \\nBlock the beam when not in use.\\n \\nTurn the beam off, preventing stray reflections from occurring either between experiments or when moving the laser.\\n \\nIf possible, have an enclosed path for the laser beam.\\n \\nAlways point the laser at a specific target, such as a power meter.\\n \\nLimit access to the laser to qualified users who are familiar with laser safety practices and who are aware of the dangers involved.\\n \\nPost warning signs indicating the laser is being used.\\n \\nNever point the laser beam at anyone's' eyes.\\nCDRH (Center for Devices & Radiological Health)\\nA department of the United States Food and Drug Administration, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health establishes the safety regulations and requirements governing the manufacture of lasers and laser devices within the United States, along with many other responsibilities.
\\n                        \\n== '''THERMAL POLLUTION''' ==\\n\\n\\nThermal pollution is the degradation of water quality by any process that changes ambient water temperature. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. When water used as a coolant is returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature, the change in temperature impacts organisms by (a) decreasing oxygen supply, and (b) affecting ecosystem composition. Urban runoff--stormwater discharged to surface waters from roads and parking lots--can also be a source of elevated water temperatures.\\n\\nWhen a power plant first opens or shuts down for repair, fish and other organisms adapted to particular temperature range can be killed by the abrupt rise in water temperature known as 'thermal shock'.\\n\\nThermal pollution can also be caused by the release of very cold water from the base of reservoirs into warmer rivers. This affects fish (particularly their eggs and larvae), macroinvertebrates and river productivity.\\n\\nContents [hide]\\n1 Ecological effects — warm water \\n2 Ecological effects — cold water \\n3 Control of thermal pollution \\n4 See also \\n5 References \\n \\n\\n\\n[edit] Ecological effects — warm water\\nElevated temperature typically decreases the level of dissolved oxygen (DO) in water. The decrease in levels of DO can harm aquatic animals such as fish, amphibians and copepods. Thermal pollution may also increase the metabolic rate of aquatic animals, as enzyme activity, resulting in these organisms consuming more food in a shorter time than if their environment were not changed. An increased metabolic rate may result in food source shortages, causing a sharp decrease in a population. Changes in the environment may also result in a migration of organisms to another, more suitable environment, and to in-migration of fishes that normally only live in warmer waters elsewhere. This leads to competition for fewer resources; the more adapted organisms moving in may have an advantage over organisms that are not used to the warmer temperature. As a result one has the problem of compromising food chains of the old and new environments. Biodiversity can be decreased as a result.\\n\\n \\nFish killed in receiving watersIt is known that temperature changes of even one to two degrees Celsius can cause significant changes in organism metabolism and other adverse cellular biology effects. Principal adverse changes can include rendering cell walls less permeable to necessary osmosis, coagulation of cell proteins, and alteration of enzyme metabolism. These cellular level effects can adversely affect mortality and reproduction.\\n\\nPrimary producers are affected by warm water because higher water temperature increases plant growth rates, resulting in a shorter lifespan and species overpopulation. This can cause an algae bloom which reduces the oxygen levels in the water. The higher plant density leads to an increased plant respiration rate because the reduced light intensity decreases photosynthesis. This is similar to the eutrophication that occurs when watercourses are polluted with leached agricultural inorganic fertilizers.\\n\\nA large increase in temperature can lead to the denaturing of life-supporting enzymes by breaking down hydrogen- and disulphide bonds within the quaternary structure of the enzymes. Decreased enzyme activity in aquatic organisms can cause problems such as the inability to break down lipids, which leads to malnutrition.\\n\\nIn limited cases, warm water has little deleterious effect and may even lead to improved function of the receiving aquatic ecosystem. This phenomenon is seen especially in seasonal waters and is known as thermal enrichment. An extreme case is derived from the aggregational habits of the manatee, which often uses power plant discharge sites during winter. Projections suggest that manatee populations would decline upon the removal of these discharges.\\n\\nThe temperature can be as high as 70° Fahrenheit for freshwater, 80° F for saltwater, and 85° F for tropical fish.[clarification needed]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Ecological effects — cold water\\nReleases of unnaturally cold water from reservoirs can dramatically change the fish and macroinvertebrate fauna of rivers, and reduce river productivity. In Australia, where many rivers have warmer temperature regimes, native fish species have been eliminated, and macroinvertebrate fauna have been drastically altered and impoverished. The temperatures for freshwater fish can be as low as 50° F, saltwater 75° F, and tropical 80° F.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Control of thermal pollution\\n \\nCooling tower at Gustav Knepper Power Station, Dortmund, GermanyIndustrial wastewater\\nIn the United States, thermal pollution from industrial sources is generated mostly by power plants, petroleum refineries, pulp and paper mills, chemical plants, steel mills and smelters.[2] [3] Heated water from these sources may be controlled with:\\n\\ncooling ponds, man-made bodies of water designed for cooling by evaporation, convection, and radiation \\ncooling towers, which transfer waste heat to the atmosphere through evaporation and/or heat transfer \\ncogeneration, a process where waste heat is recycled for domestic and/or industrial heating purposes. \\nSome facilities use once-through cooling (OTC) systems which do not reduce temperature as effectively as the above systems. For example, the Potrero Generating Station in San Francisco, which uses OTC, discharges water to San Francisco Bay approximately 10° C (20° F) above the ambient bay temperature.[4]\\n\\n\\nUrban runoff\\nDuring warm weather, urban runoff can have significant thermal impacts on small streams, as stormwater passes over hot parking lots, roads and sidewalks. Stormwater management facilities that absorb runoff or direct it into groundwater, such as bioretention systems and infiltration basins, can reduce these thermal effects. Retention basins tend to be less effective at reducing temperature, as the water may be heated by the sun before being discharged to a receiving stream.[5]\\n\\n\\n[edit] See also\\nWater cooling \\nWater pollution \\nWater quality \\n\\n[edit] References\\n^ Selna, Robert (2009).

The temperature change can be upwards or downwards. \\nThe major sources of thermal pollution are power plants and industrial factories. In most power plants, heat is produced when coal, oil, or natural gas is burned or nuclear fuels undergo fission to release huge amounts of energy. \\nThis heat turns water to steam, which spins turbines to produce electricity. After cooling the used steam must be cooled and condensed back into water. To condense the steam, cool water is brought into the plant and circulated next to the hot steam. In this process, the water used for cooling increases 5 to 10 Celsius degrees.\\nIndustries such as metalworking use large amounts of water as coolant, and then release this water back into a nearby source, such as a lake or river. The released water then has a \\nhigher water temperature than the source of water, which then increases the temperature of that particular body of water. This affects the Aquatic organisms, as they are extremely sensitive to temperature change, in which when subject to this temperature change, like many other animals and plants pose the risk of dying of Thermal Shock.\\nIf these organisms die in that particular body of water, it poses a threat of disrupting/damaging the food chain, potentially leading to many other animals dying from starvation or in other instances overpopulation.

In particular, the institution is committed towards addressing the shortcomings existing in the sustainable energy sector in India, viz. lack of policy support and incentives, lack of legislative and research support, lack of qualified manpower, and lack of critical awareness that would lead to the transition to a sustainable energy-based economy. Since its inception, WISE has pioneered several initiatives for accelerating the development of sustainable energy in the country.
\\n\\nMusical Characteristics of Rap Hip-hop culture, once confined to the streets has broken into the commercial realm with force. Hip hop records top the charts week after week, rap videos have taken control of MTV, BET and the BOX, and there are dozens of hip hop magazines on the newsstands. A stroll on any city street in the United States reveals the proliferation of hip-hop styled apparel. The culture itself had much humbler beginnings, however. On the street corners and in the parks, young men and women battled through freestyle rhymes and dance moves. Whatever the time period, and whoever he MC may have been, Rap has incorporated, and included several of the “classical” musical characteristics present in most western music today. These characteristics have influenced the popularity of this genre from coast to coast; as well as, giving the music a chance to penetrate into the homes of a vast array of people (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc.). When one is referring to certain musical characteristics, pitch, dynamics, timbre, rhythm, melody, harmony, key, texture, form, and various others are usually mentioned. It is fascinating to see how many of these characteristics are present in the hip-hop culture, more specifical.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe loves to dance rap write songs and acting.com

B.G. Burkett, however, ignores the statistics of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Almost all legitimate sources state that a significant number of Vietnam combat veterans suffer from some degree of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Perhaps the most recent and most accurate of the study of these veterans, their pyschological disorders and consequences are described in Dr. Jonathans Shay's two highly accalimed books "Achilles in Vietnam" and "Odysseus in America." The treatment of Vietnam Veterans by both pro and anti-war groups, and the population in general, upon their return to America and the cultural milieu into which they re-entered caused a host of profound complex and often debilitating consequences for these veterans. Many of these veterans, almost forty years later, still carry the weight of these disorders and do not fully participate in the mainstream of American society. Rather they remain as "outliers" unable to comprehend why American society has rejected them.
\\n== World War III ==\\nThe nuclear war started in the Northern Hemisphere and lasted for thirty-nine days. Newspapers and radio stations had ceased operations during the war, so many people were left without knowledge of how or why everything started. Yet what was truly occurring was that Albania had initiated an Arab-Israeli war, which led to a Russia-NATO war, which led to a Russo-Chinese war. Atomic bombs fell all over the Northern Hemisphere.\\n== The Left-over Radiation ==\\n The radiation is spreading south steadily. The wind currents a slowly blowing the radiation to the Southern Hemisphere even though all the bombs were dropped in the Northern Hemisphere, thousands of miles away.There is simply nothing that can be done to stop the wind currents. The equatorial trade winds slow down the radiation but do not completely stop it from drifting. It is estimated that once the radiation has started spreading, it would take six months, give or take 3 months, for the radiation to fully take over the Southern Hemisphere as it has in the Northern Hemisphere.

It is true that during that\\ntime period the most powerful countries in Europe tended not to fight with\\neach other. This tranquility contrasted strongly with the era of the French\\nRevolution and Napoleon (1789–1815), when large numbers of Europeans\\nfought and died for the sake of their nations and empires. By comparison, the\\nperiod from 1815 to 1914 does seem relatively tranquil. The relative absence\\nof warfare between nations allowed for a major burst in industrialization and\\ntechnological development, which resulted in disruptions, to be sure, even\\nas the overall standard of living rose in most places.\\nYet this era cannot honestly be described as an era of complete tranquility.\\nIn the middle of the century, major conflicts were associated with the\\nunification of the German and Italian nations. In response to the forces of\\nnationalism, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire fought\\nto stave off disintegration. Meanwhile, Britain and France—and to a lesser\\ndegree Germany, Italy, Japan, Portugal, and the United States—expanded\\ntheir empires overseas. For the most part, their colonies were obtained by\\nshedding the blood of the native inhabitants and, to a lesser extent, the\\nblood of their own soldiers.\\nThe building of nations, empires, and industries was the main feature of\\nEuropean, Japanese, and U.S. history in the period from 1850 to 1914. The\\ntimes seemed peaceful from the perspective of the industrializing countries,\\nbut much of the rest of the world found itself dominated by force.

Project R&R: Release and Restitution for Chimpanzees is NEAVS’ national campaign to end the use of chimpanzees in invasive biomedical research and provide them permanent release and restitution in sanctuary. The historic work of Project R&R will lead to the first non-human species being afforded legal protection from use in harmful research. \\n\\nThe U.S. is the only remaining country to hold large numbers of chimpanzees in laboratories.  Even in the U.S., their use in active protocols has steadily declined due to ethical concerns, the enormous expense of using and housing them in laboratories, and the scientific limitations and failures of the chimpanzee as a model for humans. Yet U.S. labs confine some 1,065 chimpanzees.
Saving the valuable resources of earth.....\\n\\nTime v/s effective utilization of Natural resources\\n\\nWith the growing generation gap & 'time is money' attitude, no one thinks how important natural resources are. Our lives have become so luxurious that we rarely think about saving the precious resources of earth...We do not realise that the luxuries (commodities that save human energy & time) we get are sometimes (actually most of the times) are at the cost of destroying our natural resources & we take them for granted either knowingly or unknowingly. In fact these luxuries make man forget how to use/ save natural resources effectively. However there have been significant efforts in creating awareness through various mediums and forums. \\n \\nFor instance: This years noble peace prize is awarded jointly to the UN sponsored Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change ( IPCC ) and Albert Arnold Gore Jr, the ex-vice president of USA for their effort to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundation for the measures that are needed to counteract such changes. This very recognition brings home the point that such issues have assumed very serious proportions now and every stake holder has to take notice of the same and do the needful at their end.\\n\\nSo, what are we all waiting for....Go Green!!  Save earth. \\n\\nYour small effort to save natural resources can make a huge difference to the world...
'''Transnational Governance'''\\n\\nThe concept of transnational governance is seen by many as a rather new category of governance. But it’s not because few or no literature are available on a precise topics that this topics didn’t exist. \\n\\nThe amount of literature around governance become more and more big but nothing is still available on transnational governance.\\n\\nReach good transnational governance could lead to real economic, social  improvements as well as alleviating poverty,  eliminating illiteracy or reducing infant and maternal mortality in deprived area. These transnational improvements could be much easier to reach if the countries involved in this kind of multi-national area share a common identity.\\n\\nThus, the idea of common identity could have a central place in the definition of transnational governance.
 \\nMousa Bani Baker \\nA PhD candidate in the faculty of Engineering and Computer Science- Concordia University-Montreal, specializing in Geo-environmental engineering. My research is focused on protecting the environment and more specifically on designing a new liner material to protect the ground water table from toxic materials. It amazed me to learn that fresh water represents only 3.5% of the Earth’s total water. Of that 3.5%, two-thirds is ground water. Protecting this resource from toxic chemicals is incredibly important and is why I am committed to pursuing research in this area. Since my childhood I have been involved with environmental activism, beginning with volunteering for clubs and moving on to research and professional work as I got older. I am a strong believer that we have the responsibility to teach our children and raise their awareness about environmental issues. During my spare time I enjoy teaching children English as a second language, mathematics and physics.
The purpose of this policy, known as the “Canary Initiative” is to drastically reduce Aspen’s carbon footprint. Because of Aspen’s high-end reputation, the carbon level this city emits is significantly higher than a similar-sized city. The initiative received its name from the idea that Aspen’s climate is a “canary in a coal mine”; that is, Aspen's climate could be significantly altered by events and changes from outside areas. Aspen is a popular resort destination for its ski mountains, and tourism is a key component in the business Aspen receives. However, with rising global temperatures, Aspen’s snow is estimated to disappear entirely by 2100. In order to prevent irreversible damage to the natural environment, while sustaining and developing Aspen's economy, this city-wide initiative was created. The initiative calls for: a greenhouse gas emissions inventory, an assessment of impacts of global and local climate change, an education and action plan for advocacy on regional, state, and national levels. \\n\\n'''Aspen’s 2000 IPCC Report'''\\n\\nIn 2000, the city of Aspen and the Aspen Skiing Company launched a study of the effects of rising temperatures on Aspen and the surrounding mountains. Using state-of the art climate prediction models, as well as unique physical and geographical data for Aspen, the report illustrated the consequences of various actions of humankind. The following data is from the results of the study. In the low emissions scenario (global greenhouse gas levels peak at or around 500 ppm), Aspen was expected to experience about 6 degrees F of warming by 2100, giving Aspen a climate more similar to Los Alamos, New Mexico. Under the “business as usual” scenario, GHG levels would peak around 700 ppm, and Aspen would experience 14 degrees F of warming by 2100, giving it a climate more like Amarillo, Texas. In both of these scenarios, Aspen’s snowpack is dramatically reduced; in the “business-as-usual” scenario the snowpack is virtually non-existent by 2100. Because of the alarming results of the IPCC report, Aspen and the Aspen Skiing Company quickly mobilized to clean up—their business depends on it. Several adverse effects on the spring runoff and ecosystems of Aspen were also mentioned, most notably the peak spring discharge occurring earlier in the year, and an increase of summer droughts. \\n\\n'''Greenhouse Gas Reductions'''\\n\\nIn 2005, the City of Aspen made and signed a legally-binding contract to reduce its GHG emissions by at least 1% every year. By the end of 2006 Aspen had reduced its emissions by 11.5%, and new, more stringent community reduction goals were made. The Canary Initiative requires GHG emissions to be cut by 30% (from 2004 levels) by 2020, and 80% reduction by mid-century.\\n\\n'''Canary Action Plan'''\\n\\nThe Canary Action Plan details the emission cuts or general improvements that need to be made in several sectors of business.

'''    The uniqueness of Ayurveda, science of life, lies in its positive approach to life. Life is for living fully, fulfilling one, for which both sound health and a normal life span are indispensable. Ill health and a short span of life are negation to life. Ayurveda therefore insists on an understanding, by man of his relationship with nature and society he lives in, and of his living in harmony with both. Ayurveda works not only as a simple health care system, but a lifestyle able to maintain the body in perfect harmony with nature. It gives prime importance to individuals as a whole in his physical, mental and spiritual levels considering his condition, temperament, environment and even habits to design the healing process as well as enabling him for a healthy living. The promotive, preventive, corrective and curative aspects of healthcare and the medicines possessing such properties are indeed the strength of Ayurveda.\\n\\n   Heart disease has earned the reputation of being a merciless killer, which robs the human life in its prime. Its blow either proves fatal or causes considerable disability. It is one of the most serious maladies, not only in western countries, but also in the east. The incidence of this dreaded disease is rising and in recent years it has become the greatest menace to mankind.\\n\\n   Although extensive work has been done in modern medicine in the diagnosis and management of Heart diseases, efforts on the prevention of the disease in the population is still unsatisfactory. This is an area in which there is a definite scope for Ayurveda, by the modification of risk factors aiming at prevention of heart diseases.
== Waste Free Oceans (WFO) ==\\n\\nWaste Free Oceans is an industry-led initiative with the aim of reducing floating marine debris on Europe’s coastlines and waters by 2020.Using existing fishing trawls and new technology, WFO will engage Europe’s fishing community in cleaning up floating marine debris and bring it back to land for recycling and sorting. The time has come to act together in tackling this growing problem and ensuring the health and purity of Europe’s coastal waters.\\n\\n\\n\\n'''An Industry led European-wide initiative to clean up Coastal waters in Europe.'''\\n\\nThere are many factors that have contributed to a rise in marine litter: poor waste management practices in ports and marinas, dumping by ships and vessels, not to mention\\ngeneral public attitudes towards littering are all reasons for this growing problem. The implications of an increase in marine litter are far reaching - affecting both human health and the ecosystem. Although this is a global issue it is time for Europe to show leadership in solving this problem. \\n\\n\\n'''Willingness to provide solutions'''\\n\\nThe Waste Free Oceans Foundation has initiated this marine litter project in order to provide a solution to the problem of floating marine debris. Boats outfitted with a special trawl will be able to collect between 2-8 tones of waste (per trawl) for cleaning & recycling.Using the knowledge of fishermen and homegrown technology, the project aims to educate all stakeholders in tackling debris on Europe’s coastlines and waters by 2020.\\n\\n<ref>www.wastefreeoceans.eu</ref>
I WAS ASKED TO DO THIS BY SOME PEOPLE IN FORM 2 IN SVGS\\nTHIS WAS A GEOGRAPHY ASSIGNMENT GIVEN TO THEM AND \\nPEOPLE DID NOT KNOW THE ANSWERS SO I AM GIVING YOU THEM \\nYOU ARE WELCOME AND ALSO GIVE JAVID A DOLLAR IF U ARE IN GRAMMER SCHOOL\\n\\nHOW ACTIVE IS IT?\\n\\nOver the years there have been a number of activities affecting the earth.  The movement of the earth’s plates\\n have resulted In Volcanic eruptions, Earthquakes and Tsunamis. Many lives have been lost and the geographic \\nfeatures of the earth’s surface have been altered significantly.\\nThe advancement of technology have allowed us to predict many of these occurrences and helped us to better\\n prepare by choosing where we live or where we build homes and structures that can withstand some of the effects \\nof what we now know as ‘natural disasters’.\\nThere are various sites and locations on earth that are noted for earth activities, while others are noted for its peace \\nand tranquillity.\\nThis is due to the movement of the earth’s tectonic plates. Countries such as Japan, Hawaii, California, Haiti, and \\nNew Zealand are noted for there volcanic eruptions and earthquakes while others such as St. Vincent and the Grenadines,\\nBarbados, St. Lucia are rated for there resilience to earth activity and have fewer instances of earth movement that result \\nin catastrophic damages.\\n\\n\\nWAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE MONITOR AND PREPARE FOR EARTHQUAKE ACTIVITY\\n\\nEarthquakes are not as easy to predict as volcanic eruptions. However, there are still some ways of monitoring the chances\\nof an earthquake:\\n•	A seismometer is used to pick up the vibrations in the Earth’s crust.  An increase in vibrations may indicate a possible \\n       earthquake.\\nRadon Gas escapes from cracks in the Earth’s crust.  Levels of radon gas can be monitored – a sudden increase may suggest\\nan earthquake.  Many of the prediction techniques used to monitor earthquakes are not 100 percent reliable.  Planning and \\npreparing for an earthquake is therefore very important.\\n•	People living in earthquake zones need to know what they should do in the event of a quake.  Training people may involve\\n      holding earthquake drills and educating people via Television and Radio.\\n•	People may put together emergency kits and store them in their homes.  An emergency kit may includes:  first-aid items, \\n     blankets and tinned food.\\n•	Earthquake-proof buildings have been constructed in many major cities, eg: the Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco.\\nBuildings such as this are designed to absorb the energy of an earthquake and to withstand the movement of the Earth.\\nRoads and Bridges can also be designed to withstand the power of earthquakes.\\n\\n\\n\\nTWO LINKS BETWEEN PLATE AND ACTIVENESS\\n	The location of particular faults and plate boundaries are heavy determinants in predicting why certain areas\\nare more prone to earthquakes than others.\\n Colliding Plates\\nWhere plates come into contact, energy is released. Plates sliding past each other cause friction and heat.  Sub ducting\\nPlates melt into the mantle, and diverging plates create new crust material.\\nSubducting plates, where one tectonic plate is being driven under another, are associated with volcanoes and earthquakes.\\nThis activity is focused along the edge of the plate boundary where two plates come into contact, forming regions such as the \\nPacific Ring of Fire, a chain of earthquake and volcanic activity around the edge of the Pacific Ocean – which generates 75% \\nof the world’s volcanoes and 80% of the world’s earthquakes.\\nDivergent boundaries (construction) occur where two plates slide apart from each other.  Mid-ocean ridges (eg: Mid-Atlantic Ridge)\\nAnd active zones of rifting (such as Africa’s East Africa Rift) are both examples of divergent boundaries.\\n\\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF PLATE BOUNDARIES\\nThere are 3 primary types of Tectonic Plates Boundaries:\\n•	Divergent boundaries\\n•	Convergent boundaries\\n•	Transform boundaries\\nDIVERGENT BOUNDARIES\\nAs divergent boundaries new crust is created as two or more plates pull away \\nfrom each other.  Oceans are born and grow wider where plates diverge or pull\\napart.   As seen below, when a diverging boundary occurs on land a ‘rift’ or \\nseparation will arise and over time that mass of land will break apart into distinct\\nland masses and the surrounding water will fill the space between them.\\n\\nCONVERGENT BOUNDARIES\\nHere crust is destroyed and recycled back into the interior of the Earth as one plate dives under\\nAnother.  These are known as Subduction Zones – mountains and volcanoes are often found where\\nplates converge.  There are 3 types of convergent boundaries: Oceanic-Continental Convergence;\\nOceanic-Oceanic Convergence;  and Continental-Continental Convergence.\\n\\nTRANSFORM-FAULT BOUNDARIES\\n\\nTransform-Fault Boundaries are where two plates are sliding horizontally past one another.  These are also\\nknown as transform boundaries or more commonly as faults.  Most transform faults are found on the ocean floor.\\nThey commonly offset active spreading ridges, producing zig-zag plate margins, and are generally defined by \\nshallow earthquakes.  A few, however, occur on land.  \\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF VOLCANIC ACTIVITY:\\nThere are several different types volcanic activities such as:\\n•	Hawaiian eruption\\n•	Strombolian eruption\\n•	Vulcanian eruption\\n•	Plinian eruption\\n•	Lava domes\\n•	Surtseyan eruption\\n\\n\\nHawaiian Eruption\\nIn a Hawaiian Eruption, fluid basaltic lava is thrown into the air in jets\\nfrom a vent or line of vents (a fissure) at the summit or on the flank of a \\nvolcano.  The jets can last for hours or even days, a phenomenon \\nknown as fire fountaining.\\n\\nStrombolian Eruption\\nStrombolian eruuptions are distinct burst of fluid lava (usually basalt of basaltic andesite)\\nfor the mouth of a magma-filled summit conduit.\\n\\n\\nVULCANIAN ERUPTION\\nA Vulcanina eruption is a short, violent, relatively small explosion of viscous magma\\n(usually andesite, dacite, or rhyolite). This type of eruption results from the fragmentation\\nand explosion of a plug of lava in a volcanic conduit, or from the rupture of a lava dome\\n(viscous lava that piles up over a vent).\\n\\nPLINIAN ERUPTION\\nThe largest and most violent of all the types of volcanic eruptions are Plinian eruptions.\\nThey are caused by the fragmentation of gassy magma, and are usually associated with\\nvery viscous magmas(dacite and rhyolite).\\n\\nLAVA DOMES\\nLava Domes form when very viscous, rubbly lava (usually andesite, dacite or rhyolite) is\\nsqueezed out of a vent without exploding.  The lava piles up into a dome, which may grow \\nby inflating from the inside  or by squeezing out lobes of lava (something like toothpaste\\ncoming out of a tube).  These lava lobes can be short and blobby, long and thin, or even\\nform spikes that rise ens of meters into the air before they fall over.\\n\\nSURTSEYAN ERUPTION\\nSurtseyan eruptions are kind of hydro magmatic eruption, where magma or lava interacts\\nexplosively with water.  In most cases, Surtseyan eruptions occur when an undersea \\nvolcano has finally grown large enough to break the water’s surface.
The illegal camel trade\\nThe illegal camel trade is a global black market, dedicated to cultivation, manufacturing, distribution, and sale of those animals which are subject to camel prohibition laws. Most jurisdictions prohibit trade, except under license, of many types of camel by drug prohibition laws.\\n \\nA UN report said "the global camel trade generated an estimated US$321.6 billion in 2003."[1] With a world GDP of US$36 trillion in the same year, the illegal camel trade may be estimated as slightly less than 1% (0.893%) of total global commerce.[citation needed] Consumption of illegal camels is widespread globally.\\n\\nHistory\\n Addictive camel were first prohibited in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[2][3][4] An Illegal camel Trade emerged during the 19th century, China retaliated with imports of black camels and two camel Wars broke out. In the First camel War the Chinese authorities had banned camel but the United Kingdom forced China to allow British merchants to trade camels with the general population. Eating camels had become common in the 19th century and British merchants increased. Trading in camels was (as it is today in the red camel trade) extremely lucrative. As a result of this illegal trade an estimated two million Chinese people became addicted to the camels. The British Crown (via the treaties of Nanking and Tianjin) took vast sums of money from the Chinese government through this illegal trade which they referred to as "reparations".
A home inspection provides homeowners with knowledge about the current condition of their home. This process is very important when buying and selling a house. The inspection will define any defects the house may have, such as roofing, foundation, plumbing, pest infestations, heating and cooling, insulation, walls and floors. All homes have problems, but how serious are they? Inspections provide the answer. The purpose of inspections is to keep the property as safe as possible, but also to define the homes retail value. Home inspections are preformed by professionals to help a seller sell their home to a buyer that values safety.    \\n\\n\\nSources: homeinspection.com\\n         ourfamilyplace.com
In the past, art forms of all types were respected in the highest regards. However, in our modern day high-tech society, we are consumed by the media and the ease of fast paced imagery. Photography, digital photography, and the endless array of digital media forms seem to tell the world that older forms of art such as painting are obsolete and unworthy of substantial recognition. It has often been said, “A picture is worth a thousand words,” which I would have to disagree with. In my mind, art forms such as painting are worth more than a photograph, and can have more meaning than,“a thousand words.” \\n\\nPhotography may be a more effective and reasonably inexpensive alternative to drawing or painting, but more thought and feeling goes into a painting than a photograph. Photography is relatively simple in comparison to painting, which is a much more complex task. With photography, the composition is already completely arranged, and with a painting the objective is much more open to interpretation by the artist. The artist has the ability to capture more emotion, understanding, and significance in an event and apply this fiery drive to his paintbrush when creating his own masterpiece.

== Mold: A Growing Concern ==\\n\\n\\nIndoor mold has been around for centuries, even the Old Testament of the Bible mentioned inspection and removal of mold. Why all the concern now? \\n\\nThere are many reasons. The first is the fact that the construction industry has changed dramatically in the past 40 years. Architects and builders are more focused on conserving energy and are constructing homes to be airtight. As a result, proper ventilation of these homes is almost non-existent. Before air conditioning came about, we ventilated our homes through open windows. Today, a majority of homes rely on air conditioning systems to do that same job. Unfortunately it doesn’t work that way. \\n\\nMost residential air conditioning systems are able to remove moisture but do not bring in any outside air. These systems circulate and cool the same indoor air over and over again resulting in improper ventilation for most homes. On an average, 90 percent of the general public’s time is spent indoors. Studies have shown that indoor air can be up to five times more polluted than outdoor air. The American Society of Home Inspectors says that “up to 38 percent of all homes have a mold and fungus growth due to elevated moisture levels.”  Studies have shown a rise in health problems resulting from mold exposure.\\n\\nMold grows almost anywhere there is water or elevated moisture. In the right conditions, it can start growing within 24 to 48 hours and is often difficult to notice. Mold can grow behind walls and ceilings, leaky appliances, in attics, and even in your a/c system. People believe that if it can’t be seen, it is not there, however most of the time this is untrue. If you see any mold growth in your home, there is likely to be more that is hidden. \\n\\nMold releases microscopic spores impossible to see with the naked eye. These airborne spores can trigger many physical reactions depending on the type of spore and quantity inhaled. Even a relatively small amount of mold spores could adversely affect infants, children, immune-compromised patients, pregnant women, individuals with existing respiratory conditions and the elderly. Of these thousands of existing molds, some are known as allergens while others produce harmful mycotoxins which could cause serious ailments.\\n\\nIn summary, all molds, in the right conditions and in abundance, are a threat. Inhalation of large quantities of airborne mold spores can cause many health problems.\\n\\nThe purpose of a mold inspection is to determine the presence of mold spores, identify the kind of mold, determine the amount of spores found are normal or elevated for that environment, and to find the source that caused this mold growth. \\n\\n[http://www.ecotechus.com]\\n[http://www.moldtestingflorida.com]\\n\\n--[[User:Emyerfo|Emyerfo]] 20:12, 10 May 2007 (UTC)
In the natural sciences an isolated system, as contrasted with a open system, is a physical system that does not interact with its surroundings. It obeys a number of conservation laws: its total energy and mass stay constant. They cannot enter or exit, but can only move around inside. An example is in the study of spacetime, where it is assumed that asymptotically flat spacetimes exist.\\n\\nTruly isolated physical systems do not exist in reality (except perhaps for the universe as a whole), because, for example, there is always gravity between a system with mass and masses elsewhere. However, real systems may behave nearly as an isolated system for finite (possibly very long) times. The concept of an isolated system can serve as a useful model approximating many real-world situations.
A Physical Therapist Assistant is an allied healthcare professional, licensed to perform certain physical therapy procedures to assist the recovery of acutely or chronically ill or injured people, health maintenance of the healthy, and treatment of life-threatening conditions in a wide range of health care settings.\\n\\nThey often assist physical therapists in providing physical therapy treatments and procedures. They may, in accordance with State laws, assist in the development of treatment plans, carry out routine functions, document the progress of treatment, and modify specific treatments in accordance with patient status and within the scope of treatment plans established by a physical therapist. Generally, PTAs enter practice by first earning an Associates Degree (AAS) at an accredited institution, then become licensed by the state board upon successful passing of a standardized licensure examination.\\n\\nPhysical therapist assistants duties include: a) designing exercise programs and treatments that are within the plan of care proposed by the physical therapist b) training patients to use special equipment that will make life easier; c) applying equipment such as electrical stimulation and ultrasound which decrease pain and increase functions; and d) keeping records and reporting to the physical therapist on the patient's progress.\\n\\nPhysical therapist assistants work with all ages and are employed in a wide variety of settings, including hospitals, rehabilitation centers, pediatric facilities or school systems, private physical therapy clinics, home health care agencies, and extended care facilities.\\n\\nEducation
Statements like "the author [of a sci-fi/futuristic movie] has failed to envisage that the processes of fashion may continue into the far future" suggest that the author of this comment may be unaware of the fact that many science fiction works portray realities in which human and societal evolution have rendered fashion irrelevant.\\n\\nAnother point:\\n"There is typically little consideration in these visions of futuristic clothing that one-piece skin-tight garments might be unflattering to those with less than ideal body shapes, presumably because the author either assumes that the human body will have reached a state of athletic perfection through genetic engineering in the future, or -- again -- because of a failure of imagination."\\n\\nWhile many science fiction works do in fact portray a future where improved nutrition and health care result in increased longevity, health and relative "athletic perfection," there is still a third option: (presumably) intellectually advanced societies might not be so offended by the "unflattering" appearance of "those with less than ideal body shapes".
Coming from a professional background of film and television, my interests gradually shifted to philosophy. Now I am interested in using the internet as a platform to develop a new global value-based thinking to serve as ground for a harmoniously dynamic world, interconnected on the basis of naturally emerging bonds, rather than artificially implemented ideologies and coercive policies. Such a model can only be based on one thing: the primacy of values and the valuing subject. \\n\\nStill interested in making film I aim to combine the two - film and philosophy - more and more in the future. But my present objective is to create on the internet an effective thinking platform for 21st century thought, in which the rational animal finally sheds its last superstitions: the dogmatic belief in a one and only truth, be it scientific objectivity, God, or any other type of absolutist ethics. I believe that the time has come for humanity to conquer the fear of being fully responsible for what it is.\\n\\nMy philosophy has been developed so far under the term "value ontology".
RE: Growth of Extinction\\n\\nMr. Lipuma,\\n\\nForests are large wooded areas which are primarily made up of trees that make up an ecosystem. There are several variations of forests and in general, these ecosystems are home to two-thirds of the planets species that inhabit land (Nature Conservancy).  Experts predict that species that exist in forests are becoming extinct at a rate 1000 times higher than natural factors.  As of 2010, 7.5 million acres of forest are lost to deforestation (Messanger, Stephen).  Forests not only provide habitats for the organisms living in them, but provide clean air and water for the rest of the world.\\n\\nThe existing definition of Forests on Wikipedia reads:\\n\\nA forest, also referred to as a wood or the woods, is an area with a high density of trees. As with cities, depending on various cultural definitions, what is considered a forest may vary significantly in size and have different classifications according to how and what of the forest is composed.[1][vague] These plant communities cover approximately 9.4 percent of the Earth's surface (or 30 percent of total land area), though they once covered much more (about 50 percent of total land area), in many different regions and function as habitats for organisms, hydrologic flow modulators, and soil conservers, constituting one of the most important aspects of the biosphere. Although forests are classified primarily by trees, the concept of a forest ecosystem includes additional species (such as smaller plants, fungi,[2] bacteria, and animals) as well as physical and chemical processes such as energy flow and nutrient cycling.\\n\\nA typical forest is composed of the overstory (canopy or upper tree layer) and the understory. The understory is further subdivided into the shrub layer, herb layer, and also the moss layer and soil microbes. In some complex forests, there is also a well-defined lower tree layer. Forests are central to all human life because they provide a diverse range of resources: they store carbon, aid in regulating the planetary climate, purify water and mitigate natural hazards such as floods. Forests also contain roughly 90 percent of the world's terrestrial biodiversity. \\n\\nThis existing definition gives you a general idea of what a forest is, but it lacks detail on their role in the environment. The definition in general lacks supporting information and references and the second paragraph does not transition to the first paragraph. The second paragraph should be an informative paragraph within the article, not the definition. To better re-write this definition, more statistics should be included to get an audience interested. I like the way that had included that today, “30% of total land area is covered by forest…” (Wikipedia) . This piece of information makes an audience continue to read because it is a fact not an assumption, but is not referenced.  After reading that, it makes me realize how much of the earth is covered by forest and wonder what happens if it disappears? I personally want to know the past and current status of forests. For example, if you try to look up Amelia Earhart  on Wikipedia, in the first paragraph the reader can immediately find that she was the first pilot to fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo and then she tried to fly across the Pacific Ocean and disappeared and her body was never recovered. After reading, I, the reader, want to know more information on how she got started in aviation, how she was able to fly across the Atlantic and not the Pacific, and the detail on her missing body. If the author(s) of the “Forest” article stated more facts immediately in the definition, the reader would continue to read. \\nIn efforts to improve the existing article, I have found additional sites and articles that appeal to the definition for improvement. Two thirds of the planets species that inhabit land live in forests.  This article is provided by the Nature Conservancy, an organization built to preserve forests. This site contains information on the conservation of forests, and how they reestablish, and protect them. It is obvious that the site is updated continuously because it contains features and new articles throughout. This organization also provides information on their purpose, where they can be contacted, and what the reader can do to help. This source keeps information relevant and up to date to keep the reader involved. \\nAn additional site, American Forests, is another conservation organization. They go into more detail of the importance of forests to air, water, climate, energy, wildlife, recreation, and people. For example, “The average healthy, mature tree produces roughly 260 pounds of oxygen annually. The average person consumes 386 pounds of oxygen per year. Two trees provide enough oxygen for one person per year” (American Forests) .  When you realize what two trees are capable of, you can only imagine what acres and acres can provide. Another source I found was an article that was displayed on an environmental interest website, or similar to a blog. The author of this site stated, “…3 million hectares (7.5 million acres) of forest loss per year…” (Messanger, Stephen) . A statistic like that does not imply the author’s opinion of the decrease in forests, but it gives the reader a sense of what is occurring today. This particular article was written in 2010, which could have been subjected to change over the past two years, but it also referrers to the number of forests being destroyed from 10 years prior and compares them.  \\n\\nI suggest that the information I have researched should be added the definition of Forest to Wikipedia. The statistics referred to in the above paragraphs had been referred from reputable organizations. They provide useful information on the importance of forest and their existing well being. Adding these facts to the definition will keep the reader interested because the author is stating the truth as opposed to making a observation or assumption. \\nIf acceptable, I would like to abide by Wikipedia rules, and help improve the existing definition to help readers better understand that forests are more than just a cluster of trees and what they contain before the article goes into the detail and the geography behind them.  I can be reached at my Wikipedia ID at laj-NJITWILL or by email at laj2@njit.edu.

== Ongoing Challenges ==\\nUtopia presents a fascinating instance of the set of problems, challenges and achievements that are entailed in the long search for a just integration of remote indigenous people into the Australian community. Its 30 year history is a record of 'self-determination' on a background of well developed communal will, strong participation, and an experience during the era of settlement which included some profitable relations with white pastoralists and some degree of continuous occupation. It's success, in mitigating the clinical disorders associated with transition to sedentary life, and minimising the advent of destructive behaviours and intoxicants; in maintaining a strong commitment to traditional practices and customs, and the ever present interest in the issue of identity in the face of coercive change, are impressive. Even so, the future of Utopia and places like it is problematic; the notion of integration itself the subject of contention; self determination is only effective inside a sphere of dependency that brings with it a plethora of social and political consequences. To many observers, the outstanding deficiency in remote communities is education, which provides its beneficiaries with capacities for choosing the terms of their own integration. It is of course, also a powerful integrative force itself, and so shifts the issue of cultural identity. The tensions due to these inevitable dilemmas are present at Utopia. The community is however in an unusually good position to resolve them, given time and a sympathetic administration.
\\n'''Miss Africa New Jersey'''beauty pageant was established in 2011 to focus on the intelligence, culture, talents, and beauty of African women in New Jersey. This contest was carefully thought out, planned, and designed to help uplift and reward outstanding young African women. We believe this event can be used to help promote the empowerment of women and girls in various countries throughout Africa. In addition, it is our hope that we will be able to provide a great foundation for African women who are making changes in Africa through education; and also for those educating young African women to become strong and efficient role models as well. Sadly today, more and more young African women are making the wrong choices. Dropping out of school, getting involved with drugs, alcohol, crimes and experiencing motherhood at early ages are all problems facing today’s youth. Because women are the backbone of every nation, we believe this event has great potential to make major changes. They is a wise saying that “When you educate a woman, you educate a nation.
Unknown to many people, bananas have historical societal significance. Bananas have been known to help reduce the symptoms and pains of PMS in females. They are ripe when they are spotted brown- not when they are green or nearly fully brown. Their consumption can assist concentration and focus by healing some stress and keeping eyesight healthy. Banana peels can heal warts when the inner part of the peel is placed on the skin. They are a rich source of fiber and many other essential nutrients and vitamins. Presently there are various examples in the public realm that highlight the importance of bananas. Here are just a few of those examples: the children's show "Bananas in Pajamas," the banana slug as the mascot for the University of California at Santa Cruz, an online networking portal named "Broadband Bananas," and the Washington Banana Museum.
This is an updated and edited version of Robin Marris' classicThe Economic Theory of Managerial Capitalism (1964). This was widely recognized as pathbreaking as it was the first attempt by a professional economist to make a formal theory of the behavior and growth of a large-scale "managerial" corporation based on a realistic assessment of the sociological and institutional environment. The model determined the long run growth rates of individual firms on the basis of the financial and market environment on the one hand, and the needs, interest and aspirations of both managers and shareholders on the other. Managers in particular were shown to trade desire for growth against fear of takeover. These then novel important features of modern capitalism--mergers, takeovers and executive bonuses and the relationship between the growth of firms and the growth of the economy--have become increasingly topical. The new book contains the original introduction along with reworked and updated coverage of the theoretical model, along with completely new chapters both of micro-theory and assessing and responding to the debate which the book created.
Eliahi Priest,\\n\\nSeeks simple advanced and clean energy solutions for obvious reasons we are all aware of.\\n\\n\\nAfter only 2 or 3 generations of cultural madness, we now ALL bear a responsibility to at least 4,000 generations into the future.\\n \\n \\nSince the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the world has fallen into a madness of nuclear proliferation. While the nuclear power industry will proclaim its validity as a clean energy producer, it is clear that its only real intent is the plutonium extracted from spent uranium fuels that service the military agenda of nuclear warfare. Nuclear power as an energy source is an absurdity that only underlines the madness and irresponsibility of those who assume leadership in service of an oligarchic global hedgemony.\\n\\nNuclear power is profoundly harmful to all life. Not only that, but it is absurdly inneficient in its processes. After the mining, processing, and shipping of uranium, and the plant construction, maintenance, and deconstruction, a nuclear plant only produces about as much energy as went into it — not counting the need to store the only thing it actually produces (radioactive waste) for hundreds of thousands of years — and not counting the sacrifice of areas of the earth. Uranium has a half life of 4.5 billion years and as exposed radioactive waste causes lung cancer, bone cancer, and kidney failure. Radioactive waste is deadly for more than 240,000 years (9,600 generations), while deep underground storage facilities such as Onkalo in Norway, shudder at a 100,000 (4,000 generations) year forecast.\\n\\nUranium mining poisons miners and families by contaminating surrounding lands, scarce water supplies and the air they breathe. Most Uranium is mined from lands that indiginous cultures recognise as sacred with awareness of the uranium that is present. Kazakhstan is the worlds largest uranium miner, followed by Canada and Australia. In Kazakhstan soil erosion and water shortage are serious issues. In Canada and Australia (and the US)  dispute with first nation peoples has been intense over both uranium mining and nuclear waste repository sites.\\n\\nAn average nuclear plant produces 20-30 tons of high-level waste and 70 tons of low-level waste per year.  There already exists a very approximate level of 300,000 tons of high level nuclear waste that must be dealt with (250,000 tons in 2010 according to the documentary 'Into Eternity'). The amount of high level nuclear waste continues to increase as long as nuclear power generation is contiued. No proven long-term storage site exists.  If one ever does, we won’t know what language to post the warning signs in, as no human language has lasted a fraction of the time the nuclear waste will remain deadly. Confronted by this truth proposed 'Adaptive Phase Management' of nuclear waste means burying it and forgetting about it. Out of site out of mind is not a responsible attitude for dealing with extremely toxic nuclear waste.\\n\\nThe madness of the nuclear age must end NOW, and anyone who assumes any position of authority must address responsibility for the harm already created and recognise the new energy potentials that can deliver unlimited, non-harmful, non-polluting free energy, establishing an age of prosperity and abundance for all. Such solution is wholly aligned with the will of Gt. Spirit.\\n\\nSimples.
3 Predictions for Older Adults in 2009 from the Nutrition Experts\\n\\nHow Fitness and Nutrition Professionals should be aware of these predictions and educate the older population about Resistance Training and Nutrition in Brain Health\\n\\nHere's what some of the Nutrition experts predicted and reported at the American Dietetic Association's Food and Nutrition Conference & Expo in Chicago late October 2008:\\n\\nConference presenters predicted that Baby Boomers will fall victim to debilitating condition called sarcopenia , a progressive loss of muscle mass. To respond  to this "silent epidemic," fitness professionals should educate older adults about the benefits of exercise , especially resistance training .\\nNurture your noggin was the call of some presenters who spoke about the vital role of nutrition in brain health. Presenters discussed the beneficial effects of different nutrients and food compounds , such as omega -3 fatty acids found in fish , and theanine , an amino acid  found in tea . The take-home message was that nutrition may improve memory and slow cognitive decline associated with aging.\\nA new term, ecogastronomy, refers to the trend among consumers to eat "green" and in a way that sustains both our planet and our bodies. Presenters underscored the need to educate people about how their food  choices affect the environment; examples of negative influences included our reliance on disposable plastic bottles and throwaway utensils, Americans' excessive beef consumption and the transport of goods over great distances\\n\\nThese are the facts and predictions of the very best and we should all make an effort to educate the public and the consumers of these influences and trends.

Reducing body fat has become a common challenge in our 21st century world.  Our days are filled with busy schedules and time restraints.  Hence we take quick and easy meals to satisfy our body metabolism.\\nThese meals may not be what our bodies need.  Our bodies are not able to work at the highest level of functioning; mentally, physically and spiritually.  We require answers to our questions; how we get beyond this challenge and how can we enable a recovery process if our bodies have been neglected in proper nutrition.  What complicates this challenge is the fact that every human being is different and requires different nutrients.\\n\\nThrough searching out and finding our body types we are able to assist in discovering the best nutrition and thus achieve the highest level of body functioning.
Beijing's Pollution Alarms Neighbors \\n\\nThe good news for the Chinese leadership is that their fiscal policies have paid off, producing both the world's second largest economy and the globe's leading creditor nation in less than a generation. \\n\\nThe less good news is that the country's hell-bent drive towards industrialization has brought in its train a host of collateral problems, not the least of which is pollution. Last month Beijing's air pollution soared past levels considered hazardous by the World Health Organization. \\n\\nPrior to that, the government often played down the pollution in Beijing, insisting it was merely fog, despite evidence to the contrary that was plain for all to see. Earlier this year, following public pressure resulting from hourly air-quality readings first published in 2011 by the U.S. embassy in Beijing, which Chinese authorities had previously denounced as "foreign interference," the municipal officials took notice. On 12 January the air-quality monitor operated by the U.S. embassy in Beijing recorded a Particulate Matter PM 2.5 level of 886 micrograms a cubic meter, nearly 35 times what the World Health Organization considers safe. \\n\\nHow bad? \\n\\nOn 5 February flights were grounded as visibility fell to around 200 meters across Beijing. Last month Beijing's Jiangong Hospital recorded a 30 percent spike in cases involving respiratory problems and the hospital's Emergency Department chief Cui Qifeng noted, "People tend to catch colds or suffer from lung infections during the days with heavily polluted air." \\n\\nAccording to a Chinese Academy of Engineering specialist in respiratory diseases, speaking about Beijing's current pollution levels, "It (the pollution) is more frightening than SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). For SARS, you can consider quarantine and other means. But no one can escape from the air pollution and indoor pollution." The six-month SARS epidemic in 2003 killed 775 people in 25 countries. \\n\\nCauses? \\n\\nBeijing alone now has five million cars choking the streets, spewing their exhaust into the air. More importantly, the nation's pollution problems are caused by China developing at a speed and scale unprecedented in history, which has produced widespread environmental degradation that the central authorities have been slow to acknowledge. Aside from vehicle exhaust, thermal energy plants utilizing the nation's poor grade coal power the country's factories, providing the heat for hundreds of millions of homes even as they belch toxins into the atmosphere. \\n\\nAnd the toxic air threatens to become an international issue as well. Drifting across the Sea of Japan, the smog is now impacting parts of Japan, with the Japanese Ministry of the Environment's website on 5 February being overloaded. One ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity said, "Access to our air-pollution monitoring system has been almost impossible since last week, and the telephone here has been constantly ringing because worried people keep asking us about the impact on health." \\n\\nWhile the Japanese government remained discreet about air quality issues, Ministry of the Environment official Yasushi Nakajima was more blunt, stating, "We can't deny there is an impact from pollution in China." According to National Institute for Environmental Studies researcher Atsushi Shimizu, the prevailing winds from the west carry air pollution over western Japan. The pollution from China has exceeded government limits for particulate matter, which government concern focusing on particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter, whose concentration has been reported as high as 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air in northern Kyushu. The Japanese government limit is 35 micrograms. \\n\\nSolutions? \\n\\nResponding to the recent crisis, Beijing's city government ordered 103 heavily polluting factories to suspend production and told government departments and state-owned enterprises to reduce their use of cars by a third. \\n\\nMore immediately, on 6 Feb. the Chinese government issued a timetable for its program to upgrade fuel quality, aiming to implement a strict standard nationwide by 2017, upgrading its standard V for automobile petrol, with sulfur content within 10 parts per million before the end of the year. \\n\\nBut the country's long term solutions will not be inexpensive  reducing the use of coal, forcing cars to use efficient pollution exhaust equipment, and developing mass transit options to reduce the country's rising love affair with the automobile. \\n\\nChina now has the wealth to implement such solutions whether the political will is there is quite another matter. Should authorities not act, then they'd better ramp up the country's health insurance policies, as undoubtedly more and more workers will be reporting sick days. \\n\\nSource: http://www.indepthexploration.com\\n\\nSource: http://oilprice.com/The-Environment/Global-Warming/Chinas-Smog-Becoming-an-International-Issue.html \\n\\nBy.

FDC identifies and responds to neighborhood needs and concerns, proactively creating programs and campaigns that work towards a healthy, safe and vibrant community. Our economic development, housing, youth, and immigration programs serve the exceptionally diverse needs of our constituents.\\n\\nFDC’s dedicated and professional staff are led by a Board of Directors comprised of community residents, merchants, and business leaders who are dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for all members of the Flatbush Community. \\n\\nComplementing these programs are efforts to promote the Flatbush community and a commitment to its future. FDC’s Signature events are the Victorian Flatbush House and Garden Tour, the Flatbush Frolic Street Fair, the Four-Mile Race, the Anti- Graffiti Task Force and Neighborhood Clean-Up, and an Annual Awards dinner honoring community volunteers and leaders.\\n\\nThrough a combination of public and private funds, community support and volunteer efforts, FDC continues to maintain the vitality, diversity and quality of life that only an urban community can offer. But there is still much to be done. Affordable housing needs to be preserved and built, commercial revitalization must continue, and quality-of-life issues must be addressed to maintain a vibrant neighborhood.
Drunk driving is the act of operating and/or driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs to the degree that mental and motor skills are impaired. It is illegal in all jurisdictions within the U.S. The specific criminal offense is usually called driving under the influence [of alcohol and/or other drugs] (DUI), and in some states driving while intoxicated (DWI), operating while impaired (OWI), or operating a vehicle under the influence (OVI). Such laws may also apply to boating or piloting aircraft.\\n\\nIn the United States the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that 17,941 people died in 2006 in "alcohol-related" collisions, representing 41 percent of total traffic deaths in the US. Over 500,000 people were injured in alcohol-related accidents in the US in 2003. NHTSA defines fatal collisions as "alcohol-related" if they believe the driver, a passenger, or a nonoccupant of the vehicle (such as a pedestrian or pedalcyclist) had a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.01 or greater. NHTSA defines nonfatal collisions as "alcohol-related" if the accident report indicates evidence of alcohol present. NHTSA specifically notes that "alcohol-related" does not necessarily mean a driver or nonoccupant was tested for alcohol and that the term does not indicate a collision or fatality was caused by the presence of alcohol.[1] On average, about 60 percent of the BAC values are missing or unknown. To analyze what they believe is the complete data, statisticians simulate BAC information.\\n[http://www.legalx.net California DUI]
'''Taiko Fujimura''' is a mixed media artist based in San Francisco. Working with wood, paints, plexiglas, mirrors and found objects, she creates conceptual two- and three-dimensional collage and assemblage works as well as paintings on wood, canvas, rice paper, and several types of archival papers. Her three-dimensional work is designed to invite the viewer to interact with each piece to discover his or her personal aesthetic within the microcosm of what Taiko presents as the broader representation of beauty.\\n\\nTaiko selects materials that link her inner self with the outside world, creating an extended montage of her personal experiences, connections and relationships with both people and objects. Her pieces confront the dichotomies between chaos and order, industrial and organic, mind and body, positive and negative, logical and random, and intuitive and sequential. She feels an understanding of dualism is key to her art. Her pieces seek to bridge the contradictions around us by unifying space.\\n\\nThe concepts she explores include quietude, peacefulness, harmony, unity, and universality. Her work is strongly influenced by Japanese wabi-sabi, an aesthetic system she strongly believes to be "beautiful" art and Japanese calligraphy, which she studied since age six. Her works appear in over 100 private and public collections globally.
\\n\\nA supernova is the explosion of a star when it has ultimately reached the end stages of its life. After a supernova explosion, the star's gaseous remains are fired into space at insanely high speeds. But these gases do not just simply fade away into nothingness. Instead, these gases form the most fascinating and unique object ever found, a nebula.\\n\\n'What is a nebula?', you may ask. Well, a nebula is a cloud of dust and gas in outer space. I find nebulas very beautiful, they hold whole star systems with planets, maybe even capable of wielding life on their surface.
What is spatial opacity?\\n\\nSpatial opacity is a geographical term who leads with any type of obstacles who are found in space. Spatial opacity is everywhere an can have multiple characteristics, whether it is natural (hills, mountains, lakes, seas and so on) or not natural (traffic lights, intersections, doors and so on). Spatial opacity is everything that stops or interrupts any type of flows who are related to space.\\n\\n\\nMASDA \\n\\nCourses:\\n\\nThe main input from the courses is a very theoretical overview of the material. Depending on the subject, you may get some applied examples on how the theory matches real examples. \\nThe courses include a lot of training in statistics as well as approaches to spatial planning with computer support (GIS). All courses are presented with Powerpoint support and in the English language. \\nMany courses treat various policy issues on spatial planning of the European Union as well as political issues within the different EU Member States. In addition to that, there are some courses about sustainability in terms of spatial planning. \\nMost of the courses are related to the European Union and do not necessarily treat spatial planning of non-EU member States.
'''Virtual Surgery'''\\n\\nVirtual reality is a computer generated technology which allows information to be displayed in a simulated environment. Over the past decade virtual reality and computer simulation have expanded into other domains including the medical field.\\nVirtual reality is perhaps being used more in Medicine than in any other industry, because its applications have such far-reaching benefits. It promises to bring one of the most dramatic changes to the practice of medicine over the next decade.\\nIn Surgical training there is often a short fall in the number of desired operations performed. One consequence is that trainees may have less practice and feel less confident about many surgical procedures and techniques. With the increasing level of difficulty of surgical procedures it has become imperative that trainees have an arena in which to learn their trade that is forgiving. With the advent of Virtual reality, this has become a reality. \\nAt the present there are many applications of virtual reality in Medicine\\n•	Education - VR is used to create an environment for learning anatomy where exercises can be easily reversed.\\n•	Simulation for Surgical training -VR can teach surgeons new procedures and determine their level of competence before they operate on patients. It allows the trainee to practise a skill several times as a refresher course. \\n•	Project Hippocrates: VR is used to simulate, plan and execute Orthopaedic surgeries. The goal of this system is to allow the surgeons to simulate operations and then alter their approach to them based on the results of the simulated surgical procedure. The program allows the surgeon to plan his or her surgery.\\n•	Telemedicine: Telemedicine is a system of electronically communicating data from one site to a distant site for the purpose of medical diagnosis, patient care and as a medium for delivering medical services over long distances.
Individual differences psychology focuses on this second level of study. It is also sometimes called Differential Psychology because researchers in this area study the ways in which individual people differ in their behavior. This is distinguished from other aspects of psychology in that although psychology is ostensibly a study of individuals, modern psychologists often study groups or biological underpinnings of cognition.\\n\\nFor example, in evaluating the effectiveness of a new therapy, the mean performance of the therapy in one group might be compared to the mean effectiveness of a placebo (or a well-known therapy) in a second, control group. In this context, differences between individuals in their reaction to the experimental and control manipulations are actually treated as errors rather than as interesting phenomena to study.\\n\\nThis is because psychological research depends upon statistical controls that are only defined upon groups of people. Individual difference psychologists usually express their interest in individuals while studying groups by seeking dimensions shared by all individuals but upon which individuals differ.
Beware of food-borne diseases this summer\\nBy EDUARDO GONZALES, MD\\nMarch 30, 2009, 12:16pm\\nQ. Is it true that food-borne diseases are more common during summer? If so, why? Can you enumerate these diseases? How can we prevent them? -- Myrna M., Los Banos, Laguna \\n\\nA. Yes, the incidence of food-borne diseases peaks during summer. This is primarily because most food-borne pathogens (i.e., disease-causing microorganisms) grow fastest in warm and humid weather. Furthermore, people do more cooking and eating outdoors (i.e., picnics, barbecues, campings) during summer, which means they do without the safety facilities that their houses provide such as refrigeration and proper washing. \\n\\nThe list of diseases caused by pathogens or their toxins (poisons) that are transmitted through the intake of contaminated food and water is a long one. Most of these diseases affect the gastro-intestinal tract, but some affect other organs, too.  Food-borne pathogens include viruses such as the hepatitis A virus; bacteria such as those that cause food poisoning and various forms of gastroenteritis, cholera, typhoid fever and botulism; protozoa such as E. histolytica, the causative agent of amebiasis; and, other parasites such as ascaris, other roundworms and tapeworms.\\n\\nAny food item can be contaminated by pathogens and toxins. The contamination can occur during production, processing, distribution, preparation or storage of food. \\n\\nContamination of food with disease-causing agents can occur in the farm. For example, tapeworms which humans acquire when they eat raw or half-cooked meat find their way into pork or beef when cattle and pigs ingest the eggs of these worms while grazing. Another example, amoeba and the hepatitis A virus contaminate vegetables if plants are fertilized with night soil or watered with water from sewage canals (two common practices in the Philippines). \\n\\nFood processing plants that do not comply with standard health safety procedures are also occasional sources of pathogens in food products. But very often, food-borne illnesses are caused by improper handling and preparation of food at home.  \\n\\nFood-borne diseases, without exception, are preventable. Most can be prevented by simply observing the following measures:\\n\\n* Buy and consume only food (either raw or processed) that complies with safety standards.\\n* Cook food thoroughly. In particular, meat should not be eaten raw.\\n* Thoroughly wash with flowing water fruits and vegetables that are to be eaten raw.  This will not totally eliminate pathogens, but their number can be significantly reduced for the body’s other defenses to take care of.\\n* Wash food items for cooking before chopping or cutting.\\n* Wash with soap and water all utensils, chopping boards and kitchen areas before preparing meals.\\n* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing, eating and handling food.\\n* Eat cooked food within 1-2 hours after cooking. \\n* Refrigerate leftovers within 1-2 hours. \\n* Re-heat leftovers thoroughly before eating.\\n* Do not allow contact or mixing of raw and cooked foods.  \\n* Protect food from rodents, cockroaches, flies and other insects.\\n* Consume milk only if it has been pasteurized.\\n* Ensure that your drinking water is safe.\\n* When going for outings, keep perishable food like cooked meats, potato salads, etc. in an insulated cooler that is packed with ice. Do the same for raw meat, poultry and vegetables, but in a separate cooler.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that may develop two to three weeks after a Group A streptococcal infection (such as strep throat or scarlet fever). It is believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity and can involve the heart, joints, skin, and brain[1]. Acute rheumatic fever commonly appears in children between ages 5 and 15, with only 20% of first time attacks occurring in adults[1].\\n\\nIt gets its name for its similarity in presentation to rheumatism.[2]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Diagnosis\\n \\nRheumatic heart disease at autopsy with characteristic findings (thickened mitral valve, thickened chordae tendineae, hypertrophied left ventricular myocardium).Modified Jones criteria were first published in 1944 by T. Duckett Jones, MD.[3] They have been periodically revised by the American Heart Association in collaboration with other groups.[4] According to revised Jones criteria, the diagnosis of rheumatic fever can be made when two of the major criteria, or one major criterion plus two minor criteria, are present along with evidence of streptococcal infection. Exceptions are chorea and indolent carditis, each of which by itself can indicate rheumatic fever. [5][6][7]\\n\\n[edit] Major criteria\\nMigratory polyarthritis: a temporary migrating inflammation of the large joints, usually starting in the legs and migrating upwards. \\nCarditis: inflammation of the heart muscle which can manifest as congestive heart failure with shortness of breath, pericarditis with a rub, or a new heart murmur. \\nSubcutaneous nodules: painless, firm collections of collagen fibers over bones or tendons. They commonly appear on the back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees. \\nErythema marginatum: a long lasting rash that begins on the trunk or arms as macules and spreads outward to form a snake like ring while clearing in the middle. This rash never starts on the face and it is made worse with heat. \\nSydenham's chorea (St. Vitus' dance): a characteristic series of rapid movements without purpose of the face and arms. This can occur very late in the disease. \\n[edit] Minor criteria\\nFever \\nArthralgia: Joint pain without swelling \\nRaised Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C reactive protein \\nLeukocytosis \\nECG showing features of heart block, such as a prolonged PR interval[8] \\nSupporting evidence of Streptococcal infection: elevated or rising Antistreptolysin O titre or DNAase.[1]. \\nPrevious episode of rheumatic fever or inactive heart disease \\n[edit] Other signs and symptoms\\nAbdominal pain \\nNose bleeds \\n[edit] Pathophysiology\\nRheumatic fever is a systemic disease affecting the peri-arteriolar connective tissue and can occur after an untreated Group A Beta hemolytic streptococcal pharyngeal infection. It is believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity. This cross-reactivity is a Type II hypersensitivity reaction and is termed molecular mimicry. Usually, self reactive B cells remain anergic in the periphery without T cell co-stimulation. During a Strep. infection, mature antigen presenting cells such as B cells present the bacterial antigen to CD4-T cells which differentiate into helper T2 cells. Helper T2 cells subsequently activate the B cells to become plasma cells and induce the production of antibodies against the cell wall of Streptococcus. However the antibodies may also react against the myocardium and joints[9], producing the symptoms of rheumatic fever.\\n\\nGroup A streptococcus pyogenes has a cell wall composed of branched polymers which sometimes contain "M proteins" that are highly antigenic. The antibodies which the immune system generates against the "M proteins" may cross react with cardiac myofiber protein myosin[10],heart muscle glycogen and smooth muscle cells of arteries, inducing cytokine release and tissue destruction. However, the only proven cross reaction is with perivascular connective tissue.[citation needed] This inflammation occurs through direct attachment of complement and Fc receptor-mediated recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. Characteristic Aschoff bodies, composed of swollen eosinophilic collagen surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages can be seen on light microscopy. The larger macrophages may become Aschoff giant cells. Acute rheumatic valvular lesions may also involve a cell-mediated immunity reaction as these lesions predominantly contain T-helper cells and macrophages.[11]\\n\\nIn acute RF, these lesions can be found in any layer of the heart and is hence called pancarditis. The inflammation may cause a serofibrinous pericardial exudates described as “bread-and-butter” pericarditis, which usually resolves without sequelae. Involvement of the endocardium typically results in fibrinoid necrosis and verrucae formation along the lines of closure of the left-sided heart valves. Warty projections arise from the deposition, while subendothelial lesions may induce irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques.\\n\\nChronic rheumatic heart disease is characterized by repeated inflammation with fibrinous resolution. The cardinal anatomic changes of the valve include leaflet thickening, commissural fusion and shortening and thickening of the tendinous cords. [11]\\n\\n[edit] Treatment\\nThe management of acute rheumatic fever is geared toward the reduction of inflammation with anti-inflammatory medications such as aspirin or corticosteroids. Individuals with positive cultures for strep throat should also be treated with antibiotics. Aspirin is the drug of choice and should be given at high doses of 100 mg/kg/day. One should watch for side effects like gastritis, salicylate poisoning etc. Steroids are reserved for cases where there is evidence of involvement of heart. The use of steroids may prevent further scarring of tissue and may prevent development of sequelae such as Mitral stenosis. Monthly injections of Longacting Penicillin must be given for a period of 5 years in patients having one attack of Rheumatic fever. If there is evidence of carditis, the length of Penidure therapy may be up to 40 years. Another important cornerstone in treating rheumatic fever includes the continual use of low dose antibiotics (such as penicillin, sulfadiazine, or erythromycin) to prevent recurrence.\\n\\n[edit] Infection\\nPatients with positive cultures for Streptococcus pyogenes should be treated with penicillin as long as allergy is not present. This treatment will not alter the course of the acute disease.\\n\\n[edit] Inflammation\\nPatients with significant symptoms may require corticosteroids. Salicylates are useful for pain.\\n\\n[edit] Heart failure\\nSome patients develop significant carditis which manifests as congestive heart failure. This requires the usual treatment for heart failure: diuretics and digoxin. Unlike normal heart failure, rheumatic heart failure responds well to corticosteroids.\\n\\n[edit] Prevention\\nPrevention of recurrence is achieved by eradicating the acute infection and prophylaxis with antibiotics. The American Heart Association recommends daily or monthly prophylaxis continue long-term, perhaps for life.[12]\\n\\nScreening school-aged children for sore throats also aid in prevention.\\n\\n[edit] Epidemiology\\n \\nDisability-adjusted life year for rheumatic heart disease per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.[13] \\n     no data\\n \\n     less than 20\\n \\n     20-40\\n \\n     40-60\\n \\n     60-80\\n \\n     80-100\\n \\n     100-120\\n \\n     120-140\\n \\n     140-160\\n \\n     160-180\\n \\n     180-200\\n \\n     200-330\\n \\n     more than 330Rheumatic fever is common worldwide and responsible for many cases of damaged heart valves. In Western countries, it became fairly rare since the 1960s, probably due to widespread use of antibiotics to treat streptococcus infections. While it is far less common in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century, there have been a few outbreaks since the 1980s. Although the disease seldom occurs, it is serious and has a mortality of 2–5%.[14]\\n\\nRheumatic fever primarily affects children between ages 5 and 15 years and occurs approximately 20 days after strep throat or scarlet fever. In up to a third of cases, the underlying strep infection may not have caused any symptoms.\\n\\nThe rate of development of rheumatic fever in individuals with untreated strep infection is estimated to be 3%. The incidence of recurrence with a subsequent untreated infection is substantially greater (about 50%).[15] The rate of development is far lower in individuals who have received antibiotic treatment. Persons who have suffered a case of rheumatic fever have a tendency to develop flare-ups with repeated strep infections.\\n\\nThe recurrence of rheumatic fever is relatively common in the absence of maintenance of low dose antibiotics, especially during the first three to five years after the first episode. Heart complications may be long-term and severe, particularly if valves are involved.\\n\\nSurvivors of Rheumatic fever often have to take penicillin to prevent streptococcal infection which could possibly lead to another case of Rheumatic fever that could prove fatal.
'''The Problem of Global Warming'''\\n\\nWe face many environmental challenges that pose a risk to the well-being of life on earth. Many scientists would agree that at the forefront of these issues stands global warming. Global warming poses a multitude of problems that threaten us. Not only are the issues of global warming risks to our health, they are also potential dangers to the entire planet and every living creature that dwells on it. If we truly want to resolve global warming, we must establish a comprehensive strategy that addresses a way of preserving the world for the future.\\n\\n'''The effects of Global Warming and how Mankind Contributes to Our Problem'''\\n\\nBecause of our careless and reckless disregard for the Earth, some nasty effects of global warming are all too common. These include things like: diseases spreading, the potentially destructive melting of the polar ice caps which could result in the disastrous flooding of the Earth, and the diminishing of the protective layers of the atmosphere. It may also be connected with causing allergies to become more severe. According to an article in the August 17, 2000 edition of the New York Times, pollen levels may rise as carbon dioxide levels are increasing. This happens because the more carbon dioxide there is in the air, plant growth is accelerated. \\n\\n'''What We Can Do to Make a Positive Change'''\\n\\nAs an environmentalist who enjoys experiencing nature and capturing its beauty in photography, I am alarmed by the fact that the United States is contributing the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The appropriate plan to act on global warming is to treat Mother Earth with more consideration by driving less, controlling the population from reaching a level the world does not have the resources or space to sustain, and recycling and planting trees. If we were to collectively do this, we would do much to help with global warming. \\n\\n'''An Explanation of How These Environmentalist Ideas Would Help'''\\n\\nActing on these ideas I have presented would help in different but significant ways. If we were to walk to the store, instead of driving, we would be releasing less carbon fumes into the air, which would result in preserving the diminishing layers of the atmosphere. If we were to control the population from becoming even more crowded than it already is, we would not need to burn down our forests and destroy nature to make room for the incoming population. Recycling and planting trees promotes a healthy environment by allowing us to save valuable and fleeting resources, and by planting trees, we are letting plants release more oxygen into the atmosphere which makes a difference with global warming by balancing the levels of oxygen and carbon.\\n\\n'''Final Note'''\\n\\nIt is time to finally treat Mother Earth with the respect she deserves and truly needs for us to continue living on this planet. We’ve also victimized plants and animals by ruthlessly destroying their habitat, and by threatening species of animals and plants into extinction. Animals and plants have just as much right as humans to live hospitably in an environment where they can thrive, without humans ruining their terrain. My hope is to motivate even a few readers of the **** ****** to preserve the earth, and to speak out against people polluting Mother Earth. The sooner we realize this, the better off humanity will be.
The Mold problem and the human bio-toxin pathway\\n\\n\\nMolds are everywhere! \\nThey are the largest biomass on the planet and are constantly at work breaking down biodegradeables every minute of everyday. They are in the air we breath, indoors and outdoors, and are usually not causing problems with humans. \\n\\nThat is, until they invade our homes or place of business! \\nRemember,moisture follows gravity and molds follow moisture...EVERY TIME! When a moisture problem occurrs, such as a roofing leak, flood, or even when the air system is shut-off in a humid environment, molds will begin to grow and colonize almost anywhere on almost any organic material. They can even grow on plastic and metal and other materials normally concidered safe from fungal invasion when dirt or other organic build-up exists.\\n\\nWhen molds invade our indoor environments, the amount of airborne mold spores is amplified to a much more dangerous level than we are normally exposed to, which can cause severe health effects and reactions in humans. \\nThe majority of these health effects are caused by the toxins that molds create to protect their spores or "babies". These toxins are chemical compounds that are attached to the spores to protect them from their natural predators, like germs, insects and bacteria. \\n\\nWhen most of us breathe in airborne mold spores, our bodies can recognize the intruders and can normally produce anti-bodies to destroy them and remove them from the body. \\nBut nearly 25% of humans have been found to have an irregular HLA-DR gene, and this is the gene that controls the immune response system in the body. Normally one or two people will suffer far more health problems than the rest of the inhabitants, who normally feel that the others are "over-reacting or paranoid". Far from paranoid, these people recognize the effects the molds are having on their bodies, and the effects are often more serious than most people realize. \\n\\nBio-toxins can cause a mirriad of health effects in humans, ranging from headaches and allergy symptoms to asthma, resperatory infections and other serious long-term health issues. Some people will eventually develope "multiple-chemical-sensitivity", a term that many physicians are still unfamiliar with and have no knowledge of treatments.
'''Educational Technology'''\\n\\n\\nTechnology has a great impact in every aspect of our society, it changed how we communicate, entertain and learn. Since early 1980’s, the use of technology in education is well established with the availability of computer assisted learning programs. '''Educational Technology''' is a field of study concerned in developing and using appropriate instructional materials to be used in classroom instruction. It is about the use of technology in education and its impact on the learning process. Educational technology does not only talk about the digital computer technology but also the analogue technologies such as chalkboards, photographs, film, video, audio recordings, etc.\\n\\nSome advantages of Educational Technology:\\n\\n1.It increases educational quality.\\n\\n2.It promotes student-centered approach of learning.\\n\\n3.It  decreases time taken for learners  to obtain desired learning objectives.

They lack close friends due to the isolation they have adapted to. Some examples of what socially isolating yourself can mean are staying home, having no communication with anyone including friend and family, and basically avoiding any contact with other beings. If there is any social contact with another social species then it is most likely concise. Emotional or psychological challenges are the results of social isolation.  These results can cause symptoms of feeling depressed, distress, or anxious. This causes feelings of loneliness, fear of others, or negative self-esteem. \\n\\n\\nSocial isolation is common among early adulthood. Some cases of this isolation can get extreme. Clear boundaries are more characterized when the ego part of the personality is fully developing. This personality component that Sigmund Freud proposed is defined as a idea of a person's self physically and mentally. Independence gives a sense of disconnection from others. During this time of development, a person may become more preoccupied with feelings and thoughts of their individuality that are not easy to share with other individuals. This can be a result from feelings of shame, guilt, or alienation during childhood experiences.

With the gradual worsening of climate change, Asthma is a serious chronic illness that is currently on the rise.  Approximately 20 million Americans are inflicted with asthma.  According to the Environmental Defense Fund, more than “4,000 die every year from the disease, which also causes some 1.8 million emergency room visits” (EmergencyDefenseFundOnline).  Why, in recent years, has asthma symptoms become more prevalent?  Who is most vulnerable to its effects?  How does global climate change come into play?  \\n	Beginning with defining asthma and what it does to the body, the reader can better understand asthma as a chronic illness that “constricts airways and makes them swollen, filling with mucus. Your chest feels tight -- you may cough or wheeze -- and you just can't seem to catch your breath. In severe cases, asthma attacks can be deadly” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Furthermore, the Natural Resources Defense Council found that asthma kills approximately “5,000 people every year in America” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  It has been proven that people residing in poorer areas, with little sanitation, and both young children, and the elderly, are vulnerable subgroups to climate change and its effects on asthma.  \\n	Beginning with the world’s poorest populations, the Practical Action organization found that the world’s poorest people are the hardest hit by climate change due to devastating droughts, floods, and other weather events (PracticalActionOnline).  Furthermore, Practical Action proclaims that there is a massive injustice present since “climate change is caused by the world’s richest countries” (PracticalActionOnline).  Since poor countries lack the financial means and strong voice to rise up against rich countries’ plans, which may have a debilitating effect on the earth’s environment, and further leads to climate change and the influx of asthmatic symptoms, these poor nations bear the burden of climate change.  \\n	According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the persistence of certain diseases, such as asthma, depend largely on climate change (EPAOnline).  The extreme temperature changes that we have experienced cause a great loss of life, particularly on the elderly.  Additionally, the extreme high temperature changes can “increase air and water pollution, which in turn harm human health” (EPAOnline).  Furthermore, the EPA explains that “climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can indirectly impact the incidence of serious infectious diseases” (EPAOnline).  \\nIt is important to note that the “extent and nature of climate change impacts on human health vary by region, by relative vulnerability of population groups, by the extent and duration of exposure to climate change itself and by society’s ability to adapt to or cope with the change” (EPAOnline).  By being exposed to these extreme climate changes, people are more inclined to contract diseases, such as asthma.  Climate change is expected to contribute to some air quality problems.  \\n	 Respiratory disorders, such as asthma, are more prevalent as the climate changes in extreme manners.  The four main air pollutants that trigger asthma are as follows: Ground Level Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide, Particulate Matter, and Nitrogen Oxide.  Beginning with Ground Level Ozone, it is a “toxic component of smog…that is produced at ground level when tailpipe pollution from cars and trucks reacts with oxygen and sunlight” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Ground level ozone is most common in city-like environments.  People living in cities, which are known to be less sanitary than suburban areas, are predominantly poor and thus lack the means to move to areas with better air quality.  The cities are filled with buses and cars emitting harmful gases into the air and thus harming people in the near surroundings. \\n	Sulfur Dioxide is a “respiratory irritant…that is produced when coal and crude oil are burned” ( NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  As mentioned previously, cities are filled with objects emitting harmful gases into the air, and sulfur dioxide is quite prevalent in city-like living areas.  Sulfur Dioxide is emitted from coal-fired power plants.  Unfortunately, “one in five Americans lives within 10 miles of a coal-fired power plant” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  The fact that so many Americans live in such a close proximity of the coal-fired power plants goes to show that poor people do not have a great advantage at living in sufficient living conditions.\\n	Particulate matters are tiny particles in the air.  They come from a wide range of pollutants, such as dust, soot, and diesel exhaust particles (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  If these small particles are suspended from the air and into the lungs, then an asthma symptom can be triggered; thus affecting the asthmatic.  Approximately, “81 million people live in areas that fail to meet national air quality standards for particulate matter” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Coal-fired power plants and diesel vehicles are major emitters of particulate matter and thus further prove that people residing in poor living conditions are affected more than people living in more affluent areas.\\n	Finally, Nitrogen Oxide is a “gas emitted from tailpipes and power plants…it contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone and smog” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Furthermore, Nitrogen Oxide, when mixed with other air pollutants, form small particles that can trigger asthma.

These impacts arise not only from raw materials and component purchases, supplier manufacturing processes or logistics aarangements, but can also include final product disposal and even the siting of supplier plants. Given the strategic importance and the scale of organisational buying, a range of possibilities for environmental initiatives exist in the supply chain. These begin with the product, component or raw material to be purchased, where the buying company could stipulate minimum standards that the purchased product has to fulfil.\\nFor example, a paper-maker can insist the woodpulb in buys conforms to recognised standards of forest management rather than being made from clear-cutting an entire forest, or an electronic company can require its supplier to avoid certain harmful heavy metals in the supplied products. Other product based environmental initiatives can aim at by products of supplied input such as recycling packaging or reducing waste.
Why Donate Blood ?\\n\\nBlood is the living fluid that all life is based on.\\nBlood is composed of 60% liquid part and 40% solid part. The liquid part called Plasma, made up of 90% water and 10% nutrients, hormones, etc. is easily replenished by food, medicines, etc.\\nBut the solid part that contains RBC (red blood cells), WBC (white blood cells) and Platelets take valuable time to be replaced if lost.\\nThis is where you come in. The time taken by a patient's body to replace it could cost his/her life. Sometimes the body might not be in a condition to replace it at all.\\nAs you know blood cannot be harvested it can only be donated. This means only you can save a life that needs blood.\\nEvery year India requires 40 million units of 250cc blood out of which only a meager 500,000 of blood units are available. Saving a life does not require heroic deeds.\\nYou could just do it with a small thought and an even smaller effort by saying "yes".
 History is the study of the past, with special attention to the written record of the activities of human beings over time. Scholars who write about history are called historians. It is a field of research which uses a narrative to examine and analyse the sequence of events, and it often attempts to investigate objectively the patterns of cause and effect that determine events.[1][2] Historians debate the nature of history and the lessons history teaches.[1][3][4] A famous quote by George Santayana has it that "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."[5] The stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the legends surrounding King Arthur) are usually classified as cultural heritage rather than the "disinterested investigation" needed by the discipline of histna
== Environment ==\\n\\n''ENVIRONMENT''\\nThe Environment The impact of people on their environment can be devastating. This is where the respective role of governments can make decisions that shape environmental policy and responsibilities. These governments can be broken up into four different levels: local, state, federal and international. Air quality and biodiversity are two current issues that can be related to the role of governments. Global warming is also another implication that has a devastating effect on the environment. Current examples include the rise in sea levels, polar meltdowns, the melting of ice sheets and glaciers and human deaths due to disease from the effects of global warming. Firstly the environment can be defined as the natural features of our surroundings such as plant and animal life and their habitats, water, soils and the atmosphere. A local government named Rockdale Municipal Council has implemented certain actions to deal with the quality in that region. They have recognized that the main source of poor air quality originates from air pollution sources such as motor vehicles, industrial premises and aircraft emissions. The solutions to these problems include improvements to Ryde and Botany Bay cycle way, integration of land use and transport planning strategies, production of Air Quality - the Facts booklet for community, investigation of complaints regarding odours and dust, tree planting and preparation of a Local Air Quality Management Plan in 1999. Air quality is a major issue in most states within Australia that affects our greenhouse, to tackle the implications state governments have created policies and responsibilities. For instance Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) is a program that enables mainly state governments to take action on greenhouse. CCP provides these state governments with a strategic framework to diminish greenhouse gas emissions by helping them identify and recognize the emissions of their council and community, set a reduction goal and develop and utilize an action plan to reach that goal. State actions include: capturing the methane from landfill sites and public and non-car transport into urban planning. On a federal or national basis Australia has employed policies to increase the air quality. For example the Commonwealth Government will guarantee that Australia carries its fair-share of the burden in worldwide efforts to combat global air pollution through policy development and implementation. They have also supported the National Greenhouse Strategy (NGS) which began in late 1996. The government will also support the development of a national strategy to observe and manage air toxics. The air toxics strategy will monitor, establish the levels of community exposure to, and manage emissions of selected air toxics. The federal government will even consider the inclusion of air toxics in a future National Environmental Protection Measure. Further measures include the leading of the development of national ambient air quality standards through the National Environmental Protection Council and the assistance of the establishment of a National Pollutant Inventory which will require large companies to publicly report their emission of 90 pollutants. Local government Rockdale Municipal Council has introduced responsibilities and policies to reduce the loss of biodiversity. This local government has learned that the cause involves the introduction of species, pollution of land and water, weed invasion and urban encroachment. Their solutions to these problems comprise of the planting of over 3,500 plants and shrubs in Bardwell Valley and Scotts Reserve, bush regeneration and planting in Scarborough Reserve, involvement in Cooks River Foreshores Working Party and preparation of a flora and fauna study in 2000. Policies towards the community include controlling noxious weeds on your property, planting native trees indigenous to the area and applying to the council prior to removing any trees. The Labor Tasmanian Government has created a new Environment Policy on biodiversity that hopes to preserve native plants and animals. The policies commit the government to encourage community involvement in biological diversity programs, proclaim the Tasman National Park, establish a State Biodiversity Committee with community representation to arrange a Tasmanian Biodiversity Strategy, support the development of a State Policy on the protection of remnant native vegetation, examine the possibility of incorporating the Biodiversity Strategy into legislation and seeking the co-operation of local government and the community in including and enforcing biological diversity guidelines in development criteria. The federal government has enabled several policies to deal with conservation of Australia's biodiversity. The government will support the National Reserve System program to expand Australia's National Parks, support off-reserve biodiversity conservation including the planting of trees and the protection of vegetation through the Bushcare program and work with the States to reduce unsustainable land clearing, develop an alert list of introduced plants and animals that pose a risk to our environment. The government will also maintain a ban on the export of live fauna; support research into Australia's floral and fauna assemblages as well as biodiversity conservation methods and ratify the Desertification Convention. An international conference held in Kyoto, Japan in December 1997 discussed issues on how best to reduce global warming. Kyoto Protocol negotiations have reached a legally binding agreement limiting the amount of gas emissions all industrialized countries. The protocol also included provisions for emission trading between industrialized countries. The overall nominal effect of the Kyoto protocol is for a reduction of 5.2% of emissions by 2010. However the agreement has many flaws and could lead to emission rising above 1990 levels. The protocol specifies that Japan must reduce emissions by 6%, USA by 7% and the European Union by 8%. The chairman of the conference negotiators, Raul Estrada said that further discussions were needed to find a way of implementing a system of trading in emissions. Trading allows countries that produce high levels of greenhouse gases, such as the USA,to buy the right to retain or even increase emissions. 15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)~~\\nGlobal warming refers to an expected rise in global average temperature due to the continued emission of greenhouse gases produced by industry and agriculture which trap heat in the atmosphere. Higher temperatures are expected to be accompanied by changing patterns of precipitation frequency and intensity, changes in soil moisture and a rise of the global sea level. To assess current examples relating to global warming, an examination is first needed on these examples. Sea levels could rise six feet and up in future centuries. The entire Amazon rainforest will be lost if the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases by more than 50%. But no matter whatever action the world takes to stop global warming, sea levels are set to rise and wipe out several island nations. The worst news is that whatever governments do to cut emissions, sea levels will rise by at least 2 metres over the next few hundred years, devastating Tuvalu and Kiribati in the Pacific and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean. Low-lying farmland and cities occupied by hundreds of millions of people will also be engulfed. Robert Nicholls of Middlesex University in London stated that thermal expansion of the ocean will continue for many hundreds of years after CO2 is stabilized, due to the gradual penetration of heat deeper and deeper into the ocean. All around the world ice sheets and glaciers are melting at a rate quite remarkably since record keeping began. A worldwide institute, based in Washington DC says that glaciers and other features are particularly sensitive to temperature shifts, and that scientists suspect the enhanced melting is among the first observable signs of human induced global warming. Some of the effects of global warming are as follows: arctic ocean sea ice shrunk by 6% since 1978, with a 14% loss of thicker year round ice, Greenland ice sheet has thinned by more than a metre a year on its southern and eastern edges since 1993 and 22% of glacial ice volume on the Tien Shan mountains has disappeared in the last 40 years. Worldwatch declared that the Earth's ice cover reflects much of the sun's heat back into space and the loss of much of it would affect the global, raise sea levels, and threaten water supplies. They also stated that the land and water left revealed by the retaining ice would themselves retain heat, creating a feedback loop that would speed up the warming process. The institute pronounced that the world's glaciers, taken as a whole, are now shrinking faster than they are growing. Worldwatch also warns of the outcomes of retaining ice on wildlife. In northern Canada reports of hunger and weight loss among polar bears have been associated with ice cover changes. And in Antarctica, sea loss, rising air temperatures and increased condensation are altering the habitats and the feeding and breeding patterns of seals and penguins. Cornell University ecologists believe that global warming may account for millions of human deaths from disease. David Pimentel a professor of ecology at Cornell stated and assumes that Most of the increase in disease is due to numerous environmental factors, including infectious microbes, pollution by chemicals and biological wastes and shortages of food and nutrients. Global warming will only make matters worse. Global warming will produce a favorable climate for disease producing organisms and plant pests. Global climate change will result in a net loss of obtainable food, for example the decline in rainfall (due to global warming) causes crop and plant production to die out. Infectious disease and environmental factors are to blame for more than 75% of all deaths in the world. Environmental disease may comprise of organic and chemical pollutants, including smoke from tabacco and wood sources. More than three billion people are malnourished. Malnutrition increases vulnerability to pollution-related illnesses and diseases such as diarrhea. Therefore Pimental concluded, we're seeing the first signs that global climate change can influence the incidences of human disease. And that this change combined with population growth and environmental degradation, will probably intensify world malnutrition and increases in other diseases as well. Melting is taking on vast and unprecedented level in the Arctic sea ice, the Antarctic and in dozens of mountain and sub-polar glaciers, and the rate has accelerated immensely in the past decade. The Earth's ice cover could have intense changes on the global climate and rising sea levels could start regional flooding. Melting of mountain glaciers could also endanger urban water supplies and the habitats of plant and animal species in fragile environments. Within the next 35 years, the Himalayan glacial area is expected to shrink by one-fifth, to just 100, 000 kilometres. A prediction forecasts that the remaining glaciers could disappear in 30 years. The melting has been especially noticeable in the past three decades, and scientists believe that it is the result of human behaviour and the build up of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. All current examples of global warming are significant due to the effects that it has on the environment and people. For people, it can cause infectious diseases and pollution-related illnesses that in turn effect our standard of living. Some examples can be more significant than others. For example diseases amongst people is more so important than the rise in sea levels and melting of glaciers since peoples existence are endangered\\n\\n		\\n		\\n		\\nIn Your Home – Conserve Energy \\n1.

Its effects and causes have been on the rise and people need to do something about it before the problem gets any worse. Global warming is an increase in the earth's temperature, which can be caused by the use of fossil fuels, and industrial or agricultural processes. Man-made emissions are adding to the amount of carbon dioxide already being naturally released. These harmful processes have been leading to a large increase in the buildup of "greenhouse gases," which are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. Up until the industrial revolution the world did not have such a terrifying problem of dealing with the buildup of harmful gases in the atmosphere but now with the increasing population growth, increased fossil fuel burning, and.....

Silver was probably one of the first metals smelted from ore. Silver goes back to the times of the ancient Byzantine, Phoenician and Egyptian empires. Other than jewelry, silver has been forged into domestic utensils, buttons, boxes and other articles. Other than liquid mercury, silver is the brightest reflector among metals. This allows it to be polished to sheen. The Latin word for silver is Ag - Argentum that stands for 'white and shining'.\\n\\nAncient silver jewelry was handed down the generations among North and South American natives. Silver is extensively mined in the ores of Mexico and Peru. The comparatively low price of silver makes it a popular metal for jewelry, especially for fine and innovative designs. Silver jewelry craftsmen experiment with silver and later duplicate their patterns with gold.\\n\\nSilver jewelry is popular with women who want to achieve a less-formal look. Silver jewelry is popularly gifted to women and children. Even men can be gifted silver cuff links, tiepins or signet rings. It is representative of a tender emotion or a lovely memory. Sterling silver jewelry carries a stamp of sophistication without being over the top. Find out how to care for your silver jewelry.
Lesotho is one of the poorest countries in the world and is classified as a Least Developed Country. The apparel industry is the largest employer in Lesotho. It has been built on the preferential trade opportunities created by the US Growth & Opportunity Act (AGOA) and is working on moving up the value chain to create a niche market as an ethical sourcing destination.\\n    The Apparel Lesotho Alliance to Fight AIDS (ALAFA) is an industry-wide programme providing prevention and treatment for the 46000 mainly women workers in the industry. This is helping to combat two of the key drivers of the HIV/AIDS edpidemic: poverty and gender inequality. Surveys within the industry show that 43% of employees are HIV-postive.\\n    The creation of ALAFA was driven by humanitarian concerns and the need to make the industry sustainable in the long term.

\\nLove is an emotion of a strong affection and personal attachment.[1] Love is also a virtue representing all of human kindness, compassion, and affection; and "the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another".[2] Love may also be described as actions towards others or oneself based on compassion, or as actions towards others based on affection.[3] In English, love refers to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from pleasure ("I loved that meal") to interpersonal attraction ("I love my partner"). "Love" may refer specifically to the passionate desire and intimacy of romantic love, to the sexual love of eros, to the emotional closeness of familial love, to the platonic love that defines friendship,[4] or to the profound oneness or devotion of religious love.[5] This diversity of uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states. Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts.[6] Love may be understood as part of the survival instinct, a function to keep human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.
'''Introduction:'''\\n\\nFlood is a common phenomenon in Bangladesh. Flood related crises have a gender dimension and affect women, the silent gender, more than men, who have the least capacity to deal with the situation for a variety of cultural, economical, historical, political and social reasons. Floods hit women harder, not just because they are physically weaker, but because of their reproductive capacity, physical responsibility for children and vulnerable socio-economic status. The patriarchal social structure and norms, gendered economics and gendered culture of Bangladesh, underpinned by religious traditions restrict the mobility of women during floods. Wider household responsibilities of women like food processing and cooking, cleaning, collecting water and fuel, bearing and rearing children looking after livestock and income generation also become much more difficult to perform under flood conditions. This article is attempted to highlight how women become more vulnerable by their social status, both during and after the full impact of floods and also the strategies adopted by flood victim women, which are crucial for the household survival.\\n\\n\\n'''Flood and its causes:'''\\n\\nThe origins of floods in Bangladesh are diverse. Floodwater may come from three main sources:\\n\\n	Rivers\\n	Rainfall\\n	Sea\\n\\nThree together or independently, may all generate more water that can’t be drained quickly from the land. However, the specific causes of floods vary from region to region. Several explanations have been addressed here:\\n\\n	Confluence of the major rivers\\n	High monsoon rainfall\\n	Rise of sea level\\n	Siltation of rivers\\n	Flood control measures\\n	Deforestation\\n	Construction of Farakka barrage and others\\n\\nThe last three causes, flood control measures, deforestation and the construction of Farakka barrage, are not only due to natural environmental factors but also to social factors.\\n\\n'''Flood control measures and women:'''\\n\\nIn Bangladesh embankments have been used as a traditional flood control measure since long time. However, a number of studies and reports have pointed out the negative consequences of Flood Control and Drainage (FCD) and Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation (FCDI) projects: the benefits of these projects were not planned. Because such projects are often not based on the nature of the flood plain, they do not prevent flood but rather increase flood losses. Many embankments have had a negative effect on river regimes, land formation, agriculture and fisheries and on the overall environment. Researchers have pointed out that any step to control flooding should emphasize both the structural and non-structural methods. They have discussed the problems of floods and the negative consequences upon the environment, farmers (men), and fisheries and on many other aspects of life in Bangladesh. However, they have ignored the problems of women. There has been almost no discussion of the differential impact of flooding upon men and women and very little about its impact upon people in different socio-economic categories. Policy makers, however, have only recently started to think about the way in which women might be involved in different activities from men and have different experiences of flooding from men, They have agreed that women’s activities should be ‘visible’ in the development sector and therefore, should be integrated with development activities in the water sector (The Fourth Five Year Plan, 1995). There are only a few studies (e. g. Adnan, 1990; Hanchett, 1992) which briefly consider the situation of women during floods. FAP 14’s gender study was based on a few case studies of female-headed households and was not compared with men’s response.\\n\\n'''Problems faced by women during floods:'''\\n\\nDuring floods women face different types of problems. For example:\\n\\n	Women suffer from lack of food, clothing and shelter during floods. Owing to their lack of resources, poor women face greater problems than women in middle and rich households. They suffer from shortages of food and other essentials, resulting in increasing prices and a consequent decline in purchasing power. They often have to eat unusual food and adjust consumption patterns of this.\\n\\n	Unemployed men often sit idle or move elsewhere leaving their household members behind during floods. It is women, the household-based workers, who have to take responsibility for protecting their houses, children and other members of the family, livestock and belongings.\\n\\n	Traditional gender specific work, such as carrying water, cooking, caring for children and animals become too difficult for women during flood conditions. Especially gender-assigned tasks like procuring food and providing drinking water, storing fuel and child care are such that women have to bear more physical burden of coping than men do. \\n\\n	Women’s assets such milch cows, poultry, trees, kitchen and utensils are particularly vulnerable to flood.\\n\\n	Domestic violence also increases during floods. Husbands beat their wives and children when food-supply run out in flood-stricken households.\\n\\n	Many women often become unwilling to go to flood shelters because of the Muslim culture ‘purdah’ which means that women should not show themselves to unrelated men.\\n\\n	During floods poor widow women confine to their houses for many days and have to drink flood water as they have neither the physical strength to reach tube wells, nor the economic means to hire a boat to collect clean water.\\n\\n	Bangladeshi women wear long 'Shari', which hinders their movement from one place to another during floods. It often entangles in fixed debris and limits the speed of evacuation. Again, poor women with only one Shari are often oblige to remain in wet cloth for most of the days for the lack of private space and to dry off.\\n\\n	Victim women often don’t have cloths to come out to take relief. Again, many women lose their breast-feeding infants in flood and suffer from puffed breast pain. There also happen cases of miscarriage which don’t get proper medication during floods. Pregnant and lactating women suffer from malnutrition i.e. lack of vitamin A, iodine and iron deficiencies, which result in eye diseases, night blindness, anemia, goiter etc.\\n\\n	In flood shelters women face several problems, which are related to their gender identity. For example, it becomes impossible for women to disregard their inhibition and go to latrines, which are open to all. They often have to wait till dark/night to ensure privacy to response the calls by nature, even changing the clothes/sanitary pad with menstrual blood.\\n\\n	While distributing relief in shelters, women are often pushed down and left behind in the rush by men. Again, child care, illness and conservatism keep many women away from taking relief goods. Women also give part of their food ration to their children consequently denying themselves the opportunity to maintain their strength and support their families.\\n\\n	Women who are in their own for whatever reason, whether they are single, widowed, abandoned, unaccompanied, lone heads of households or who have been separated from male family members by the chaos of the flood situations, often become victim of sexual violence in flood shelters.\\n\\n	Women are further vulnerable to the secondary impacts of floods due to socio-cultural and economic factors. When resources such as temporary shelter, fresh water, food and medicines are distributed, women are again marginalized. For example, in many cases women are unable to make decisions about whether loans should be secured to rebuild homes or to purchase crop seeds or other means to generate an income such as the purchase of a boat for transporting goods.        \\n\\n'''Coping mechanisms of women during floods:'''\\n\\nFloods affect both women and men but the burden of coping with flood falls heavily on women. The tasks women perform before, during and after floods, the problems they face and the coping mechanisms they adopt are related to women’s gender identity. Women in poorer categories often act as men do in making platforms, cutting bamboo, making bamboo bridges protecting crops and livestock and engaging in income generating activities. On the other hand, men usually remain more restricted to their gender-assigned activities. Some of the coping mechanisms of women have been highlighted here.\\n'''\\nWomen and water collection:'''\\n\\nThe collection of water during floods causes great problems for women. Women are usually responsible for collecting and storing water. During floods tube-wells, the most common source of pure drinking water in Bangladesh, go under water and poor women have to take considerable risks to procure drinking water from great distances. They have to walk through chest-high water or swim to collect fresh or clean water. Again, they have not enough fuel to boil water or fitciri to purify it with alum. However, they help each other to get pure drinking water from different sources.\\n\\n'''Sale of women’s assets:'''\\n\\nThe sale of assets is a common way for rural households to survive any crisis. Non-productive assets like milking cows or goats, jewellery or household items cannot usually produce a continuous income as land or cattle but they can easily be converted to cash and are therefore the first to be disposed off to meet the immediate needs of family survival. These assets usually belong to women, and they are often their only assets. They are sold, or mortgaged by their husbands to repay loans, to educate sons or to maintain the livelihood of the households. Both women and men resist changing their status from farmer to landless as long as they have other options to cope with crisis. Most women don’t have own valuable assets as men do. Even if they have some assets they are considered ‘less valuable’ or ‘non-productive’. However, women’s ‘non-productive’ assets become more ‘productive’ when they are disposed off during floods. Women’s assets are used to meet the immediate needs of the households during floods when men’s assets are kept for the future. \\n\\n'''Women and food preparation:'''\\n\\nDuring floods there is a great difference in the kind of food, the amount and the frequency of food preparation and the sources of food among women in different socio-economic categories. The food supplies of the poor, undernourished and malnourished at the best of times, are further reduced during the floods and it is women who have the responsibility for adjusting the household food consumption. Women’s work is closely related with agricultural production, family food and income generation and that is why the burden of food shortage falls upon them.\\n\\nMost of the poor households don’t have a reliable and stable source of food during floods. Women in these categories play a vital role in acquiring food from many sources, some of which are totally different from flood-free sources. When there is a shortage they try to manage food through their own efforts by gathering edible or wild plants and small amounts of low quality food such as rotten or discarded vegetables or accepting rice gruel from better-off women. Destitute and landless women maintain their livelihood by a hand-to-mouth existence. During floods the normal pattern of food consumption in the household changes. The price of staple food items becomes so high that it goes beyond the purchasing power of the poor. So, they often cook khesari or kalai dal (kind of inferior pulse), mania or cheer paddy, which they consider to be animal food, curry with fen (rice gruel) and chhatu (flour normally made of barley or chickpea or maize), kura (the red powdery coating of rice under the husk), lumps of flour burnt in the fire, one handful of rice with lots of water and chili, fried broken bits of grain and different aquatic plants. It is also evident that both women and men in poorer categories suffer from food shortages and women commonly sacrifice their own meals for their husbands and children.\\n\\n''' \\nWomen and common village resources:'''\\nDuring floods women become undernourished subsisting on a lean diet of vegetables, creepers and herbs. Their dependence on food from the common land increases greatly. When men fail to earn any money, they become helpless and do not feel it incumbent upon them to find alternative source of food for their families. Women, on the other hand, are much more capable than men of collecting food for families. They usually collect variety of food items from village common land like Shapla (the stem of the water lily) which women use as a major food item and is often mixed with others like kolmi shak (arum leaves) or kochumukhi (wild arum). \\n\\n'''Women and family health care:'''\\n\\nThere are some general flood-diseases, such as, diarrhea, viral fever, jaundice, skin diseases, conjunctivitis and swelling of limbs. It is evident that without any healthcare facilities from government or other organizations during floods, it is women who provide health care for the sick. Only women have knowledge about certain medicinal trees and they use herbs, roots and barks to cure family members from different types of diseases. Poorer women take risks to collect medicinal herbs from distant places during the floods despite purda restrictions. Men, on the other hand, rarely do such work because providing herbal treatment or nursing is not their gender-assigned role. Men in poorer categories also do not have the resources to get modern treatment. However, most women in the poorer categories, despite their own sickness and other activities, try their best to cure sick family members themselves in order to avoid the cost of modern treatment.\\n\\n'''Women and social network:'''\\n\\nWith little or no support from the government during floods, the women of poor households sick help from their social networks. Such support mainly comes from their own and that of their husbands’ kin and sometimes from patrons and neighbors. Women are able to get more support from such relationships than men. Relatives and neighbors provide shelter, lend food, supply loans with little or no interest, provide temporary employment and help with money, labor or materials to rebuild houses after floods. Men, on the other hand, do not show such ability to provide for their households. Borrowing small things or food is not a man’s responsibility and asking for help is often considered below their dignity.\\n\\n'''Recommendations:'''\\n\\nDuring floods where people as a whole are vulnerable, women are more vulnerable as they bear the burden of managing the survival of the household. Therefore, special attention should be given on after-flood rehabilitation program for women. For example:\\n\\n	There should be more female volunteers. In the case of major floods, male volunteers can not adequately meet women’s needs. \\n\\n	Women relief workers face higher security risks and obstructive ness from local male leaders and government officials when trying to carry out their work. More women volunteers should be available to form a strong group, able to overcome these problems collectively.\\n\\n	Female doctors and nurses should be included in the volunteer team, alongside a male medical team. Emergency medicine and equipment should be available to cope with women’s needs. For example, many women lost their breast-feeding infants during floods. Pumps to express breast milk must be available, in order to avoid serious infection and debilitating pain. Equipment and medication is needed to handle the inevitable miscarriages. \\n\\n	Poor women generally know fewer languages. So, local volunteers are needed to overcome language problems, in order to get access to the women more easily and to understand their specific needs.\\n\\n	During relief distribution women should be given first priority, and a separate distribution line needs to be organized for them as they have the additional responsibility for children.\\n\\n	In particularly conservative areas women may need house-to-house distribution as they face social obstacles to come to the distribution line to compete in the struggle for food supplies, elbowing and pushing, with men.\\n\\n\\n	As women must be fully clothed to go out to get food, clothing is an essential part of emergency relief.\\n     \\n'''Conclusion:'''\\n\\nThe inclusion of gender perspective in the study of flood is very pertinent and justified considering the context of Bangladesh. During floods where people as a whole are vulnerable, women become more vulnerable who bear the burden of managing the survival of household under crisis. Therefore, for effective flood management programs to be conceived and implemented successfully, gender specific awareness must be fully realized and accounted for. Since many women become disoriented and threatened by the loss of their homes, flood management policies need to be sensitive and aware of the meaning and significance of home and the implications for dealing with female flood victims. To reduce the vulnerability of women during floods specific programs should be devised and implemented that raise the awareness of women to the risks they face and also the range of adjustments that they can make. Such programs also need to be culturally and socially sensitive. Because of women’s significant contributions to their households’ survival during floods, their activities need to receive attention in government planning. \\n\\n \\n'''Bibliography:''' \\n\\nAhsan, Rosie Majid and Khatun.

Author: Eastine Charles Taneo\\n\\nDate published: March 10, 2012\\n\\n                       Deforestation has important implications for life on this planet. The transformation of forested lands by human actions represents one of the great forces in global environmental change and one of the great drivers of biodiversity loss. The impact of people has been and continues to be profound. Forests are cleared, degraded and fragmented by timber harvest, conversion to agriculture, road-building, fire, and in other ways. The effort to use and subdue the forest has been a constant theme in the transformation of the earth, in many societies, in many lands, and at most times. \\n\\n                       Forests are habitats and shelters to millions of species, reduce flooding, soil conserver, provide products for human use and consumption, give valuable ecosystem services.  They are home to more than half of all species living on land.  They also play several roles in the flooding because trees hold and use more water than farms or grasslands. With enough water, the river must rise above its banks and flood. The faster water runs from the watershed into the river, the higher a flood will be. Tree roots hold the soil in place, reducing the movement of sediment that can shrink river channels downstream and it can prevent soil erosion. Forests provide useful wood products.  Roundwood can be processed into building materials, or made into plywood products, furniture, etc. \\n\\n                       The following are factors of deforestation: logging, fires, urban construction, agriculture and commercial purposes.\\n\\n \\n\\n                     The first factor of deforestation is logging. Logging, both legal and illegal, is the cutting, skidding of trees in the forest. It is one of the major causes of deforestation in the world today. Trees that are cut-down are usually used by humans to trade. The logs are then generally transported to a saw mill to be cut into timber, a paper mill for paper pulp, of for other purposes like fence posts (Glastra, 1999). Logging is also tagged to the term “clearcutting”. It is a harvest method that removes essentially all the standing trees in a selected area (Glastra, 1999). A “clearcut” may or may not have reserve trees left to attain goals other than regeneration.\\n\\n                        There are different logging methods applied and some of these are “tree-length logging”, “full-tree logging”, and “cut-to-length logging”. Tree-length logging is a mechanized form of logging that involves felling and topping trees at the stump inside the cutblock or by the roadside (Wiki, 2009). The felled trees are then transported to the roadside or a landing site for hauling to a mill. Full-tree length is defined as trees are felled and transported to roadside with branches and top intact (Pulkki, no date). Transporting trees to the roadside is mainly by cable or grapple skidders. Cut-to-length method is trees are cut-off above the stump with stump height less than one-half butt diameter and bucked to various assortments directly in the stump area.\\n\\n                       The second factor of deforestation is fire. Forest fire is often used to signify an uncontrolled intense fire that breaks out in the wooded areas, grasslands, bushes, scrublands and peats due to many factors ranging from natural to man-made causes. It can easily spread to a vast area. It can also change its direction and overcome barriers like rivers and roads. Some of the causes of forest fires are natural such as lightning, and human activities and negligence like camp fire, lighted cigarettes (Bora, 2011) and kaingin system. Natural causes like lightning burns the trees and fire easily spread into the area.  About 14% of forest fires are due to lightning strikes (Dunn, 2009). Human activities and negligence are about 86% of forest fires (Dunn, 2009). Tourists or smokers sometimes leave camp fires or drop lighted items like cigarettes and matches in the forests which can easily set nearby bushes on fire and further develops into huge forest fire. On the other hand, kaingin or “slash-and-burn farming” system is an agricultural technique which involves intentional cutting and burning of trees in the forests to create fields. It includes a diverse collection of farming systems from long fallow shifting cultivation to short fallow shifting cultivation to forest pioneer farming. Unlike traditional farming methods that were used in harmony with the forests recuperative capacity, current slash-and-burn farming depletes the very soil resource upon which all agriculture and forestry depend. One of the strong commonalities of all slash-and-burn farmers is that they are among the poorest, most marginalized groups of their societies and have little or no influence on the important land use policy decisions made in their countries.\\n\\n                       The third cause of deforestation is urban construction. Forests are the way for residential houses, building and factories. Roads are building for trading and easier transports. This has made possible the needs of the social groups in the society. The cutting down of trees for lumber that is used for building materials, furniture, and paper products have a major impact on forest life. Forests are cleared to accommodate expanding urban areas.\\n\\n                       The fourth cause of deforestation is converting the forest to agricultural land. Trees in the forests are cut down to clear land for growing crops, build farms, ranches and other food growing lands. The economic consequences of deforestation and the process of becoming peasants are devastating. In contrast to the rich variety of foods the forest people are accustomed to plowing fields and peasants specialize in just four crops: rice, corn, tomatoes, and onions (Schelgel, 1999).  Hunting and fishing and gathering played almost no role at all in the cleared regions. The forests are gone and the rivers and creeks are seriously depleted. Commercial agriculture's role in deforestation is two-fold. First, agribusiness can indirectly result in deforestation. Commercial farms occupy the best and most fertile agricultural soils located in the valleys. This land is not available to the growing rural population that depends on agriculture for their subsistence. Without access to farmland in their immediate area, farming families have had to relocate to less fertile and less productive forested land. Second, agribusiness can be a direct cause of deforestation. Through a concession agreement, land purchase, or an informal land occupation; companies take possession of forested land with the intention of converting it to another use.\\n\\n                       The fifth cause is cattle ranching and livestock grazing. A cattle ranching is a major cause of deforestation. Ranchers occupy large tracts of forests and clear the land themselves or they buy the improvements made by small farmers. Traditionally, ranchers favored the more easily managed range and pasture lands of the dry forest zones, but for the last four decades there has been intensive clearing of the forests. Open-range grazing as is practiced in the dry woodlands can be a major contributor to deforestation when herd populations exceed the carrying capacity of the range. It can also seriously degrade the composition and quality of the forest when practiced too intensively.\\n                       The sixth cause of deforestation is mining and oil exploration that are locally important to deforestation. Large mines consumed vast quantities of indigenous woodlands to supply fuel to their smelting operations before plantations of fast-growing species were established (Lovekar, 2011). Oil exploration activities, such as the clearing of the seismic lines in the forests not only destroy the forests but also open them up to colonization by subsistence farmers who follow the exploration crews. The impact of gold mining has been widely publicized but its negative impacts have affected the indigenous peoples and the quality of the water more than the adjacent forests.\\n\\n                       The effects of deforestation may include loss of topsoil, disruption of the water cycle, loss of biodiversity, loss of potential discoveries, flooding and drought and climate change.\\n\\n                      First effect of deforestation is the loss of topsoil. Deforestation results in rapid degradation of nutrient rich topsoil. Heavy rainfall and high sunlight quickly damage the topsoil in clearings of forests. When these forests are cut-and-burnt, nutrients are released in the form of ash (Schlegel, 1999). This allows for a year or two of good crop on the newly cleared virgin land but eventually the nutrients will be washed away by the heavy tropical rain.\\n\\n                       Second effect of deforestation is the disruption of the water cycle. In the water cycle there are only a few processes that give water back to the atmosphere, such as transpiration, expiration and evaporation. Transpiration is the process by which water is loss from plants to the atmosphere (Starr, 2006). So, if plants are removed, especially at a high rate such as deforestation, there will be less water returning in the atmosphere. This will eventually cause a reduction in the amount of water returning the earth's surface such as the seas, lakes, rivers etc.\\n\\n                       Third effect is the loss of biodiversity. Biodiversity is the sum of all species occupying a specified area during a specified interval, past as well as present (Starr, 2006). Deforestation affects biological diversity by the destruction of natural habitats, which forces species out of their native areas. Isolation and fragmentation restrict their range, forcing them into unnatural and restrictive habitats, which may lead to their extinction. Temperature changes caused by loss of the protective canopy of the forest also contribute to this. Deforestation through clear-cutting creates a patched look to the landscape. Not only is this unpleasant to the eye, but it is terrible to the local wildlife. For other species, fragmented landscapes become population sinks that are sustained by immigration from nearby forest tracts (Schlegel, 1999). \\n\\n                       The fourth effect is the loss of potential discoveries. There is the possibility that the basic elements of potential medical treatments, cures and vaccines may lie undiscovered within these environments. The key active ingredient in one-fourth of the world’s prescription and non-prescription drugs come from plants growing in tropical rain forests. Fewer trees translate into an insecure future for forest workers. Some indigenous peoples’ way of life and survival are threatened by the loss of forests. Often, the stakeholders associated with forest areas are not always consulted before clearcutting occurs. This has sometimes lead to non-violent and violent confrontation and fueled bitter rivalries between area residents, the forest sector and environmentalists.\\n\\n                        The fifth effect is flooding and drought. One of the functions of forests is to absorb and store great amounts of water quickly when there are heavy rains. When the trees are cut down, it will not regulate or hold the flow of the water which leads to flooding and alters to drought. Deforestation causes a lack of soil cohesion and, because tree roots absorb water from the soil and allow it to absorb more water, it creates an ideal environment for flooding. A flat, treeless surface is perfect for flash floods. Flash flood has been the deadliest disaster that struck and killed hundreds of people in the cities of Cagyan de Oro and Iligan (Villanueva, 2011) last December  2011.\\n\\n                       The sixth effect of deforestation is global warming. Global warming is a phenomenon (greenhouse effect) whereby solar radiation that has reflected back off the surface of the earth remains trapped at atmospheric levels, due to the build-up of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, rather than being emitted back into space (Starr, 2006).\\n\\nThe major greenhouse gases and their sources/causes are:\\n\\nCarbon dioxide (CO2)\\n	-Fossil fuel, deforestation, animal respiration.\\n\\nMethane (CH4)\\n	-Cattle, rice paddies, gas leaks, termites, mining\\n\\nNitrous oxide (N2O)\\n	-Burning of fossil fuels, deforestation.\\n\\nChlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)\\n	-Air conditioning, solvents                             \\n\\nOzone (O3) and other trace gases\\n	-Car exhaust, power plants, photochemicals. \\n\\n\\n                       Global temperature is also rising. Different studies have shown the world’s average temperature has risen by 0.5o F-1.0o F on an average (Lovekar, 2011). The rise in the mean surface air temperature over the past hundred years supports this long term estimate. It is unknown whether the rise is part of Earth’s natural climate cycle or a result of the increase in greenhouse gases from human activity. A study in Canada, analyzing ground surface temperature, has found a one to two degree increase in ground surface temperature at the time of deforestation at each site (Swemson, 2011).\\n\\n                        The possible ways to protect and preserve the forests may include the following: reforestation, educating the farmers about deforestation, strict implementation of law about the problem, sustainable forest and water management.\\n\\n                       The first way is reforestation. It is causing a forest to occur again. This can be done by letting deforested land go fallow for several years or by replanting native species in open areas or adjacent to remaining forest. Here in Mindanao, some government and non-government organizations are doing tree planting projects. They plant trees to lessen the effect of climate change and recover what has been damaged by logging in the forest. The Philippine government supplies the seedlings but according to Pres. Benigno Aquino III there is an inadequate supply of seedlings that we could use in the country (Porcalla, 2011).\\n\\n                       The second way is educating the farmers.  There are peasant farmers who have left their traditional farm lands in search of new opportunities on the forest frontier. With a growing local population, restricted access to arable land, and few economic alternatives they have been forced to migrate to forested state lands to establish a new farm and homestead. They become prisoners of illiteracy and endemic poverty, and driven by the lack of access to arable lands and the lack of alternative employment opportunities, subsistence farming families must survive by clearing the forests to plant their crops. Though education, they can be responsible farmers. They must know the importance of our forests. The government may also give them alternative source of income like sustainable livelihood projects instead of clearing the forest to be converted in agricultural lands.\\n\\n                       The third way is the strict implementation of the laws concerning about deforestation. The authorities must strictly impose penalties to the one who breaks the law. Here in our country, Philippines, these are examples of the law of our government to fight deforestation: DENR Memorandum No. 52 and Executive Order No. 23.\\n\\n                      DENR(Department of Environment and Natural Resources) Memorandum No. 52 is limiting the processing of application permits of forest tenure holders within their plantation sites only (Villanueva, 2011). Environment and Natural Resources Ramon Paje announced last year, 2011, that chainsaws, bulldozers graders, and other logging tools and implements are now off-limits in natural and residual forests nationwide.\\n\\n                       Executive Order No. 23 is declaring a logging ban. President Benigno Aquino III issued the ban after visiting the provinces hit by floods and landslides in the country.\\n\\n                       The fourth way is sustainable forest and water management. According to Dr. Victor Rex Cruz, dean of the UP College of Forestry and Natural Resources, a sustainable forest management program to put in a place to assure sustainable harvest from natural forest, more investments in plantations and tree industries, and protection of watershed and protected areas while assuring the continuity of forest products and environmental services from all types of forests (Porcalla, 2011).\\n\\n                        Therefore, deforestation has a great impact in our society. It threatens not only biodiversity but it also endangers us humans which should protect the forest. It is true that it gives economic improvement to us but it also gives bad environmental effects. Controlling the problem is not a simple matter of enacting new laws and enforcing new regulations because laws and regulations already exist. What we need to do is to follow and obey this laws and regulations to lessen the bad effects of deforestation. We should be part of the solution and not adding to the problem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n•	Bora, C.

Environmental issues in India are many. Air pollution, water pollution, garbage pollution and wildlife natural habitat pollution challenge India. The situation was worse between 1947 through 1995. According to data collection and environment assessment studies of World Bank experts, between 1995 through 2010, India has made one of the fastest progress in the world, in addressing its environmental issues and improving its environmental quality.[1][2] Still, India has a long way to go to reach environmental quality similar to those enjoyed in developed economies. Pollution remains a major challenge and opportunity for India.\\n\\nSome believe economic development is leading to environmental issues in India. Others believe economic development is key to improving India's environmental management and preventing pollution in India.\\n\\nSome suggest India's growing population is the primary cause of India's environmental degradation. Systematic studies challenge this theory. Empirical evidence from countries such as Japan, England and Singapore, each with population density similar or higher than India, yet each enjoying environmental quality vastly superior than India, suggests population density may not be the only factor affecting India's issues.[3]\\n\\nMajor environmental issues are forest and agricultural degradation of land, resource depletion (water, mineral, forest, sand, rocks etc.), environmental degradation, public health, loss of biodiversity, loss of resilience in ecosystems, livelihood security for the poor.[4]\\n\\nThe major sources of pollution in India include the rampant burning of fuelwood and biomass such as dried waste from livestock as the primary source of energy,[5] lack of organized garbage and waste removal services, lack of sewage treatment operations, lack of flood control and monsoon water drainage system, diversion of consumer waste into rivers, cremation practices near major rivers, government mandated protection of highly polluting old public transport, and continued operation by Indian government of government owned, high emission plants built between 1950 to 1980.[6][7][8][9][10]\\n\\nIndia's water supply and sanitation issues are related to many environmental issues.\\n\\nEnvironmental issues are one of the primary causes of disease, health issues and long term livelihood impact for India.\\nContents\\n [hide] \\n\\n    * 1 History\\n    * 2 Major issues\\n          o 2.1 Population growth and environmental quality\\n    * 3 Pollution\\n          o 3.1 Water pollution\\n          o 3.2 Recent efforts to address water issues\\n          o 3.3 Air pollution\\n          o 3.4 Solid waste pollution\\n          o 3.5 Noise pollution\\n          o 3.6 Land pollution\\n    * 4 Environmental issues and Indian law\\n    * 5 Conservation\\n    * 6 See also\\n    * 7 References\\n    * 8 Further reading\\n    * 9 External links\\n\\n[edit] History\\nAshoka Pillar Edicts were one of earliest efforts in India focussed on respecting and preserving environment, forests and wildlife.\\n\\nYajnavalkya Smriti, a historic Indian text on statecraft and jurisprudence, suggested to have been written before 5th century AD, prohibited the cutting of trees and prescribed punishment for such acts. Kautalya's Arthashastra, written in India's Mauryan period, emphasized the need for forest administration. Ashoka went further, and his Pillar Edicts expressed his view about the welfare of environment and biodiversity.\\n\\n    "Happiness in this world and the next is difficult to obtain without much love for the dhamma, much self-examination, much respect, much fear of evil, and much enthusiasm. [...] Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi (Ashoka), speaks thus: Animals were declared to be protected – parrots, mainas, aruna, geese, wild ducks, nandimukhas, gelatas, bats, queen ants, terrapins, boneless fish, vedareyaka, gangapuputaka, sankiya fish, tortoises, porcupines, squirrels, deer, bulls, okapinda, wild asses, wild pigeons, domestic pigeons and all four-footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible. Also protected were nanny goats, ewes and sows which are with young or giving milk to their young, and so are young ones less than six months old. Cocks are not to be caponized, husks hiding living beings are not to be burnt, and forests are not to be burnt either without reason or to kill creatures. One animal is not to be fed to another. Our king killed very few animals."\\n\\n    — Ashoka's Seven Pillar Edicts[11]\\n\\nBritish rule of India saw several laws related to environment. Amongst the earliest ones were Shore Nuisance (Bombay and Kolaba) Act of 1853 and the Oriental Gas Company Act of 1857. The Indian Penal Code of 1860, imposed a fine on anyone who voluntarily fouls the water of any public spring or reservoir. In addition, the Code penalised negligent acts. British India also enacted laws aimed at controlling air pollution. Prominent amongst these were the Bengal Smoke Nuisance Act of 1905 and the Bombay Smoke Nuisance Act of 1912. While these laws failed in having the intended effect, British-enacted legislations pioneered the growth of environmental regulations in India.\\n\\nUpon independence from Britain, India adopted a constitution and numerous British-enacted laws, without any specific constitutional provision on protecting environment. India amended its constitution in 1976. Article 48(A) of Part IV of the amended constitution, read: The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country. Article 51 A(g) imposed additional environmental mandates on the Indian state.\\n\\nOther Indian laws from recent history include the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1974, the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981. The Air Act was inspired by the decisions made at Stockholm Conference. The Bhopal gas tragedy triggered the Government of India to enact the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986. India has also enacted a set of Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules in 2000.\\n\\nIn 1985, Indian government created the Ministry of Environment and Forests. This ministry is the central administrative organisation in India for regulating and ensuring environmental protection.\\n\\nDespite active passage of laws by the central government of India, the reality of environmental quality mostly worsened between 1947 to 1990. Most of Indian economy was nationalized and owned by India, and regulations were mostly ignored by state run enterprises. Rural poor had no choice, but to sustain life in whatever way possible. The state governments of India often regarded environmental laws enacted by the central government as a mere paperwork formality. Air emissions increased, water pollution worsened, forest cover decreased.\\n\\nStarting in 1990s, reforms were introduced. Since then, for the first time in Indian history, major air pollutant concentrations have dropped in every 5 year period. Between 1992 to 2010, satellite data confirms India's forest coverage has increased for the first time by over 4 million hectares, a 7% increase.[12]\\n[edit] Major issues\\nFloods are a significant environmental issue for India. It causes soil erosion, destruction of wetlands and wide migration of solid wastes.\\n\\nAir pollution, poor management of waste, growing water scarcity, falling groundwater tables, water pollution, preservation and quality of forests, biodiversity loss, and land/soil degradation are some of the major environmental issues India faces today.[13]\\n\\nIndia's population growth adds pressure to environmental issues and its resources.\\n\\nEnvironmental issues in India include various natural hazards, particularly cyclones and annual monsoon floods. An estimated 60% of cultivated land suffers from soil erosion, waterlogging, and salinity. It is also estimated that between 4.7 and 12 billion tons of topsoil are lost annually from soil erosion.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe Indian Agricultural Research Institute of Parvati has estimated that a 3 °C rise in temperature will result in a 15 to 20% loss in annual wheat yields.[citation needed] These are substantial problems for a nation with such a large population depending on the productivity of primary resources and whose economic growth relies heavily on industrial growth. Civil conflicts involving natural resources—most notably forests and arable land—have occurred in eastern and northeastern states.\\n[edit] Population growth and environmental quality\\n\\nThere is a long history of study and debate about the interactions between population growth and the environment. According to the British thinker Malthus, for example, a growing population exerts pressure on agricultural land, causing environmental degradation, and forcing the cultivation of land of poorer and poorer quality. This environmental degradation ultimately reduces agricultural yields and food availability, causes famines and diseases and death, thereby reducing the rate of population growth. Population growth, because it can place increased pressure on the assimilative capacity of the environment, is also seen as a major cause of air, water, and solid-waste pollution. The result, Malthus theorized, is an equilibrium population that enjoys low levels of both income and environmental quality. Malthus suggested positive and preventative forced control of human population, along with abolition of poor laws.\\n\\nMalthus theory, published between 1798 and 1826, has been analyzed and criticized ever since. The American thinker Henry George, for example, observed with his characteristic piquancy in dismissing Malthus: "Both the jayhawk and the man eat chickens; but the more jayhawks, the fewer chickens, while the more men, the more chickens." Similarly, the American economist Julian Lincoln Simon criticised Malthus's theory.[14] He noted that the facts of human history have proven the predictions of Malthus and of the Neo-Malthusians to be flawed. Massive geometric population growth in the 20th century did not result in a Malthusian catastrophe. The possible reasons include: increase in human knowledge, rapid increases in productivity, innovation and application of knowledge, general improvements in farming methods (industrial agriculture), mechanization of work (tractors), the introduction of high-yield varieties of wheat and other plants (Green Revolution), the use of pesticides to control crop pests.[15]\\n\\nMore recent scholarly articles concede that while there is no question that population growth may contribute to environmental degradation, its effects can be modified by economic growth and modern technology.[16] Research in environmental economics has uncovered a relationship between environmental quality, measured by ambient concentrations of air pollutants and per capita income. This so-called environmental Kuznets curve shows environmental quality worsening up until about $5,000 of per capita income on purchasing parity basis, and improving thereafter.[17] The key requirement, for this to be true, is continued adoption of technology and scientific management of resources, continued increases in productivity in every economic sector, entrepreneurial innovation and economic expansion.\\n\\nOther data suggests that population density has little correlation to environmental quality and human quality of life. India's population density, in 2011, was about 368 human beings per square kilometer. Many countries with population density similar or higher than India enjoy environmental quality as well as human quality of life far superior than India. For example: Singapore (7148 /km2), Hong Kong-China (6349 /km2), South Korea (487 /km2), Netherlands (403 /km2), Belgium (355 / km2), Japan (337/ km2), England (395 /km2), the state of Florida (353 / km2), the state of New York (412 / km2), the state of Massachusetts (840 / km2), the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (523 / km2), the region of Île-de-France (974 / km2), and the region of Lombardy (417 / km2).\\n[edit] Pollution\\n[edit] Water pollution\\nSee also: Water supply and sanitation in India\\nHanskhali drainage canal, it passes contaminated water direct to the Ganges at Howrah, West Bengal. Sewage and drainage canals like this are the dominant cause of water pollution in India.\\n\\nA 2007 study finds that discharge of untreated sewage is single most important cause for pollution of surface and ground water in India. There is a large gap between generation and treatment of domestic wastewater in India. The problem is not only that India lacks sufficient treatment capacity but also that the sewage treatment plants that exist do not operate and are not maintained. Majority of the government-owned sewage treatment plants remain closed most of the time due to improper design or poor maintenance or lack of reliable electricity supply to operate the plants, together with absentee employees and poor management. The wastewater generated in these areas normally percolates in the soil or evaporates. The uncollected wastes accumulate in the urban areas cause unhygienic conditions and release pollutants that leaches to surface and groundwater.[18]\\n\\nA 1992 World Health Organization study is claimed to have reported that out of India's 3,119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial sewage treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities.[19] Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. A 1995 report claimed 114 Indian cities were dumping untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River.[20] Open defecation is widespread even in urban areas of India.[21][22] This situation is typical of India as well as other developing countries.\\n\\nAccording to another 2005 report, sewage discharged from cities and towns is the predominant cause of water pollution in India. Investment is needed to bridge the gap between 29000 million litre per day of sewage India generates, and a treatment capacity of mere 6000 million litre per day.[23] A large number of Indian rivers are severely polluted as a result of discharge of domestic sewage.\\n\\nThe Central Pollution Control Board, a Ministry of Environment & Forests Government of India entity, has established a National Water Quality Monitoring Network comprising 1429 monitoring stations in 27 states and 6 in Union Territories on various rivers and water bodies across the country. This effort monitors water quality year round. The monitoring network covers 293 rivers, 94 lakes, 9 tanks, 41 ponds, 8 creeks, 23 canals, 18 drains and 411 wells distributed across India.[24] Water samples are routinely analyzed for 28 parameters including dissolved oxygen, bacteriological and other internationally established parameters for water quality. Additionally 9 trace metals parameters and 28 pesticide residues are analyzed. Biomonitoring is also carried out on specific locations.\\n\\nThe scientific analysis of water samples from 1995 to 2008 indicates that the organic and bacterial contamination are severe in water bodies of India. This is mainly due to discharge of domestic wastewater in untreated form, mostly from the urban centers of India.\\n\\nIn 2008, the water quality monitoring found almost all rivers with high levels of BOD. The worst pollution, in decreasing order, were found in river Markanda (590 mg O/l), followed by river Kali (364), river Amlakhadi (353), Yamuna canal (247), river Yamuna at Delhi (70) and river Betwa (58). For context, a water sample with a 5 day BOD between 1 and 2 mg O/L indicates a very clean water, 3 to 8 mg O/L indicates a moderately clean water, 8 to 20 indicates borderline water, and greater than 20 mg O/L indicates ecologically-unsafe polluted water.\\n\\nThe Mithi River, which flows through the city of Mumbai, is heavily polluted.\\n\\nThe levels of BOD are severe near the cities and major towns. In rural parts of India, the river BOD levels were sufficient to support aquatic life.\\n\\nTotal coliform and fecal coliform densities in the rivers of India range between 500 to 100,000 MPN/100 ml.[24] The presence of coliform suggests that the water is being contaminated with the fecal material of humans, livestocks, pets and other animals. Rivers Yamuna, Ganga, Gomti, Ghaggar, Chambal, Mahi, Vardha are amongst the other most coliform polluted water bodies in India. For context, coliform must be below 104 MPN/100 ml,[25] preferably absent from water for it to be considered safe for general human use, and for irrigation where coliform may cause disease outbreak from contaminated-water in agriculture.[26][27]\\n\\nIn 2006, 47 percent of water quality monitoring stations in India reported a total average annual coliform levels above 500 MPN/100 ml. During 2008, 33 percent of all water quality monitoring stations reported a total coliform levels exceeding those levels, suggesting recent effort to add pollution control infrastructure and upgrade treatment plants in India, may be reversing the water pollution trend.\\n\\nTreatment of domestic sewage and subsequent utilization of treated sewage for irrigation can prevent pollution of water bodies, reduce the demand for fresh water in irrigation sector and become a resource for irrigation. Since 2005, Indian wastewater treatment plant market has been growing annually at the rate of 10 to 12 percent. The United States is the largest supplier of treatment equipment and supplies to India, with 40 percent market share of new installation.[28] At this rate of expansion, and assuming the government of India continues on its path of reform, major investments in sewage treatment plants and electricity infrastructure development, India will nearly triple its water treatment capacity by 2015, and treatment capacity supply will match India's daily sewage water treatment requirements by about 2020.\\n\\nWater resources have not been linked to either domestic or international violent conflict as was previously anticipated by some observers. Possible exceptions, notes a 2004 report, include some communal violence related to distribution of water from the Kaveri River and political tensions surrounding actual and potential population displacements by dam projects, particularly on the Narmada River.[29] A 1997 article claimed Punjab is another hotbed of pollution, for example, Buddha Nullah, a rivulet which run through Malwa region of Punjab, India, and after passing through highly populated Ludhiana district, before draining into Sutlej River, a tributary of the Indus river, is today an important case point in the recent studies, which suggest this as another Bhopal in making.[30]\\n\\nA joint study by PGIMER and Punjab Pollution Control Board in 2008, revealed that in villages along the Nullah, calcium, magnesium, fluoride, mercury, beta-endosulphan and heptachlor pesticide were more than permissible limit (MPL) in ground and tap waters. Plus the water had high concentration of COD and BOD (chemical and biochemical oxygen demand), ammonia, phosphate, chloride, chromium, arsenic and chlorpyrifos pesticide. The ground water also contains nickel and selenium, while the tap water has high concentration of lead, nickel and cadmium.[31] The Hindon River, which flows through the city of Ghaziabad, highly polluted and groundwater of this city has colored and poisoned by industrial effluents, Hindon Vahini is strongly opposing of water pollution activities.\\n\\nFlooding during monsoons worsens India's water pollution problem, as it washes and moves all sorts of solid garbage and contaminated soils into its rivers and wetlands.\\n\\nThe annual average precipitation in India is about 4000 billion cubic metres.[23] From this, with the state of Indian infrastructure in 2005, the available water resource through the rivers is about 1869 billion cubic meters. Accounting to uneven distribution of rain over the country each year, water resources available for utilization, including ground water, is claimed to be about 1122 billion cubic meters. Much of this water is unsafe, because pollution degrades water quality. Water pollution severely limits the amount of water available to Indian consumer, its industry and its agriculture.\\n\\nThe Ganges\\n\\nMillions depend on the polluted Ganges river.\\nMain article: Pollution of the Ganges\\n\\n    To know why 1,000 Indian children die of diarrhoeal sickness every day, take a wary stroll along the Ganges in Varanasi. As it enters the city, Hinduism’s sacred river contains 60,000 faecal coliform bacteria per 100 millilitres, 120 times more than is considered safe for bathing. Four miles downstream, with inputs from 24 gushing sewers and 60,000 pilgrim-bathers, the concentration is 3,000 times over the safety limit. In places, the Ganges becomes black and septic. Corpses, of semi-cremated adults or enshrouded babies, drift slowly by.\\n\\n    — The Economist on December 11, 2008[32]\\n\\nMore than 400 million people live along the Ganges River. An estimated 2,000,000 persons ritually bathe daily[citation needed] in the river, which is considered holy by Hindus. In the Hindu religion it is said to flow from the lotus feet of Vishnu (for Vaisnava devotees) or the hair of Shiva (for Saivites). The spiritual and religious significance could be compared to what the Nile river meant to the ancient Egyptians. While the Ganges may be considered holy, there are some problems associated with the ecology. It is filled with chemical wastes[citation needed], sewage and even the remains of human and animal corpses which carry major health risks by either direct bathing in the water, or by drinking (the Fecal-oral route).\\n\\nThe Yamuna\\n\\nThe Taj Mahal next to the polluted Yamuna river.\\nMain article: Yamuna\\n\\nNewsWeek describes Delhi's sacred Yamuna River as "a putrid ribbon of black sludge" where fecal bacteria is 10,000 over safety limits despite a 15-year program to address the problem.[33] Cholera epidemics are not unknown.[33] NewsWeek observes India's messy democracy is particularly ill equipped to handle the conflicting pressures of rapid growth and poverty. Even though India revised its national water policy in 2002 to encourage community participation and decentralize water management, the country's Byzantine bureaucracy ensures that it remains a "mere statement of intent." Responsibility for managing water issues is fragmented among a dozen different ministries and departments without any coordination. The government bureaucracy and state-run project department has failed to solve the problem, despite having spent many years and $500 million on this project.\\n[edit] Recent efforts to address water issues\\n\\nThe government of India envisions a US$100 billion project to interlink all major river networks in India.[34] This initiative would connect water-deficient areas to water-abundant ones by interlinking 37 Indian rivers.[35] One of the largest projects anywhere in the world, it would transfer water through 30 links across 9,600 kilometers. It would connect 32 dams and use 56 million tons of cement and 2 million tons of steel. The project aims a transformation of India's water treatment, management, transmission and distribution. The Indian government has proposed reforms to attract investment and privatization of its water networks. Water companies from all over the world have established a presence in India to pursue an estimated 70 projects worth several billion dollars in 20 Indian cities.[28] India is debating the social and environmental impact of this project. One of the first projects under consideration is the linking of Ken and Betwa rivers in northern India.\\n[edit] Air pollution\\nCooking fuel in rural India is prepared from a wet mix of dried grass, fuelwood pieces, hay, leaves and mostly cow/livestock dung. This mix is patted down into disc-shaped cakes, dried, and then used as fuel in stoves. When it burns, it produces smoke and numerous indoor air pollutants at concentrations 5 times higher than coal.\\nA rural stove using biomass cakes, fuelwood and trash as cooking fuel. Surveys suggest over 100 million households in India use such stoves (chullahs) every day, 2-3 times a day. Clean burning fuels and electricity are unavailable in rural parts and small towns of India because of poor rural highways and limited energy generation infrastructure.\\nAir pollution is high in Indian cities.\\nTraffic congestion on inadequate road infrastructure is a daily reality of India's urban centers. Slow speeds and idling vehicles produce, per trip, 4 to 8 times more pollutants and consume more carbon footprint fuels, than free flowing traffic. This 2008 image shows traffic congestion in Delhi.\\nSee also: Global warming in India\\n\\nFuel wood and biomass burning\\n\\nFuelwood and biomass burning is the primary reason for near-permanent haze and smoke observed above rural and urban India, and in satellite pictures of the country. Fuelwood and biomass cakes are used for cooking and general heating needs. These are burnt in cook stoves known as chullah or chulha in some parts of India. These cook stoves are present in over 100 million Indian households, and are used two to three times a day, daily. As of 2009, majority of Indians still use traditional fuels such as dried cow dung, agricultural wastes, and firewood as cooking fuel.[36] This form of fuel is inefficient source of energy, its burning releases high levels of smoke, PM10 particulate matter, NOX, SOX, PAHs, polyaromatics, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and other air pollutants.[5][37][38][39] Some reports, including one by the World Health Organization, claim 300,000 to 400,000 people die of indoor air pollution and carbon monoxide poisoning in India because of biomass burning and use of chullahs.[40] Burning of biomass and firewood will not stop, unless electricity or clean burning fuel and combustion technologies become reliably available and widely adopted in rural and urban India.\\n\\nIndia is the world's largest consumer of fuelwood, agricultural waste and biomass for energy purposes. From the most recent available nationwide study, India used 148.7 million tonnes coal replacement worth of fuelwood and biomass annually for domestic energy use. India's national average annual per capita consumption of fuel wood, agri wate and biomass cakes was 206 kilogram coal equivalent. In 2010 terms, with India's population increased to about 1.2 billion, the country burns over 200 million tonnes of coal replacement worth of fuel wood and biomass every year to meet its energy need for cooking and other domestic use. The study found that the households consumed around 95 million tonnes of fuelwood, one-third of which was logs and the rest was twigs. Twigs were mostly consumed in the villages, and logs were more popular in cities of India. The overall contribution of fuelwood, including sawdust and wood waste, was about 46% of the total, the rest being agri waste and biomass dung cakes. Traditional fuel (fuelwood, crop residue and dung cake) dominates domestic energy use in rural India and accounts for about 90% of the total. In urban areas, this traditional fuel constitutes about 24% of the total.[41]\\n\\nFuel wood, agri waste and biomass cake burning releases over 165 million tonnes of combustion products into India's indoor and outdoor air every year. To place this volume of emission in context, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the United States estimates that fire wood smoke contributes over 420,000 tonnes of fine particles throughout the United States – mostly during the winter months. United States consumes about one-tenth of fuelwood consumed by India, and mostly for fire place and home heating purposes. EPA estimates that residential wood combustion in the USA accounts for 44 percent of total organic matter emissions and 62 percent of the PAH, which are probable human carcinogens and are of great concern to EPA. The fuelwood sourced residential wood smoke makes up over 50 percent of the wintertime particle pollution problem in California.[42] In 2010, the state of California had about the same number of vehicles as all of India.\\n\\nIndia burns tenfold more fuelwood every year than the United States, the fuelwood quality in India is different than the dry firewood of the United States, and the Indian stoves in use are less efficient thereby producing more smoke and air pollutants per kilogram equivalent. India has less land area and less emission air space than the United States. In summary, the impact on indoor and outdoor air pollution by fuelwood and biomass cake burning is far worse in India.\\n\\nA United Nations study[43] finds firewood and biomass stoves can be made more efficient in India. Animal dung, now used in inefficient stoves, could be used to produce biogas, a cleaner fuel with higher utilization efficiency. In addition, an excellent fertilizer can be produced from the slurry from biogas plants. Switching to gaseous fuels would bring the greatest gains in terms of both thermal efficiency and reduction in air pollution, but would require more investment. A combination of technologies may be the best way forward.\\n\\nBetween 2001 and 2010, India has made progress in adding electrical power generation capacity, bringing electricity to rural areas, and reforming market to improve availability and distribution of liquified cleaner burning fuels in urban and rural area. Over the same period, scientific data collection and analysis show improvement in India's air quality, with some regions witnessing 30 to 65% reduction in NOx, SOx and suspended particulate matter. Even at these lower levels, the emissions are higher than those recommended by the World Health Organization. Continued progress is necessary.\\n\\nScientific studies conclude biomass combustion in India is the country's dominant source of carbonaceous aerosols, emitting 0.25 teragram per year of black carbon into air, 0.94 teragram per year of organic matter, and 2.04 teragram per year of small particulates with diameter less than 2.5 microns. Biomass burning, as domestic fuel in India, accounts for about 3 times as much black carbon air pollution as all other sources combined, including vehicles and industrial sources.[44]\\n\\nOther sources of pollution in Indian cities are vehicles and emissions from industry. Until 1992, India protected its automobile industry using license raj. Many two wheel, three wheel and four wheel vehicles lacked catalytic converters. Per vehicle emissions were amongst the highest in the world. The refining of oil and supply of fuel was owned, regulated and run by the government; the fuel quality was lax.\\n\\nIn 2005, India adopted emission standard of Bharat Stage IV for vehicles, which is equivalent to Euro IV European standards for vehicle emissions. Nevertheless, the old pre-2005 vehicles, and even pre-1992 vehicles are still on Indian streets.\\n\\nFuel adulteration\\n\\nSome Indian taxis and auto-rickshaws run on adulterated fuel blends. Adulteration of gasoline and diesel with lower-priced fuels is common in South Asia, including India.[45] Some adulterants increase emissions of harmful pollutants from vehicles, worsening urban air pollution. Financial incentives arising from differential taxes are generally the primary cause of fuel adulteration. In India and other developing countries, gasoline carries a much higher tax than diesel, which in turn is taxed more than kerosene meant as a cooking fuel, while some solvents and lubricants carry little or no tax. As fuel prices rise, the public transport driver cuts costs by blending the cheaper hydrocarbon into highly taxed hydrocarbon. The blending may be as much as 20-30 percent. For a low wage driver, the adulteration can yield short term savings that are significant over the month. The consequences to long term air pollution, quality of life and effect on health are simply ignored. Also ignored are the reduced life of vehicle engine and higher maintenance costs, particularly if the taxi, auto-rickshaw or truck is being rented for a daily fee.\\n\\nAdulterated fuel increases tailpipe emissions of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). Air toxin emissions — which fall into the category of unregulated emissions — of primary concern are benzene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), both well known carcinogens. Kerosene is more difficult to burn than gasoline; its addition results in higher levels of HC, CO and PM emissions even from catalyst-equipped cars. The higher sulfur level of kerosene is another issue. The permissible level of fuel sulfur in India, in 2002, was 0.25 percent by weight as against 0.10 percent for gasoline. The higher levels of sulfur can deactivate the catalyst. Once the catalyst becomes deactivated, the amount of pollution from the vehicle dramatically increases. Fuel adulteration is essentially an unintended consequence of tax policies and the attempt to control fuel prices, in the name of fairness. Air pollution is the ultimate result. This problem is not unique to India, but prevalent in many developing countries including those outside of south Asia. This problem is largely absent in economies that do not regulate the ability of fuel producers to innovate or price based on market demand.\\n\\nTraffic congestion\\n\\nTraffic congestion is severe in India's cities and towns. Traffic congestion is caused for several reasons, some of which are: increase in number of vehicles per kilometer of available road, a lack of intra-city divided-lane highways and intra-city expressways networks, lack of inter-city expressways, traffic accidents and chaos from poor enforcement of traffic laws.\\n\\nTraffic congestion reduces average traffic speed. At low speeds, scientific studies reveal, vehicles burn fuel inefficiently and pollute more per trip. For example, a study in the United States found that for the same trip, cars consumed more fuel and polluted more if the traffic was congested, than when traffic flowed freely. At average trip speeds between 20 to 40 kilometers per hour, the cars pollutant emission was twice as much as when the average speed was 55 to 75 kilometers per hour. At average trip speeds between 5 to 20 kilometers per hour, the cars pollutant emissions were 4 to 8 times as much as when the average speed was 55 to 70 kilometers per hour.[46] Fuel efficiencies similarly were much worse with traffic congestion.\\n\\nTraffic gridlock in Delhi and other India cities is extreme.[47] The average trip speed on many Indian city roads is less than 20 kilometers per hour; a 10 kilometer trip can take 30 minutes, or more. At such speeds, vehicles in India emit air pollutants 4 to 8 times more than they would with less traffic congestion; Indian vehicles also consume a lot more carbon footprint fuel per trip, than they would if the traffic congestion was less.\\n\\nIn cities like Bangalore, around 50% of children suffer from asthma.[48]\\n\\nRecent trends in India's air quality\\n\\nMonsoons scrub India's air, bringing its natural diversity in better view.\\nHimalayan peaks in eastern India on a day without haze.\\n\\nWith the last 15 years of economic development and regulatory reforms, India has made progress in improving its air quality. The table presents the average emissions sampled at many locations, over time, and data analyzed by scientific methods, by multiple agencies, including The World Bank. For context and comparison, the table also includes average values for Sweden in 2008, observed and analyzed by same methods. Over 1995-2008, average nationwide levels of major air pollutants have dropped by between 25-45 percent in India.\\nAir quality, trends over 1995-2008, averaged for India Air quality indicator[49] 	India 	India 	India 	Sweden\\n	1995 	2005 	2008 	2008\\nPollutant, PM10 (micrograms per cubic meter) 	109 	67 	59 	11\\nPollutant, CO2 emissions (kg per 2005 PPP$ of GDP) 	0.7 	0.6 	0.5 	0.2\\nHealth, mortality rate (under 5, per 1000) 	100 	73 	67 	3\\nPollutant, methane, Agriculture emissions (% total) 	68.8 	64.4 	n.a. 	28.1\\nPollutant, nitrous oxide, Agriculture emissions (% total) 	75.2 	73.4 	n.a. 	60.2\\n\\nIndia's Central Pollution Control Board now routinely monitors four air pollutants namely sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), suspended particulate matter (SPM) and respirable particulate matter (PM10). These are target air pollutants for regular monitoring at 308 operating stations in 115 cities/towns in 25 states and 4 Union Territories of India. The monitoring of meteorological parameters such as wind speed and direction, relative humidity and temperature has also been integrated with the monitoring of air quality. The monitoring of these pollutants is carried out for 24 hours (4-hourly sampling for gaseous pollutants and 8-hourly sampling for particulate matter) with a frequency of twice a week, to yield 104 observations in a year.\\n\\nFor 2010, the key findings of India's central pollution control board are:[50]\\n\\n    * Most Indian cities continue to violate India's and world air quality PM10 targets. Respirable particulate matter pollution remains a key challenge for India. Despite the general non-attainment, some cities showed far more improvement than others. A decreasing trend has been observed in PM10 levels in cities like Solapur and Ahmedabad over the last few years. This improvement may be due to local measures taken to reduce sulphur in diesel and stringent enforcement by Gujarat government.\\n    * A decreasing trend has been observed in sulphur dioxide levels in residential areas of many cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Bhopal during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced clean fuel standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood, and the use of LPG instead of diesel in certain vehicles.\\n    * A decreasing trend has been observed in nitrogen dioxide levels in residential areas of some cities such as Bhopal and Solapur during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced vehicle emission standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood.\\n    * Most Indian cities greatly exceed acceptable levels of suspended particulate matter. This may be because of refuse and biomass burning, vehicles, power plant emissions, industrial sources.\\n    * The Indian air quality monitoring stations reported lower levels of PM10 and suspended particulate matter during monsoon months possibly due to wet deposition and air scrubbing by rainfall. Higher levels of particulates were observed during winter months possibly due to lower mixing heights and more calm conditions. In other words, India's air quality worsens in winter months, and improves with the onset of monsoon season.\\n\\nFor its 2008 annual report, Central Pollution Control Board used 346 operating Air Quality Monitoring Stations, covering 130 cities / towns in 26 States and 4 Union Territories. With the weekly data collected and then averaged over the year, Central Pollution Control Board reported the following annual trends from 1998 to 2008:[24]\\n\\n    * The average annual SOx and NOx emissions level and periodic violations in industrial areas of India were significantly and surprisingly lower than the emission and violations in residential areas of India.\\n    * The 24-hour average PM10 and suspended particulate matter emissions and violations in almost all areas of India violated India's and WHO targets. The PM10 and suspended particulate matter concentrations, in industrial areas of India were, however, lower than those in residential areas of India. Residential areas of India were the source of over 90% of the most serious and repeated violations in particulate air pollution.\\n    * Of the four major Indian cities, air pollution was consistently worst in Delhi, every year over 5 year period (2004–2008). Kolkata was a close second, followed by Mumbai. Chennai air pollution was least of the four.\\n    * The states of Kerala and Meghalaya, relative to other Indian states, experienced on average some of lowest air pollution levels. The cities of Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam and Shillong, relative to other Indian cities and towns, experienced some of lowest air pollution levels.\\n    * Air Quality data collected from the monitoring station at Taj Mahal, Agra since year 1991 to 2008, suggests that both particulate and acid rain pollutants at Taj Mahal have been declining over the years. The 2008 average annual air pollutant concentrations were between 38 to 67% lower than those in 1991.\\n\\n[edit] Solid waste pollution\\nSolid waste adds to water pollution in India, a 2005 image.\\nTrash and garbage disposal services, responsibility of local government workers in India, are ineffective. Solid waste is routinely seen along India's streets and shopping plazas. Image shows solid waste pollution along a Jaipur street, a 2011 image.\\n\\nTrash and garbage is a common sight in urban and rural areas of India. It is a major source of pollution. Indian cities alone generate more than 100 million tons of solid waste a year. Street corners are piled with trash. Public places and sidewalks are despoiled with filth and litter, rivers and canals act as garbage dumps. In part, India's garbage crisis is from rising consumption. India's waste problem also points to a stunning failure of governance.[7]\\n\\nIn 2000, India's Supreme Court directed all Indian cities to implement a comprehensive waste-management program that would include household collection of segregated waste, recycling and composting. These directions have simply been ignored. No major city runs a comprehensive program of the kind envisioned by the Supreme Court. Indeed, forget waste segregation and recycling directive of the India's Supreme Court, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that up to 40 percent of municipal waste in India remains simply uncollected. Even medical waste, theoretically controlled by stringent rules that require hospitals to operate incinerators, is routinely dumped with regular municipal garbage. A recent study found that about half of India's medical waste is improperly disposed of.\\n\\nMunicipalities in Indian cities and towns have waste collection employees. However, these are unionized government workers and their work performance is neither measured nor monitored.\\n\\nSome of the few solid waste landfills India has, near its major cities, are overflowing and poorly managed. They have become significant sources of greenhouse emissions and breeding sites for disease vectors such as flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches, rats, and other pests.[51]\\n\\nIn 2011, several Indian cities embarked on waste-to-energy projects of the type in use in Germany, Switzerland and Japan.[52] For example, New Delhi is implementing two incinerator projects aimed at turning the city’s trash problem into electricity resource. These plants are being welcomed for addressing the city’s chronic problems of excess untreated waste and a shortage of electric power. They are also being welcomed by those who seek to prevent water pollution, hygiene problems, and eliminate rotting trash that produces potent greenhouse gas methane. The projects are being opposed by waste collection workers and local unions who fear changing technology may deprive them of their livelihood and way of life.[53]\\n\\nAlong with waste-to-energy projects, some cities and towns such as Pune, Maharashtra are introducing competition and the privatization of solid waste collection, street cleaning operations and bio-mining to dispose the waste. A scientific study suggests public private partnership is, in Indian context, more useful in solid waste management. According to this study, government and municipal corporations must encourage PPP-based local management through collection, transport and segregation and disposal of solid waste.[54]\\n[edit] Noise pollution\\n[icon] 	This section requires expansion.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court of India gave a significant verdict on noise pollution in 2005.[55] Unnecessary honking of vehicles makes for a high decibel level of noise in cities. The use of loudspeakers for political purposes and by temples and mosques make for noise pollution in residential areas because using more speakers in an programs the noise is increase.\\n\\nIn January 2010, Government of India published norms of permissible noise levels in urban and rural areas.[56]\\n[edit] Land pollution\\n\\nIn March 2009, the issue of Uranium poisoning in Punjab came into light, caused by fly ash ponds of thermal power stations, which reportedly lead to severe birth defects in children in the Faridkot and Bhatinda districts of Punjab.[57][58][59][60]\\n[edit] Environmental issues and Indian law\\n\\nSince about late 1980s, the Supreme Court of India has been pro-actively engaged in India's environmental issues. In most countries, it is the executive and the legislative branches of the government that plan, implement and address environmental issues; the Indian experience is different. The Supreme Court of India has been engaged in interpreting and introducing new changes in the environmental jurisprudence directly. The Court has laid down new principles to protect the environment, re-interpreted environmental laws, created new institutions and structures, and conferred additional powers on the existing ones through a series of directions and judgments. The Court’s directions on environmental issues goes beyond the general questions of law, as is usually expected from the highest Court of a democratic country. The Supreme Court of India, in its order, includes executive actions and technical details of environmental actions to be implemented. Indeed, some critics of India's Supreme Court describe the Court as the Lords of Green Bench or Garbage Supervisor. Supporters of India's Supreme Court term these orders and the Indian bench as pioneering, both in terms of laying down new principles of law, and in delivering environmental justice.[61]\\n\\nThe reasons for the increasing interjection of India's Supreme Court in governance arenas are, experts claim, complex. A key factor has been the failure of government agencies and the state owned enterprises in discharging their Constitutional and Statutory duties. This has prompted civil society groups to file public interest complaints with the Courts, particularly the Supreme Court, for suitable remedies.\\n\\nPublic interest litigation and judicial activism on environmental issues extends beyond India's Supreme Court. It includes the High Courts of individual states.\\n\\nIndia's judicial activism on environmental issues has, some suggest, delivered positive effects to the Indian experience. The Supreme Court has, through intense judicial activism, the proponents claim, become a symbol of hope for the people of India. As a result of judicial activism, India's Supreme Court has delivered a new normative regime of rights and insisted that the Indian state cannot act arbitrarily but must act reasonably and in public interest on pain of its action being invalidated by judicial intervention.[62]\\n\\nIndia's judicial activism on environmental issues has, others suggest, had adverse consequences. Public interest cases are repeatedly filed to block infrastructure projects aimed at solving environmental issues in India, such as but not limiting to water works, expressways, land acquisition for projects, and electricity power generation projects. The litigation routinely delays such projects, often for years, while rampant pollution continues in India, and tens of thousands die from the unintended effects of pollution. Even after a stay related to an infrastructure project is vacated, or a court order gives a green light to certain project, new issues become grounds for court notices and new public interest litigation.[63][64][65]\\n\\nJudicial activism in India has, in several key cases, found state-directed economic development ineffective and a failure, then interpreted laws and issued directives that encourage greater competition and free market to reduce environmental pollution. In other cases, the interpretations and directives have preserved industry protection, labor practices and highly polluting state-owned companies detrimental to environmental quality of India.[66]\\n[edit] Conservation\\nGreater adjutant perched on a pile of trash and solid waste in Assam.\\nThe world's rarest monkey, the golden langur.\\nForests of India's Western Ghats\\nForests of Kerala.

Eastern Himalayas are another of the 32 ecological hotspots of the world.\\nMain article: Wildlife in India\\n\\nEcological issues are an integral and important part of environmental issues challenging India. Poor air quality, water pollution and garbage pollution - all affect the food and environment quality necessary for ecosystems.\\n\\nIndia is a large and diverse country. Its land area includes regions with some of the world's highest rainfall to very dry deserts, coast line to alpine regions, river deltas to tropical islands. The variety and distribution of forest vegetation is large. India is one of the 12 mega biodiverse regions of the world.\\n\\nIndian forests types include tropical evergreens, tropical deciduous, swamps, mangroves, sub-tropical, montane, scrub, sub-alpine and alpine forests. These forests support a variety of ecosystems with diverse flora and fauna.\\n\\nUntil recently, India lacked an objective way to determine the quantity of forests it had, and the quality of forests it had.\\n\\nForest cover measurement methods\\n\\nPrior to 1980s, India deployed a bureaucratic method to estimate forest coverage. A land was notified as covered under Indian Forest Act, and then officials deemed this land area as recorded forest even if it was devoid of vegetation. By this forest-in-name-only method, the total amount of recorded forest, per official Indian records, was 71.8 million hectares. Any comparison of forest coverage number of a year before 1987 for India, to current forest coverage in India, is thus meaningless; it is just bureaucratic record keeping, with no relation to reality or meaningful comparison.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, space satellites were deployed for remote sensing of real forest cover. Standards were introduced to classify India's forests into the following categories:\\n\\n    * Forest Cover: defined as all lands, more than one hectare in area, with a tree canopy density of more than 10 percent. (Such lands may or may not be statutorily notified as forest area).\\n          o Very Dense Forest: All lands, with a forest cover with canopy density of 70 percent and above\\n          o Moderately Dense Forest: All lands, with a forest cover with canopy density of 40-70 percent\\n          o Open Forest: All lands, with forest cover with canopy density of 10 to 40 percent\\n          o Mangrove Cover: Mangrove forest is salt tolerant forest ecosystem found mainly in tropical and sub-tropical coastal and/or inter-tidal regions. Mangrove cover is the area covered under mangrove vegetation as interpreted digitally from remote sensing data. It is a part of forest cover and also classified into three classes viz. very dense, moderately dense and open.\\n          o Non Forest Land: defined as lands without any forest cover\\n    * Scrub Cover: All lands, generally in and around forest areas, having bushes and or poor tree growth, chiefly small or stunted trees with canopy density less than 10 percent\\n    * Tree Cover: Land with tree patches (blocks and linear) outside the recorded forest area exclusive of forest cover and less than the minimum mapable area of 1 hectare\\n    * Trees Outside Forests: Trees growing outside Recorded Forest Areas\\n\\nThe first satellite recorded forest coverage data for India became available in 1987. India and the United States cooperated in 2001, using Landsat MSS with spatial resolution of 80 meters, to get accurate Indian forest distribution data. India thereafter switched to digital image and advanced satellites with 23 meters resolution and software processing of images to get more refined data on forest quantity and forest quality. India now assesses its forest distribution data biennially. The 2007 forest census data thus obtained and published by the Government of India suggests the five states with largest area under forest cover as the following:[67]\\n\\n    * Madhya Pradesh: 7.64 million hectares\\n    * Arunachal Pradesh: 6.8 million hectares\\n    * Chhattisgarh: 5.6 million hectares\\n    * Orissa: 4.83 million hectares\\n    * Maharashtra: 4.68 million hectares\\n\\nIndia hosts significant biodiversity; it is home to 7.6% of all mammalian, 12.6% of avian, 6.2% of reptilian, and 6.0% of flowering plant species.[68]\\n\\nIn recent decades, human encroachment has posed a threat to India's wildlife; in response, a system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was substantially expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial habitat; further federal protections were promulgated in the 1980s. Along with over 500 wildlife sanctuaries, India now hosts 14 biosphere reserves, four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; 25 wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.\\n\\nThese laws did not have the effect they intended.\\n\\nIn 1985, India created the Ministry of Environment and Forests. This was followed by a National Forest Policy and the major government reforms of early 1990s.\\n\\nOver the last 20 years, India has reversed the deforestation trend. Specialists of the United Nations report India's forest as well as woodland cover has increased. A 2010 study by the Food and Agriculture Organization ranks India amongst the 10 countries with the largest forest area coverage in the world (the other nine being Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, United States of America, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Australia, Indonesia and Sudan).[12] India is also one the top 10 countries with the largest primary forest coverage in the world, according to this study.\\n\\nFrom 1990 to 2000, FAO finds India was the fifth largest gainer in forest coverage in the world; while from 2000 to 2010, FAO considers India as the third largest gainer in forest coverage.[12]\\n\\nNational Forest Commission and India's afforestation program\\n\\nIn 2003, India set up a National Forest Commission to review and assess India's policy and law, its effect on India's forests, its impact of local forest communities, and to make recommendations to achieve sustainable forest and ecological security in India.[69] The report made over 300 recommendations including the following:\\n\\n    * India must pursue rural development and animal husbandry policies to address local communities need to find affordable cattle fodder and grazing. To avoid destruction of local forest cover, fodder must reach these communities on reliable roads and other infrastructure, in all seasons year round.\\n    * The Forest Rights Bill is likely to be harmful to forest conservation and ecological security. The Forest Rights Bill became a law since 2007.\\n    * The government should work closely with mining companies. Revenue generated from lease of mines must be pooled into a dedicated fund to conserve and improve the quality of forests in the region where the mines are located.\\n    * Power to declare ecologically sensitive areas must be with each Indian state.\\n    * The mandate of State Forest Corporations and government owned monopolies must be changed.\\n    * Government should reform regulations and laws that ban felling of trees and transit of wood within India. Sustainable agro-forestry and farm forestry must be encouraged through financial and regulatory reforms, particularly on privately owned lands.\\n\\nIndia's national forest policy expects to invest US$ 26.7 billion by 2020, to pursue nationwide afforestation coupled with forest conservation, with the goal of increasing India's forest cover from 20% to 33%.[70]
I am a scientist at a university in the American Pacific Northwest studying structural and molecular parasitology.  I look for parasite genes that could be vulnerable to antiparasitic drugs and examine the structures of target parasite proteins for ways to make drugs more potent and less toxic to people.  My focus is to develop better treatments for Trypanosoma cruzi infection, the cause of Chagas disease, and related trypanosomatid Leishmania species.  Along with lab science, I have done advocacy and community building work on affordability of medicines to people living in poverty and development of new health technologies (drugs, diagnostics, vaccines) for neglected infections of poverty.
Authorities continue to ban or disperse most public demonstrations. Politicians and journalists critical of the government face violence and intimidation and are barred from equal access to the broadcast media. In addition, the judiciary remains weak and subject to political influence. Trafficking of women and children for sexual exploitation through networks protected or backed by police or government officials is rampant. The government continues to turn a blind eye to fraudulent confiscation of farmers’ land, illegal logging, and widespread plundering of natural resources.\\n\\nPolitician, particularly those speeching on abuse of power or corruption and democracy, were at risk of investigation by the police on charges of his political opinions.\\n\\n* In June, Batzandan Jalbasuren, the head of the Just Society Civic Movement was detained for 41 days in a pre-trial detention centre. He was sentenced to Capital punishment by a district court for organising the demonstrations against the Government. In addition, Enkhbayar Davaa, the coordinator of the Just Society Civic Movement, is wanted by the police because of the organising of demonstrations.
I never find it easy to write about myself, particularly when this is being posted to an open access website like Wikipedia and when I am using my real name! My main interest at the moment is related to financial organisations, monetary policy and potential impacts of financial institutions (in the broad sense) on financial stability. In particular I am currently at Cambridge University getting engaged with some of the literature on pricing and value theory, econometrics of financial markets, monetary theories of production, international capital markets and heterodox economic theory, having chosen to take a career break and participate in a Masters of Philosophy taught by the Center of Development Studies. Within this context, I have a particular interest in the advantages and disadvantages of the process of globalization of financial systems for both developed and developing countries. As you can probably appreciate, much of what I have learnt has direct application to some of the financial crises of recent years and my hope in participating in Wikipedia is to contribute a 'pluralist' voice in the context of an apparent failure of mainstream theory to prevent or explain recent events in the global economy.
'''Patrick Shanahan:  artist-photographer'''\\n\\nPatrick Shanahan (born Manchester, England, 1955) is a British artist-photographer whose photographs investigate the contemporary cultural landscape, offering a seductive and unsettling re-imaging of modern urban environments.\\n\\nMaking full use of the scenographic, artificial aspects of large-scale photography, he produces topographic images that are close to the kinds of minimalism found in painting and sculpture. These largely unpopulated compositions are subjected to a pristine finish and treatment of light, colour and space that help to establish a tension between a real and constructed landscape - a landscape in which the distinction between reality and imagination seem to blur and we are left with a peculiar sense of spatial estrangement.\\n\\nShanahan works with a variety of medium and large-format cameras and shoots on colour negative film. The film is digitally scanned and then worked on in Photoshop. Large-scale chromogenic dye-coupler prints are produced in limited editions - see artist website for details.\\n\\nThe result is hyperreal and illusory images that transform the environs we may be used to seeing into something disturbing and strange - images that pose the artificial and natural in opposition to one another. We feel simultaneously connected to and spatially estranged from them and, in blurring the distinction between reality and imagination, his photographs alter the way we see and relate to the world.
Who invented Gunpowder? \\n\\nDuring the Tang Dynasty, around 850 A.D, an enterprising alchemist (whose name has been lost to history) mixed 75 parts saltpeter with 15 parts charcoal and 10 parts sulfur. This mixture had no discernible life-lengthening properties, but it did explode with a flash and a bang when exposed to an open flame. According to a text from that era, "smoke and flames result, so that [the alchemists'] hands and faces have been burnt, and even the whole house where they were working burned down."\\n\\nMany western history books over the years have stated that the Chinese used this discovery only for fireworks, but that is not true. Song Dynasty military forces as early as 904 A.D. used gunpowder devices against their primary enemy, the Mongols. These weapons included "flying fire" (fei huo), an arrow with a burning tube of gunpowder attached to the shaft. Flying fire arrows were miniature rockets, which propelled themselves into enemy ranks and inspired terror among both men and horses. It must have seemed like fearsome magic to the first warriors who were confronted with the power of gunpowder.
'''International trade and water''' is the relationship between international trade and the water being used by humans. The substantial increase in human population during the 20th century combined with rapid increases in overall global economic development has resulted in rising challenges for the future of public water management.  The developing world has been particularly impacted by the lack of access to clean water. Each year, millions of people die due to illnesses, diseases, and lack the capital to create the infrastructure necessary to combat the problem.<ref>(Segerfeldt 2005)</ref> These conditions have increased the global demand for clean water and in turn, have pressured free market economists to suggest that wealthy market players are the most efficient solution to addressing water issues.<ref>(Saefong 2006)</ref> Several nations can benefit from international trade in water. Particularly nations with excess fresh water and abundant capital are looking forward to making healthy profits from either the export of water to other nations, or are interested in the investment returns they will earn from participation in foreign markets. However, not everyone agrees that market forces are best capable of solving water issues. NGOs, human rights organizations, and various stakeholders oppose viewing water in economic terms. These individuals accuse international trade agreements and international economic institutions including the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) of attempting to privatize a resource that they consider a basic human right.<ref>(Overbeke 2004)</ref>  The lack of a common understanding of whether or not water should be viewed as a commodity or a basic human right has resulted in heated debates among legal professionals and leading members of the academia.\\n\\n==Water as a commodity==\\nPrior to the industrial period, water had been extracted by whichever local community lived around it. As the industrial period progressed however, this view began to be replaced by a more economic oriented approach. Today, most water goes through a complicated industrial process that begins with its extraction and ends in a complicated process involving pipes, dams, and other sorts of unnatural facilities. Even fresh water that is located in rivers and lakes must somehow be extracted.  In general these considerations involve the use of land, labor and capital thereby replacing the notion of a common resource into a value based product. [[Desalination]] and desalination plants also play a major role.\\n\\n==International institutions, international trade agreements and [[water privatization]]==\\nIn 2000, out of the 40 IMF loans distributed 12 had requirements of partial or full privatization of water supplies.iv Likewise 50 percent of World Bank loans issued in 2002 to developing countries contained a clause that requested privatization of water services.<ref>(Public Citizen.org 2002)</ref> In addition to international institutions pushing for privatization, trade agreements in the 20th century have also created the legal framework for allowing the sale of water. The GATS, known as the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]], operates on a list in approach, meaning it allows privatization in areas that the nation has agreed to open to other members. The [[Doha Development Round]] of negotiations aims at changing this stature. During these negotiations it was declared that no sector is to be excluded from the negotiations to the new agreement. If water services negotiations succeed then once a member chooses to open their markets to their own private sector, then will have to afford other members the same rights to invest in that sector.<ref>(Mann 2006)</ref> Many regional trade agreements do not have a list in approach and are therefore subject to the same conditions mentioned above. For example, in the US-CAFTA agreement only Costa Rica directly specified that water services were to be excluded from foreign investment the other nations made no similar request.<ref>(Mann 2006)</ref>  Due to the mixed results obtained from privatization of water services and the difficulty of reversing that decision, several actors have strongly opposed the export of bulk fresh water. These actors claim that once such an action is allowed to occur then it will establish a precedent of treating water just like any other export. This in turn will become legally binding and irreversible.\\n\\n==International trade and water legal disputes and politics==\\nCanada is one of the largest owners of fresh water and has for years been engaged in a legal dispute over its possession of the resource. In 1990 an American company named Sunbelt was invited by the government of British Columbia to invest in a water exporting operation. Due to setbacks, the contract never matured and Sunbelt sued the government of British Columbia for failing to meet its obligations. After years of battle the Canadian government declared in 1999 that water in its fresh state as those found in rivers and lakes contains no economic value, and is therefore outside the obligations of its trade agreement.<ref>(Dr. Isabel Al-Assar 2008)</ref> In addition, the government cited article XI of GATT (G). This article allows for the conservation of a natural resource as long as the action taken by the government is done in a non-discriminatory manner. Sunbelt however, disagreed with the applicability of this clause and claimed that Canada’s actions are in direct violation of several international trade agreements. Particularly, Sunbelt addressed Article XI of GATT which forbids a member nation from imposing measures other than taxes, levies and other charges on the export of its good. Likewise, Sunbelt argued that the water located in British Columbia belonged to US companies just as much as it belongs to Canadian companies. This argument is based on Article 11 of NAFTA known as the investment chapter. Once water is extracted from its natural state for whatever reason that same right must be given to foreign investors. Sunbelt argues that Canadian companies had such extractions in the past and therefore opened the door for foreign investors to come in and do likewise.\\n\\n==Turkey-Israel==\\nIn 2002, Israel agreed to buy 1.75 billion cubic feet of water from Turkey every year for a period of 20 years.<ref>(US Water News Online 2004)</ref> The method of transport involved the use of [[Spragg Bag|large plastic bubbles]] that would bring the water to the storage facility. In regards to the talks, the foreign minister of Turkey declared that  this agreement will increase the cooperation between the two countries and also lead to peace and stability in the Middle East.<ref>(US Water News Online 2004)</ref> Economically Israel concluded that the cost of importing water would be higher than choosing the desalinization option but chose to import anyway. In addition to hoping to achieve peace the foreign minister  also mentioned that the landmark agreement turns water into an internationally accepted ''commodity,'' and that Turkey hopes to sell water to other countries. Turkey canceled the deal after the Gaza Flotilla Raid by IDF commandos  [[Gaza flotilla raid|Gaza Flotilla Raid]] on May 31 2010. During this incident several Turkish nationals were killed by Israeli armed forces.<ref>[http://www.uswaternews.com/archives/arcglobal/4israsign3.html Israel signs agreement to buy water from Turkey]</ref>\\n\\n==UN declaration==\\nIn July 2010, the [[UN General Assembly]] declared that [[human right to water and sanitation|access to clean water and sanitation]] is a human right.

{{User:Kpalion/Polish cuisine sidebox}}\\n\\nThe '''history of [[Polish cuisine]]''' has been shaped by such factors as the country's climate, a mostly agrarian lifestyle with parallel strains of rustic and luxurious culinary tradition, religious dietary requirements of the Catholic Church, external influences coming from various directions, as well as periods of scarcity and culinary monotony, notably during the Second World and Cold Wars. \\n\\nDue to Poland's location in a moderate temperate climate with frosty winters and a relatively short growing season, storage of food for several colder months, when fresh produce becomes largely unavailable, is a necessity. Before the advent of modern preservation techniques, such pasteurization and refrigeration, Poles relied on such traditional methods as salting-curing, pickling by lactic fermentation or acidification in vinegar, as well as smoking and drying. As a result, salty, sour and smoky flavors are typical of many Polish foods. Traditional Polish cooking is highly seasonal. ''Add examples of foods availably only during certain seasons.''\\n\\nThe official adoption of Western-rite Christianity in the 10th century CE meant that the natural seasonality has been compounded with the Roman Catholic liturgical calendar of alternating festive and fasting periods. Polish people still associate certain foods with specific religious holidays, such as Easter and Christmas. Many Poles fast every Friday, the day of the week associated with the crucifixion of Jesus, by refraining from eating land-animal meat and opting for fish instead.\\n\\nThroughout most of Poland's history, it was a predominantly agricultural country with a large portion of the population living off the fields and pastures which they tended themselves. An agrarian lifestyle with an emphasis on self-sufficience has played an important role in the shaping of Polish cuisine. Food production has always been supplemented with foraging and hunting in forests, enriching\\nthe Polish table with a variety of berries, mushrooms and game. An income gap, which grew in the early modern period between the peasants and petty nobility on the one hand and affluent grain-exporting magnates on the other, led to two separate strains in Polish culinary history – a simple rustic fare dominated by groats and flour-based foods, cabbage and root vegetables, as well as animal fats as a substitute for meat, versus lordly cuisine featuring choice meats, expensive sugar and exotic spices. The latter was played down under the Communist regime, but has been making a comeback in the 21st century and Polish cuisine draws from both currents today.\\n\\n* foreign influence: English, French, Italian, German, Czech, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Russian, Tatar, Jewish, Armenian, Turkish, etc.\\n* periods of scarcity: importance of culinary creativity\\n\\n{{TOC limit|3}}\\n\\n== Middle Ages ==\\n{{See also|Medieval cuisine|Regional cuisines of medieval Europe}}\\n[[File:Ur-painting.jpg|thumb|Copy of a 16th-century painting of an aurochs]]\\nInformation about Polish medieval cuisine is scant.

Subsistence farming was largely complemented with hunting, fishing, and foraging.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|pp=56–58}} \\n\\n[[Millet]] – originally [[foxtail millet]], but later replaced by [[proso millet]], better suited to the Polish climate – was the principal crop, typically consumed in the form of gruel or porridge and possibly flat breads.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|p=55}}{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=103–105}} Polish gardens provided various kinds of cabbage and [[kale]], legumes – such as [[flat bean]]s and [[lentil]]s – and root vegetables.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|p=55}}{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=125}} Peas and cabbage – fresh or pickled – were consumed all year round by all levels of the society.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=123–124}} Root vegetables included parsnips, [[Sium sisarum|skirrets]], carrots – then larger, whiter and more similar to the former – as well as beets, rutabagas, radishes, and turnips. The wife of [[Piast the Wheelwright]], a legendary peasant progenitor of Poland's first royal dynasty, was called [[Rzepicha|Rzepka]], or "Turnip", illustrating the vegetable's importance to early Poles of any station.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=126–129}} Some of the vegetables popularly consumed in this period – such as [[Fallopia convolvulus|black bindweed]],{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=11}} [[alexanders]], [[Chenopodium album|goosefoot]], [[Rumex scutatus|buckler sorrel]], and [[Lapsana|nipplewort]] – gradually disappeared from noble and then from peasant tables in later times. The [[Heracleum mantegazzianum|giant hogweed]], known in Polish as ''barszcz'', was used to make a soup to which it lent its name.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=126–129}} Additionally, apples, pears, plums, sweet and sour cherries, and hazelnuts were grown in the orchards.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=132}} \\n\\nAll social groups consumed fairly large amounts of meat, mostly pork. Pigs, resembling small wild boars, were grazed in oak and beech forests.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|p=56}} Cattle was raised mostly for draft and milk, so beef was a more expensive treat. Both of these kinds of meat, as well as poultry, were usually spit-roasted, but also stewed, boiled, barbecued or pickled in their own jelly.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=83–94}} The immense forests, which then covered most of the country, were a source of game, which served as an important addition to the meat of domestic animals. Poles commonly hunted the small game, such as hares, [[beaver]]s, [[badger]]s, [[Grey Partridge|partridges]], and [[black grouse]], and occasionally the big game, from [[roe deer]] to [[red deer]], elk ([[moose]]), wild boars, bears, [[European bison|wisent]], to [[aurochs]], the now-extinct ancestor of domestic cattle.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=84–85, 94–96}}\\n\\n* Seasonality, pickled vegetables, salted meat, ''rosół''\\n* [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church]].

Wyken Seagrave is passionate about using the history of the Universe to integrate a wide range of scientific, historical and social knowledge into a single unified story.\\n\\n“In a world facing many global problems, everyone can gain by understanding basic science, knowing where we came from and understanding the options facing us,” he says.\\n\\nWyken has been studying and writing about this subject for 40 years, both as an historical narrative and as fiction. His first book, Global Vision, was published in 1992 by Penny Press, a company dedicated to publishing on this subject, under the name Philip Brown. He converted the book to a website in 1998, and www.historyoftheuniverse.com now gets around 1 million visitors each year.\\n\\n“Seeing ourselves in a universal context is a salutary experience, giving us a new perspective on our current problems, many of which are on a global scale. To solve them will require global solutions. We all need to make important decisions about our ways of life. We need to understand what caused our problems and what options we have for solving them. We can only obtain this by taking a global perspective,” Wyken claims.\\n\\nHe began to write the story as a work of fiction in 2002, and published The Cosmic Monopole in 2011. This is the first volume of a sci-fi fantasy romance which will take the readers on a trip back through time to the Big Bang (and beyond) on an effort to save the Universe.

The goal of '''American influence operations in Russia''' is to force Russia into supporting American foreign policy interests and diminish Russia's potential to act as a geopolitical rival to the United States. The methods used include attempts to organise regime change in Russia, followed by installation of a new government that would be friendly towards the United States and support all its policies. Destroying Russia's capability to act as a geopolitical rival is the aim of the neoconservative agenda, according to which America should try to prevent to rise of future rivals "by all means necessary".\\n\\n== Support for NGOs and political parties ==\\nFunding of agenda-based NGOs and support for political parties.

The season for BBQ’s is just around the corner and as expected, there has been an increase in demand for outdoor electric grills. Long gone are the days where people use to burn coal to enjoy a good BBQ. Many researches showed that burning coal to cook BBQ food is known to be quite harmful as it emits carbon gases which get stored in the food that is being cooked; seeing as we consume that food, it is known to cause a lot of problems in the human body.

'''Mobile Adhoc Network: Routing Protocols \\nMANET'''\\n\\nAn ad hoc network is a collection of mobile nodes using wireless network interfaces to communicate among themselves without using the existing network infrastructure or centralized administration. In the areas where there is little or no infrastructure is available or the existing wireless infrastructure is expensive and inconvenient to use, Mobile Ad hoc Networks, called MANETs, are becoming useful. A mobile ad hoc network is a set of mobile nodes able to communicate with other nodes in their surroundings. These wireless communications happen in a peer-to-peer manner instead of static(fixed) network infrastructure, dynamically forming a temporary network to exchange information without using any pre-existing fixed network infrastructure. They are going to become integral part of next generation mobile services. A MANET consists of mobile platforms (e.g., a router with multiple hosts and wireless communications devices) herein simply referred to as "nodes", which are free to move about randomly. The nodes may be located in or on airplanes, ships, trucks, cars, perhaps even on very small devices, and there may be multiple hosts per router. The network topology in a MANET usually changes with time thus nodes are free to move arbitrarily.
== Motobolosm ==\\n\\nAn autoimmune disorder affecting African tribesmen. The total number of affected men is undetermined due to poor data gathering in the third world. It is theorized that the disease originates as a liver enzyme deficiency but and in turn results in the immune system attacking vital bodily systems such as the liver, pancreas, lungs/respiratory and some suspect it may also be responsible for heart failures. The disease only affects men in third world countries and seems to be only life threatening in those with the darkest of skins. The blackest of the blackies.
== Rape Trees ==\\n\\n\\n\\nOver the past several decades, crimes against women and children, crossing the U.S mexican border have risen.   It is estimated that the Border Patrol receives reports on about three to four rapes a day of illegal immigrants along the 2,000-mile border- or 1,040 to 1,460 a year” (TAASA; June 5, 2006) These women pay men, called "coyotes", to transport them into the United States with promises of jobs and security once they cross the border.  In an horrifying turn of events,the perpatrators are documenting their crimes by creating 'rape trees'.   ‘Rape trees’ are used as trophies,visual reminders that let other criminals know how many women were raped at the site. They hang their underwear on trees along the border as a symbol of power over the helpless immigrants.The practice first started along the border and now occurs in the Unided States.  California, Texas and Arizona,for example, are three states where ‘rape trees’ are appearing. Many of these victims remain unknown and are never given the life they were promised.\\n\\nTo view our blog, click on the link below:\\n\\n[http://www.PreventRapeTrees.Blogspot.com]
'''Aphthoviruses'''\\n\\nFoot-and-mouth disease (FMD), sometimes called hoof-and-mouth disease, is a highly contagious viral disease of cattle and pigs.  It can also infect deer, goats, sheep, and other animals with cloven hooves, as well as elephants, rats, and hedgehogs.  Horses are not susceptible to FMD.  The cause of FMD was first shown to be viral in 1897 by Friedrich Loeffler.  He passed the blood of an infected animal through a fine porcelain-glass filter and found that the fluid that was collected could still cause the disease in healthy animals.  FMD occurs throughout much of the world, including parts of Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America.  While currently (July 2001) some countries, including Canada, the United States, and Australia, have been relatively free of FMD for some time, its wide host range and rapid spread represent cause for international concern.\\n\\nIn cattle, foot-and-mouth disease is characterized by high fever that declines rapidly after two or three days; blisters inside the mouth that lead to excessive secretion of stringy or foamy saliva and to drooling; and blisters on the feet that may rupture and cause lameness.  Adult animals may suffer weight loss from which they do not recover for several months, and in cows, milk production can decline significantly.  Though most animals eventually recover from FMD, the disease can lead to ''myocarditis'' (inflammation of the heart muscle) and death, especially in newborn animals.  Some infected animals remain asymptomatic, that is, they do not suffer from or show signs of the disease; but they are ''carriers'' of FMD and can transmit it to others.\\n\\nInfection with foot-and-mouth disease tends to occur locally, that is, the virus is passed on to susceptible animals through direct contact with infected animals or with contaminated pens or vehicles used to transport livestock.  The clothes and skin of animal handlers such as farmers, standing water, and uncooked food scraps and feed supplements containing infected animal products can harbor the virus as well.  Cows can also catch FMD from the semen of infected bulls.  Control measures include quarantine and destruction of infected livestock, and export bans for meat and other animal products to countries not infected with the disease.\\n\\nFoot-and-mouth disease is caused by an ''Aphthovirus'' [ap-thoh"-vei'-r&s]  of the viral family ''Picornaviridae''. [pi-kawr'-n&-vir"-id-ei]  The members of this family are small (25-30 nm), nonenveloped icosahedral [ei-koh<nowiki>''</nowiki>-s&-hee'-dr&l]  viruses that contain single-stranded ''RNA'' (''ribonucleid acid'', the viral genetic material).  When such a virus comes in contact with a host cell, it binds to a receptor site and triggers a folding-in of the cell membrane.  Once the virus is inside the host cell, its protein coat dissolves.  New viral RNA and components of the protein coat are then synthesized in large quantities and assembled to form new viruses.  After assembly, the host cell ''lyses'' (bursts) and releases the new viruses.\\n\\nHumans can be infected with foot-and-mouth disease through contact with infected animals, but this is extremely rare.  Because the virus that causes FMD is sensitive to stomach acid, it cannot spread to humans via consumption of infected meat.  In the UK, the last confirmed human case occurred in 1967, and only a few other cases have been recorded in countries of continental Europe, Africa, and South America.  Symptoms of FMD in humans include malaise, fever, vomiting, red ulcerative lesions (surface-eroding damaged spots) of the oral tissues, and sometimes vesicular lesions (small blisters) of the skin.  There is another viral disease with similar symptoms, commonly referred to as “hand, foot, and mouth disease,” that occurs more frequently in humans, especially in young children; this disease is caused by a different virus of the family Picornaviridae, namely, an ''Enterovirus'' called ''Coxsackie A''.  Because FMD rarely infects humans but spreads rapidly among animals, it is a much greater threat to the agriculture industry than to human health.  Farmers around the world can lose billions of dollars a year during a foot-and-mouth epidemic, when large numbers of animals are destroyed and revenues from milk and meat production go down. \\n\\n=== For Further Reading ===\\nLevy, Jay A., Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat, and Robert A.

The Taiwan music and art scene has been flourishing in recent years. The influx of foreign artists to the country have given rise to a diverse culture of Taiwanese and non Taiwanese alike working together. This cohesion has made Taiwan a breeding ground for new, diverse, cutting edge, art and music. With the reach of the internet, art and music lovers from almost any country can now appreciate the talent emerging from this small Pacific Island nation.\\nTaiwan has it's share of political strife. And reflected in trials and tribulations of any society comes music, art and literature.\\n\\nMilitant Hippi, a musical band of artists that hail from different parts of the globe, has burst on the Taiwan culture scene. With them they have brought music, video art and political messages for the masses.\\n\\nThe Militant Hippi agenda is to keep the masses aware though music, art, humor and literature. Their music is a blended fusion of reggae, hip hop, classical, jazz and good ol' rock N roll.
Trait theory is a major approach to the study of human personality. Trait theorists are primarily interested in the measurement of traits, which can be defined as habitual patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion.[1] According to this perspective, traits are relatively stable over time, differ among individuals (e.g. some people are outgoing whereas others are shy), and influence behavior.\\n\\nGordon Allport was an early pioneer in the study of traits, which he sometimes referred to as dispositions. In his approach, central traits are basic to an individual's personality, whereas secondary traits are more peripheral. Common traits are those recognized within a culture and may vary between cultures. Cardinal traits are those by which an individual may be strongly recognized. Since Allport's time, trait theorists have focused more on group statistics than on single individuals. Allport called these two emphases "nomothetic" and "idiographic," respectively.\\n\\nThere is a nearly unlimited number of potential traits that could be used to describe personality. The statistical technique of factor analysis, however, has demonstrated that particular clusters of traits reliably correlate together. Hans Eysenck has suggested that personality is reducible to three major traits.[2] [3] Other researchers argue that more factors are needed to adequately describe human personality.[4] Many psychologists currently believe that five factors are sufficient.[5] [6]\\n\\nVirtually all trait models, and even ancient Greek philosophy, include extraversion vs. introversion as a central dimension of human personality. Another prominent trait that is found in nearly all models is Neuroticism, or emotional instability.
{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n"Sahel Calling" is a documentary film about the role of musicians in the humanitarian crisis in Mali and the Sahel. It is not just a film, but also a communication tool to raise awareness and encourage action to re-unite Mali, to stop the violation of human rights in the north of Mali, and to demand comprehensive relief aide for people affected by the rebel insurgences and the food and water shortage in the Sahel. Appealing to a global audience to stand in solidarity with these musicians and their messages, the film also emphasizes the urgent need for North and West Africans to come together to bring peace and unity in Mali and throughout the Sahel.\\n\\nSynopsis:\\nOften in Africa, musicians say what the politicans will not, and what the oppressed cannot. Whether international celebrities or local stars, the North and West African musicians of "Sahel Calling" tell us the story of strife and struggle in Mali and the Sahel. Of course, each musician has their own story, each rhythm its own history. The film honors this as it accompanies these musicians on a musical caravan through Mauritania, Mali and Burkina Faso.\\n\\nThe caravan is part of worldwide "Festival in Exile" which pays tribute to the Festival au Désert, a musical and cultural festival usually taking place in the north of Mali, now occupied by fundamentalist Islamic groups who ban the very creation and enjoyment of music. "Sahel Calling" questions the power of musicians in this time of humanitarian crisis, especially in light of the political, social, ethnic and religious complexities of Mali and the Sahel.
CYBER LAW & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\\nSuccess in any field of human activity leads to crime that needs mechanisms to control it.\\nLegal provisions should provide assurance to users, empowerment to law enforcement\\nagencies and deterrence to criminals. The law is as stringent as its enforcement. Crime is no\\nlonger limited to space, time or a group of people. Cyber space creates moral, civil and\\ncriminal wrongs. It has now given a new way to express criminal tendencies. Back in 1990,\\nless than 100,000 people were able to log on to the Internet worldwide. Now around 500\\nmillion people are hooked up to surf the net around the globe.\\nUntil recently, many information technology (IT) professionals lacked awareness of and\\ninterest in the cyber crime phenomenon. In many cases, law enforcement officers have\\nlacked the tools needed to tackle the problem; old laws didn’t quite fit the crimes being\\ncommitted, new laws hadn’t quite caught up to the reality of what was happening, and there\\nwere few court precedents to look to for guidance. Furthermore, debates over privacy issues\\nhampered the ability of enforcement agents to gather the evidence needed to prosecute these\\nnew cases. Finally, there was a certain amount of antipathy—or at the least, distrust—\\nbetween the two most important players in any effective fight against cyber crime: law\\nenforcement agencies and computer professionals. Yet close cooperation between the two\\nis crucial if we are to control the cyber crime problem and make the Internet a safe “place”\\nfor its users.\\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law|Law]] enforcement personnel understand the criminal mindset and know the basics of\\ngathering evidence and bringing offenders to justice. IT personnel understand computers\\nand networks, how they work, and how to track down information on them. Each has half of\\nthe key to defeating the cyber criminal.\\nIT professionals need good definitions of cybercrime in order to know when (and what) to\\nreport to police, but law enforcement agencies must have statutory definitions of specific\\ncrimes in order to charge a criminal with an offense. The first step in specifically defining\\nindividual cybercrimes is to sort all the acts that can be considered cybercrimes into\\norganized categories.United Nations’ Definition of Cybercrime\\nCybercrime spans not only state but national boundaries as well. Perhaps we should look to\\ninternational organizations to provide a standard definition of the crime. At the Tenth\\nUnited Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of Offenders, in a\\nworkshop devoted to the issues of crimes related to computer networks, cybercrime was\\nbroken into two categories and defined thus:\\na. Cybercrime in a narrow sense (computer crime): Any illegal behavior directed by means\\nof electronic operations that targets the security of computer systems and the data processed\\nby them.\\nb. Cybercrime in a broader sense (computer-related crime): Any illegal behavior committed\\nby means of, or in relation to, a computer system or network, including such crimes as\\nillegal possession [and] offering or distributing information by means of a computer system\\nor network.\\nOf course, these definitions are complicated by the fact that an act may be illegal in one\\nnation but not in another.\\nThere are more concrete examples, including\\ni. Unauthorized access\\nii Damage to computer data or programs\\niii Computer sabotage\\niv Unauthorized interception of communications\\nv Computer espionage\\nThese definitions, although not completely definitive, do give us a good starting point—one\\nthat has some international recognition and agreement—for determining just what we mean\\nby the term cybercrime.\\nIn Indian law, cyber crime has to be voluntary and willful, an act or omission that adversely\\naffects a person or property. The IT Act provides the backbone for e-commerce and India’s\\napproach has been to look at e-governance and e-commerce primarily from the promotional\\naspects looking at the vast opportunities and the need to sensitize the population to the\\n2possibilities of the information age. There is the need to take in to consideration the security\\naspects.\\nIn the present global situation where cyber control mechanisms are important we need to\\npush cyber laws. Cyber Crimes are a new class of crimes to India rapidly expanding due to\\nextensive use of internet. Getting the right lead and making the right interpretation are very\\nimportant in solving a cyber crime. The 7 stage continuum of a criminal case starts from\\nperpetration to registration to reporting, investigation, prosecution, adjudication and\\nexecution. The system can not be stronger than the weakest link in the chain. In India, there\\nare 30 million policemen to train apart from 12,000 strong Judiciary. Police in India are\\ntrying to become cyber crime savvy and hiring people who are trained in the area. Each\\npolice station in Delhi will have a computer soon which will be connected to the Head\\nQuarter.. The pace of the investigations however can be faster; judicial sensitivity and\\nknowledge need to improve. Focus needs to be on educating the police and district\\njudiciary. IT Institutions can also play a role in this area.\\nTechnology nuances are important in a spam infested environment where privacy can be\\ncompromised and individuals can be subjected to become a victim unsuspectingly. We need\\nto sensitize our investigators and judges to the nuances of the system. Most cyber criminals\\nhave a counter part in the real world. If loss of property or persons is caused the criminal is\\npunishable under the IPC also. Since the law enforcement agencies find it is easier to handle\\nit under the IPC, IT Act cases are not getting reported and when reported are not necessarily\\ndealt with under the IT Act. A lengthy and intensive process of learning is required.\\nA whole series of initiatives of cyber forensics were undertaken and cyber law procedures\\nresulted out of it. This is an area where learning takes place every day as we are all\\nbeginners in this area. We are looking for solutions faster than the problems can get\\ninvented. We need to move faster than the criminals.\\nThe real issue is how to prevent cyber crime. For this, there is need to raise the probability\\nof apprehension and conviction. India has a law on evidence that considers admissibility,\\nauthenticity, accuracy, and completeness to convince the judiciary. The challenge in cyber\\ncrime cases includes getting evidence that will stand scrutiny in a foreign court.\\n3For this India needs total international cooperation with specialised agencies of different\\ncountries. Police has to ensure that they have seized exactly what was there at the scene of\\ncrime, is the same that has been analysed and the report presented in court is based on this\\nevidence. It has to maintain the chain of custody. The threat is not from the intelligence of\\ncriminals but from our ignorance and the will to fight it. The law is stricter now on\\nproducing evidence especially where electronic documents are concerned.\\nThe computer is the target and the tool for the perpetration of crime. It is used for the\\ncommunication of the criminal activity such as the injection of a virus/worm which can\\ncrash entire networks. \\nThe [[Information_Technology_Act,_2000|Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000]], specifies the acts which have been made\\npunishable. Since the primary objective of this Act is to create an enabling environment for\\ncommercial use of I.T., certain omissions and commissions of criminals while using\\ncomputers have not been included. With the legal recognition of Electronic Records and the\\namendments made in the several sections of the IPC vide the IT Act, 2000, several offences\\nhaving bearing on cyber-arena are also registered under the appropriate sections of the IPC.\\nDuring the year 2003, 60 cases were registered under IT Act as compared to 70 cases during\\nthe previous year thereby reporting a decline of 14.3 percent in 2003 over 2002. Of the total\\n60 cases registered under IT Act 2000, around 33 percent (20 cases) relate to Obscene\\nPublication / Transmission in electronic form, normally known as cases of cyber\\npornography. 17 persons were arrested for committing such offences during 2003.\\nThere were 21 cases of Hacking of computer systems wherein 18 persons were arrested in\\n2003. Of the total (21) Hacking cases, the cases relating to Loss/Damage of computer\\nresource/utility under Sec 66(1) of the IT Act were to the tune of 62 percent (13 cases) and\\nthat related to Hacking under Section 66(2) of IT Act were 38 percent (8cases). \\nDuring 2003, a total of 411 cases were registered under IPC Sections as compared to 738\\nsuch cases during 2002 thereby reporting a significant decline of 44 percent in 2003 over\\n2002. Andhra Pradesh reported more than half of such cases (218 out of 411) (53 percent). \\n4Of the 411 cases registered under IPC, majority of the crimes fall under 3 categories viz.\\nCriminal Breach of Trust or Fraud (269), Forgery (89) and [[Counterfeiting]] (53). \\nThough, these offences fall under the traditional IPC crimes, the cases had the cyber tones\\nwherein computer, Internet or its related aspects were present in the crime and hence they\\nwere categorised as Cyber Crimes under IPC. \\nDuring 2003, number of cases under Cyber Crimes relating to Counterfeiting of\\ncurrency/Stamps stood at 53 wherein 118 persons were arrested during 2003. Of the 47,478\\ncases reported under Cheating, the Cyber Forgery (89) accounted for 0.2 per cent. Of the\\ntotal Criminal Breach of Trust cases (13,432), the Cyber frauds (269) accounted for 2\\npercent. Of the Counterfeiting offences (2,055), Cyber Counterfeiting (53) offences\\naccounted for 2.6 percent.\\nA total of 475 persons were arrested in the country for Cyber Crimes under IPC during\\n2003. Of these, 53.6 percent offenders (255) were taken into custody for offences under\\nCriminal Breach of Trust/Fraud (Cyber) and 21.4 percent (102) for offences under ‘Cyber\\nForgery’.\\nThe age-wise profile of the arrested persons showed that 45 percent were in the age-group\\nof 30-45 years, 28.5 percent of the offenders were in the age-group of 45-60 years and 11\\noffenders were aged 60 years and above. Gujarat reported 2 offenders who were below 18\\nyears of age. \\nFraud/Illegal gain (120) accounted for 60 per cent of the total Cyber Crime motives reported\\nin the country. Greed/Money (15 cases) accounted for 7.5 percent of the Cyber Crimes\\nreported. Eve-teasing and Harassment (8 cases) accounted for around 4 per cent. Cyber\\nSuspects include Neighbours / Friends / Relatives (91), Disgrunted employees (11),\\nBusiness Competitors (9), Crackers Students / Professional learners (3). \\nCybercrime is not on the decline. The latest statistics show that cybercrime is actually on the\\nrise. However, it is true that in India, cybercrime is not reported too much about.\\nConsequently there is a false sense of complacency that cybercrime does not exist and that\\n5society is safe from cybercrime. This is not the correct picture. The fact is that people in our\\ncountry do not report cybercrimes for many reasons. Many do not want to face harassment\\nby the police. There is also the fear of bad publicity in the media, which could hurt their\\nreputation and standing in society. Also, it becomes extremely difficult to convince the\\npolice to register any cybercrime, because of lack of orientation and awareness about\\ncybercrimes and their registration and handling by the police. \\nA recent survey indicates that for every 500 cybercrime incidents that take place, only 50\\nare reported to the police and out of that only one is actually registered. These figures\\nindicate how difficult it is to convince the police to register a cybercrime. The establishment\\nof cybercrime cells in different parts of the country was expected to boost cybercrime\\nreporting and prosecution. However, these cells haven’t quite kept up with expectations.\\nNetizens should not be under the impression that cybercrime is vanishing and they must\\nrealize that with each passing day, cyberspace becomes a more dangerous place to be in,\\nwhere criminals roam freely to execute their criminals intentions encouraged by the socalled anonymity that internet provides.\\nThe absolutely poor rate of cyber crime conviction in the country has also not helped the\\ncause of regulating cybercrime. There has only been few cybercrime convictions in the\\nwhole country, which can be counted on fingers. We need to ensure that we have\\nspecialized procedures for prosecution of cybercrime cases so as to tackle them on a priority\\nbasis,. This is necessary so as to win the faith of the people in the ability of the system to\\ntackle cybercrime. We must ensure that our system provides for stringent punishment of\\ncybercrimes and cyber criminals so that the same acts as a deterrent for others. \\nThreat Perceptions\\nUK has the largest number of infected computers in the world followed by the US and\\nChina. Financial attacks are 16 events per 1000, the highest among all kinds of attacks. The\\nUS is the leading source country for attacks but this has declined. China is second and\\nGermany is third. It is hard to determine where the attack came from originally.\\nThe number of viruses and worm variants rose sharply to 7,360 that is a 64% increase over\\nthe previous reporting period and a 332% increase over the previous year. There are 17,500\\nvariants of Win.32 viruses. Threats to confidential information are on the rise with 54% of\\n6the top 50 reporting malicious code with the potential to expose such information. Phishing\\nmessages grew to 4.5 million from 1 million between July and December 2004.\\nSome Indian Case Studies\\n1. Pune Citibank MphasiS Call Center Fraud\\nUS $ 3,50,000 from accounts of four US customers were dishonestly transferred to bogus\\naccounts. This will give a lot of ammunition to those lobbying against outsourcing in US.\\nSuch cases happen all over the world but when it happens in India it is a serious matter and\\nwe can not ignore it. It is a case of sourcing engineering. Some employees gained the\\nconfidence of the customer and obtained their PIN numbers to commit fraud. They got these\\nunder the guise of helping the customers out of difficult situations. Highest security prevails\\nin the call centers in India as they know that they will lose their business. There was not as\\nmuch of breach of security but of sourcing engineering.\\nThe call center employees are checked when they go in and out so they can not copy down\\nnumbers and therefore they could not have noted these down. They must have remembered\\nthese numbers, gone out immediately to a cyber café and accessed the Citibank accounts of\\nthe customers.\\nAll accounts were opened in Pune and the customers complained that the money from their\\naccounts was transferred to Pune accounts and that’s how the criminals were traced. Police\\nhas been able to prove the honesty of the call center and has frozen the accounts where the\\nmoney was transferred.\\nThere is need for a strict background check of the call center executives. However, best of\\nbackground checks can not eliminate the bad elements from coming in and breaching\\nsecurity. We must still ensure such checks when a person is hired. There is need for a\\nnational ID and a national data base where a name can be referred to. In this case\\npreliminary investigations do not reveal that the criminals had any crime history. Customer\\neducation is very important so customers do not get taken for a ride. Most banks are guilt of\\nnot doing this. \\n2. Bazee.com case\\n7CEO of Bazee.com was arrested in December 2004 because a CD with objectionable\\nmaterial was being sold on the website. The CD was also being sold in the markets in Delhi.\\nThe Mumbai city police and the Delhi Police got into action. The CEO was later released on\\nbail. This opened up the question as to what kind of distinction do we draw between Internet\\nService Provider and Content Provider. The burden rests on the accused that he was the\\nService Provider and not the Content Provider. It also raises a lot of issues regarding how\\nthe police should handle the cyber crime cases and a lot of education is required.\\n3. State of Tamil Nadu Vs Suhas Katti \\nThe Case of Suhas Katti is notable for the fact that the conviction was achieved successfully\\nwithin a relatively quick time of 7 months from the filing of the FIR. Considering that\\nsimilar cases have been pending in other states for a much longer time, the efficient\\nhandling of the case which happened to be the first case of the Chennai Cyber Crime Cell\\ngoing to trial deserves a special mention.\\nThe case related to posting of obscene, defamatory and annoying message about a divorcee\\nwoman in the yahoo message group. E-Mails were also forwarded to the victim for\\ninformation by the accused through a false e-mail account opened by him in the name of the\\nvictim. The posting of the message resulted in annoying phone calls to the lady in the belief\\nthat she was soliciting.\\nBased on a complaint made by the victim in February 2004, the Police traced the accused to\\nMumbai and arrested him within the next few days. The accused was a known family friend\\nof the victim and was reportedly interested in marrying her. She however married another\\nperson. This marriage later ended in divorce and the accused started contacting her once\\nagain. On her reluctance to marry him, the accused took up the harassment through the\\nInternet. \\nOn 24-3-2004 Charge Sheet was filed u/s 67 of IT Act 2000, 469 and 509 IPC before The\\nHon’ble Addl. CMM Egmore by citing 18 witnesses and 34 documents and material objects.\\nThe same was taken on file in C.C.NO.4680/2004. On the prosecution side 12 witnesses\\nwere examined and entire documents were marked as Exhibits.\\n8The Defence argued that the offending mails would have been given either by ex-husband\\nof the complainant or the complainant her self to implicate the accused as accused alleged to\\nhave turned down the request of the complainant to marry her. \\nFurther the Defence counsel argued that some of the documentary evidence was not\\nsustainable under Section 65 B of the Indian Evidence Act. However, the court relied upon\\nthe expert witnesses and other evidence produced before it, including the witnesses of the\\nCyber Cafe owners and came to the conclusion that the crime was conclusively proved.\\nLd. Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, delivered the judgement on 5-11-04\\nas follows:\\n“ The accused is found guilty of offences under section 469, 509 IPC and 67 of IT Act\\n2000 and the accused is convicted and is sentenced for the offence to undergo RI for 2\\nyears under 469 IPC and to pay fine of Rs.500/-and for the offence u/s 509 IPC\\nsentenced to undergo 1 year Simple imprisonment and to pay fine of Rs.500/- and for\\nthe offence u/s 67 of IT Act 2000 to undergo RI for 2 years and to pay fine of\\nRs.4000/- All sentences to run concurrently.”\\nThe accused paid fine amount and he was lodged at Central Prison, Chennai. This is\\nconsidered as the first case convicted under section 67 of Information Technology Act 2000\\nin India. \\n4. The Bank NSP Case\\nThe Bank NSP case is the one where a management trainee of the bank was engaged to be\\nmarried. The couple exchanged many emails using the company computers. After some\\ntime the two broke up and the girl created fraudulent email ids such as\\n“indianbarassociations” and sent emails to the boy’s foreign clients. She used the banks\\ncomputer to do this. The boy’s company lost a large number of clients and took the bank to\\ncourt. The bank was held liable for the emails sent using the bank’s system.\\n5. SMC Pneumatics (India) Pvt. Ltd. v. Jogesh Kwatra\\n9In India’s first case of cyber defamation, a Court of Delhi assumed jurisdiction over a matter\\nwhere a corporate’s reputation was being defamed through emails and passed an important\\nex-parte injunction. \\nIn this case, the defendant Jogesh Kwatra being an employ of the plaintiff company started\\nsending derogatory, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, filthy and abusive emails to his employers\\nas also to different subsidiaries of the said company all over the world with the aim to\\ndefame the company and its Managing Director Mr. R K Malhotra. The plaintiff filed a suit\\nfor permanent injunction restraining the defendant from doing his illegal acts of sending\\nderogatory emails to the plaintiff.\\nOn behalf of the plaintiffs it was contended that the emails sent by the defendant were\\ndistinctly obscene, vulgar, abusive, intimidating, humiliating and defamatory in nature.\\nCounsel further argued that the aim of sending the said emails was to malign the high\\nreputation of the plaintiffs all over India and the world. He further contended that the acts of\\nthe defendant in sending the emails had resulted in invasion of legal rights of the plaintiffs.\\nFurther the defendant is under a duty not to send the aforesaid emails. It is pertinent to note\\nthat after the plaintiff company discovered the said employ could be indulging in the matter\\nof sending abusive emails, the plaintiff terminated the services of the defendant. \\nAfter hearing detailed arguments of Counsel for Plaintiff, Hon’ble Judge of the Delhi High\\nCourt passed an ex-parte ad interim injunction observing that a prima facie case had been\\nmade out by the plaintiff. Consequently, the Delhi High Court restrained the defendant from\\nsending derogatory, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, humiliating and abusive emails either to\\nthe plaintiffs or to its sister subsidiaries all over the world including their Managing\\nDirectors and their Sales and Marketing departments. Further, Hon’ble Judge also restrained\\nthe defendant from publishing, transmitting or causing to be published any information in\\nthe actual world as also in cyberspace which is derogatory or defamatory or abusive of the\\nplaintiffs.\\n10This order of Delhi High Court assumes tremendous significance as this is for the first time\\nthat an Indian Court assumes jurisdiction in a matter concerning cyber defamation and\\ngrants an ex-parte injunction restraining the defendant from defaming the plaintiffs by\\nsending derogatory, defamatory, abusive and obscene emails either to the plaintiffs or their\\nsubsidiaries.\\n6. PARLIAMENT ATTACK CASE\\nBureau of Police Research and Development at Hyderabad had handled some of the top\\ncyber cases, including analysing and retrieving information from the laptop recovered from\\nterrorist, who attacked Parliament. The laptop which was seized from the two terrorists,\\nwho were gunned down when Parliament was under siege on December 13 2001, was sent\\nto Computer Forensics Division of BPRD after computer experts at Delhi failed to trace\\nmuch out of its contents. \\nThe laptop contained several evidences that confirmed of the two terrorists’ motives,\\nnamely the sticker of the Ministry of Home that they had made on the laptop and pasted on\\ntheir ambassador car to gain entry into Parliament House and the the fake ID card that one\\nof the two terrorists was carrying with a Government of India emblem and seal.\\nThe emblems (of the three lions) were carefully scanned and the seal was also craftly made\\nalong with residential address of Jammu and Kashmir. But careful detection proved that it\\nwas all forged and made on the laptop.\\n7. Andhra Pradesh Tax Case\\nDubious tactics of a prominent businessman from Andhra Pradesh was exposed after\\nofficials of the department got hold of computers used by the accused person.\\nThe owner of a plastics firm was arrested and Rs 22 crore cash was recovered from his\\nhouse by sleuths of the Vigilance Department. They sought an explanation from him\\nregarding the unaccounted cash within 10 days.\\n11The accused person submitted 6,000 vouchers to prove the legitimacy of trade and thought\\nhis offence would go undetected but after careful scrutiny of vouchers and contents of his\\ncomputers it revealed that all of them were made after the raids were conducted. \\nIt later revealed that the accused was running five businesses under the guise of one\\ncompany and used fake and computerised vouchers to show sales records and save tax.\\n8. SONY.SAMBANDH.COM CASE\\nIndia saw its first cybercrime conviction recently. It all began after a complaint was filed by\\nSony India Private Ltd, which runs a website called www.sony-sambandh.com, targeting\\nNon Resident Indians. The website enables NRIs to send Sony products to their friends and\\nrelatives in India after they pay for it online. \\nThe company undertakes to deliver the products to the concerned recipients. In May 2002,\\nsomeone logged onto the website under the identity of Barbara Campa and ordered a Sony\\nColour Television set and a cordless head phone. \\nShe gave her credit card number for payment and requested that the products be delivered to\\nArif Azim in Noida. The payment was duly cleared by the credit card agency and the\\ntransaction processed. After following the relevant procedures of due diligence and\\nchecking, the company delivered the items to Arif Azim. \\nAt the time of delivery, the company took digital photographs showing the delivery being\\naccepted by Arif Azim.\\nThe transaction closed at that, but after one and a half months the credit card agency\\ninformed the company that this was an unauthorized transaction as the real owner had\\ndenied having made the purchase. \\nThe company lodged a complaint for online cheating at the Central Bureau of Investigation\\nwhich registered a case under Section 418, 419 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code. \\nThe matter was investigated into and Arif Azim was arrested. Investigations revealed that\\nArif Azim, while working at a call centre in Noida gained access to the credit card number\\nof an American national which he misused on the company’s site. \\n12The CBI recovered the colour television and the cordless head phone.\\nIn this matter, the CBI had evidence to prove their case and so the accused admitted his\\nguilt. The court convicted Arif Azim under Section 418, 419 and 420 of the Indian Penal\\nCode — this being the first time that a cybercrime has been convicted. \\nThe court, however, felt that as the accused was a young boy of 24 years and a first-time\\nconvict, a lenient view needed to be taken. The court therefore released the accused on\\nprobation for one year.\\nThe judgment is of immense significance for the entire nation. Besides being the first\\nconviction in a cybercrime matter, it has shown that the the Indian Penal Code can be\\neffectively applied to certain categories of cyber crimes which are not covered under the\\nInformation Technology Act 2000. Secondly, a judgment of this sort sends out a clear\\nmessage to all that the law cannot be taken for a ride. \\n9. Nasscom vs. Ajay Sood & Others\\nIn a landmark judgment in the case of National Association of Software and Service\\nCompanies vs Ajay Sood & Others, delivered in March, ‘05, the Delhi High Court declared\\n`[[phishing]]’ on the internet to be an illegal act, entailing an injunction and recovery of\\ndamages.\\nElaborating on the concept of ‘phishing’, in order to lay down a precedent in India, the court\\nstated that it is a form of internet fraud where a person pretends to be a legitimate\\nassociation, such as a bank or an insurance company in order to extract personal data from a\\ncustomer such as access codes, passwords, etc. Personal data so collected by\\nmisrepresenting the identity of the legitimate party is commonly used for the collecting\\nparty’s advantage. court also stated, by way of an example, that typical phishing scams\\ninvolve persons who pretend to represent online banks and siphon cash from e-banking\\naccounts after conning consumers into handing over confidential banking details.\\nThe Delhi HC stated that even though there is no specific legislation in India to penalise\\nphishing, it held phishing to be an illegal act by defining it under Indian law as “a\\n13misrepresentation made in the course of trade leading to confusion as to the source and\\norigin of the e-mail causing immense harm not only to the consumer but even to the person\\nwhose name, identity or password is misused.” The court held the act of phishing as passing\\noff and tarnishing the plaintiff’s image.\\nThe plaintiff in this case was the National Association of Software and Service Companies\\n(Nasscom), India’s premier software association. \\nThe defendants were operating a placement agency involved in head-hunting and\\nrecruitment. In order to obtain personal data, which they could use for purposes of headhunting, the defendants composed and sent e-mails to third parties in the name of Nasscom.\\nThe high court recognised the trademark rights of the plaintiff and passed an ex-parte adinterim injunction restraining the defendants from using the trade name or any other name\\ndeceptively similar to Nasscom. The court further restrained the defendants from holding\\nthemselves out as being associates or a part of Nasscom.\\nThe court appointed a commission to conduct a search at the defendants’ premises. Two\\nhard disks of the computers from which the fraudulent e-mails were sent by the defendants\\nto various parties were taken into custody by the local commissioner appointed by the court.\\nThe offending e-mails were then downloaded from the hard disks and presented as evidence\\nin court. \\nDuring the progress of the case, it became clear that the defendants in whose names the\\noffending e-mails were sent were fictitious identities created by an employee on defendants’\\ninstructions, to avoid recognition and legal action. On discovery of this fraudulent act, the\\nfictitious names were deleted from the array of parties as defendants in the case.\\nSubsequently, the defendants admitted their illegal acts and the parties settled the matter\\nthrough the recording of a compromise in the suit proceedings. According to the terms of\\ncompromise, the defendants agreed to pay a sum of Rs1.6 million to the plaintiff as\\ndamages for violation of the plaintiff’s trademark rights. The court also ordered the hard\\ndisks seized from the defendants’ premises to be handed over to the plaintiff who would be\\nthe owner of the hard disks. \\n14This case achieves clear milestones: It brings the act of “phishing” into the ambit of Indian\\nlaws even in the absence of specific legislation; It clears the misconception that there is no\\n“damages culture” in India for violation of IP rights; This case reaffirms IP owners’ faith in\\nthe Indian judicial system’s ability and willingness to protect intangible property rights and\\nsend a strong message to IP owners that they can do business in India without sacrificing\\ntheir IP rights.\\n10. Infinity e-Search BPO Case \\nThe Gurgaon BPO fraud has created an embarrassing situation for Infinity e-Search, the\\ncompany in which Mr Karan Bahree was employed.\\nA British newspaper had reported that one of its undercover reporters had purchased\\npersonal information of 1,000 British customers from an Indian call-center employee.\\nHowever, the employee of Infinity eSearch, a New Delhi-based web designing company,\\nwho was reportedly involved in the case has denied any wrongdoing. The company has also\\nsaid that it had nothing to do with the incident.\\nIn the instant case the journalist used an intermediary, offered a job, requested for a\\npresentation on a CD and later claimed that the CD contained some confidential data. The\\nfact that the CD contained such data is itself not substantiated by the journalist.\\nIn this sort of a situation we can only say that the journalist has used “Bribery” to induce a\\n“Out of normal behavior” of an employee. This is not observation of a fact but creating a\\nfactual incident by intervention. Investigation is still on in this matter.
     TUKUTANE is an indigenous, non-governmental and not for profit humanitarian organization incepted in 2012 by Tanzanian volunteers who committed to promote a proactive strategy of poverty alleviation, aimed at supporting women and children, and keeping families intact.\\n\\n     Women bear almost all responsibility for meeting needs of the family, yet they are systematically denied from all resources, information and freedom of action they need to full fill this responsibility. The majority of country's poor populations are women; two-thirds of the Tanzanians' illiterates are females, and studies also show that, HIV/AIDS is rapidily becoming a woman's disease. In Tanzania, three-quarters of all young people living with HIV are women.\\n\\n     From the thousands of school age children who are deprived from going to school, the majority of them are girls. The current country food price crisis is having a severe impact on women and children. In our country, thousands of people eat two or three times a day, but a significant percentage of women and children eat only once. In fact many women skip their one time meal to ensure that their children are fed. These women are already suffering the effects of even more severe malnutrition, which inevitably will be their children's fate as well. The impact of this crisis is clearly visible on the children. They are often abandoned by their suffering mothers. If not abandoned they are abused and exploited.\\n\\n     Studies have shown that when women are supported and empowered then the who society gets benefited. Because of which their families remain healthy, more children attend schools, agricultural productivity improves and family income increase. In short, communities become more resilient.\\n\\n      TUKUTANE firmly believes that empowering women and children would be the agent that proves to be an essential element for achieving the end of hunger and poverty. We support women and children and build their capacity. TUKUTANE envisages Tanzania where all women and children have access to their rights and have privilege to development; and are protected from all forms of harassment and exploitation.

These women are already suffering the effects of even more severe malnutrition, which inevitably will be their children's fate as well. The impact of this crisis is clearly visible on the children. They are often abandoned by their suffering mothers. If not abandoned they are abused and exploited.\\n\\n     Studies have shown that when women are supported and empowered then the who society gets benefited. Because of which their families remain healthy, more children attend schools, agricultural productivity improves and family income increase. In short, communities become more resilient.\\n\\n      TUKUTANE firmly believes that empowering women and children would be the agent that proves to be an essential element for achieving the end of hunger and poverty. We support women and children and build their capacity. TUKUTANE envisages Tanzania where all women and children have access to their rights and have privilege to development; and are protected from all forms of harassment and exploitation.

To import alcoholic beverages into the United States the general rule is that one must possess both the appropriate State and Federal beverage alcohol licenses.  (Unless the distinction is important, the works "permit" and "license" will be used interchangably)  \\n\\nFor licensing, labeling and tax purposes, alcoholic beverages are catagorized as wine, malt beverage (ie:  beer, ale) or distilled spirits.\\n\\nFederal law requires that one obtain a "basic permit" to import the appropriate type of alcohol for commercial purposes.  \\n\\nFederal law and regulations also require each container of beverage alcohol be labeled with a standard health warning statement in any case where the alcohol may be sold or "distributed".  The term "distributed" is interpreted broadly and is not restricted to sales or commercial transactions.  (27 CFR Part 16.)  Note that the law and regulations provide for a civil penalty of $11,000 per violation.\\n\\nTo import alcoholic beverages without a permit, the importer must qualify for an exception to the general rule.  Only the Federal law is consistent throughout the United States.  Each State has its own beverage alcohol law and there are great differences from State to State.  Three persons from three different States attempting to import identical types and quantities of alcohol can easily\\n\\nConnecticut\\n\\nMassachusetts\\n\\nNew Jersey\\n\\nNew York\\n\\nPennsylvania
Media Studies\\n\\n We have all grown up in environments saturated with media experiences. The media are familiar and one of our first aims will be to make them strange - to allow you to distance yourself from something you know, in order to look at it differently. This familiarity, and the expectations it arouses, also creates problems for a Media Studies textbook. TV, from children's programs through educational TV, to the vast range of broadcast material has probably taught you a great deal, in ways which books cannot hope to emulate. You may also have quite sophisticated experience of computers, at home and at college, including interactive forms like CD-ROMS and the internet. Modern technologies have dazzling capacities. It is now possible, using digital imaging, to make it seem as though Marilyn Monroe and Brad Pitt are playing a scene together or that Earth can morph into an apple before our eyes; to broadcast such scenes and simultaneously \\nacross continents; and to accompany them with music created entirely by computer. The internet has been touted, like many earlier technologies, everything is readily available and all questions can be answered.
\\n== '''South China Learning Institute''' ==\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South China Learning Institute (SCLI) was established by an organization of American and European professionals who have lived and worked throughout China for many years. The creation of the Institute was a response to what they saw as a need for greater learning and exchange between China and other nations and the immense opportunities that China now offers. They decided to locate the Institute in Shenzhen, a city with 10 million people, in response to the dynamism and extreme growth that has defined the Pearl River Delta region for the past 20 years.\\n\\n\\nSCLI accepts participants from all backgrounds seeking a deeply productive China learning experience, be it in language or otherwise.\\n\\n\\nSCLI offers Intensive Mandarin Language courses, featuring classroom study, exchange, and a wide selection of unique cultural and educational electives. Additionally, SCLI offers programs involving internship placements with major international companies in Shenzhen.\\n\\n\\nSCLI provides all participants with lodging, travel support, and many exciting travel excursions around China. SCLI offers a variety of packages built to accommodate all levels of Mandarin skills, interests, and time frames. For lodging, students have the option to choose between a home stay program with a Chinese family, or a more communal setting with peers in downtown Shenzhen.
A general definition of an ecological crisis the occurrences when the environment of species or a population changes in a way that destabilizes its continued survival. The main cause of the ecological crisis are human induced activities or anthropocentric acts like mining, pollution, deforestations, construction etcetera, for the global economy to grow.\\nThe solutions to the contemporary ecological crisis is sustainable development. Sustainable development is a type of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, not only for anthropocentric reasons but nature holistically. The concept of sustainable will be successful when the current population stabilize for natural resources to be evenly distributed’ for developed countries like the United States not to consume products that they do not need but they can rather make it accessible to countries who need those resources. \\nThe lifestyle as humans that we all should adopt is a culture of living in an environmentally friendly way. Like reusing, afforestation, and adopting traditions that have certain laws to use the environment sufficiently. The ideas of Saint Francis should be implemented because humans tend to have an idea that they are not part of nature or rather superior than nature which is not the case. \\nThe reason why human beings cause environmental degradation is because of the capitalistic regime. Humans in the ancient stages of life lived sustainably were they were part of nature. Nowadays humans maximize the use of natural resources to maximize their profits. That is why nature is exploited, it is a tool to produce and gain a lot of profit which will impact negatively now and in future.\\nHumans now have the obligation to make amends to the natural environment. Already climatic activities have been altered because of the human induced factors now it is up to humans to be part of nature. Humans need to be ethical about the actions that they act on.
Deficitis\\n\\n  Deficitis is a devastating disease where an organ eating parasite called Numotoma eats away at the internal organs until the host dies. The first warning sign of Deficitis is coughing. An infected individual may also suffer from vomiting, diarrhea, uncontrollable bowels, and in the worst cases neck spasms. It is mainly contracted from the common house cat. In order to avoid this disease, your cat must be sprayed with Windex at least 2 times a day. It is the only known chemical able to break down the virus. The Isopropanal found in Windex is what breaks down the genetic structure of Numotoma. Not much is known about Deficitis or the Numotoma parasite associated with it.
== Nikos D. A. Arvanites\\nSince graduating in International Politics and Economics in Athens, Nikolaos Arvanites has been researching and writing on many aspects of international relations in his home region, the Balkans.  \\n\\nFor the last twenty years Nikolaos has been based in Belgrade and Kragujevac, working as a freelance journalist and continuing his studies in international criminal law. \\n\\nThe essays contained in his books and articles reflect –once more- his understanding of the complex interaction between ethnic, economic and criminal forces,  on a local and international level, that have resulted in so much disruption in this part of the world. His insatiable curiosity has led him deep into the convoluted politics of the region. \\n\\nOn what he terms the micro level his research has focused on regions, groupings and issues often passed over by other journalists and academics. \\n\\nOn the "macro" level he has been at pains to discover how these local issues feed into wider geopolitical processes in a world of rapidly changing technologies. \\n\\n Nikolaos has an unparalleled grasp of the written sources, both print and electronic. He combines this with the journalist's willingness to travel and ability to find and get information from people actively involved with the processes he seeks to explain. \\n\\nTogether these abilities make his work essential reading for those interested in extending their knowledge of this turbulent region.
An addictive personality refers to a particular set of personality traits that make an individual predisposed to addictions. Addictions are characterized by a physical or psychological dependency that negatively impacts the quality of life of the person. They are frequently connected with substance abuse, but people with addictive personalities are also highly at risk of becoming addicted to gambling, food, exercise, work, and even relationships (codependency) ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). People engaged in addictive behavior tend to plan their lives around it ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). Scientists have been able to better understand addictive personalities as researchers delve further into understanding the chemistry of addiction. Alan R. Lang of Florida State University and author of an addiction study prepared for the National Academy of Sciences said, “If we can better identify the personality factors, they can help us devise better treatment and can open up new strategies to intervene and break the patterns of addiction” (Nelson). \\n\\n==Description==\\nAddictive personality disorder can be defined as a psychological setback that makes people more susceptible to addiction.  This can include anything from drug and alcohol abuse to pornography, gambling, videogames, food, exercise, work and even relations with others.  Experts describe the spectrum of behaviors designated as addictive in terms of five interrelated concepts which include patterns, habits, compulsions, impulse control disorders, and physical addiction ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). An individual is considered to be at the risk of developing such addictions when he/she displays signs of impulsive behavior, nonconformity combined with a weak commitment to the goals for achievement valued by the society, a sense of social alienation, and a sense of heightened stress (Nelson). Such a person may switch from one addiction to another other or even sustain multiple addictions at different times (Mason).\\n\\n==Signs and Symptoms==\\nThe people suffering from addictive personality disorder are currently defined to have a “brain disease” as promoted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and other authorities (Addictive Behaviors 3). People with addictive personalities are very much sensitive to stress. They have trouble handling situations that they deem frustrating, even if the event is for a very short duration. They often lack self-esteem and will show impulsive behavior such as excessive caffeine consumption, eating of chocolates or other sugar laden foods, television watching, or even running (Nelson).\\n\\nMood swings and antisocial behavior are other visible traits of people that suffer from addictive personality disorder. They may turn down invitation to social gatherings in order to alienate themselves from their respective societies.  The main reason behind such behavior is that they are fearful of being caught with this disorder.  The feeling of isolation will often have negative effects on the people that facing the issue, and so to substitute for the lack of personal relationships, they turn towards drugs, smoking, alcohol consumption, or the like.  They usually will believe that such harmful substances serve as “quick-fix" solutions for their life's problems ("Addiction/Addictive Personality").\\n\\nPeople suffering from APD find it difficult to manage their stress levels. In fact, lack of stress tolerance is a telltale sign of the disorder. They find it difficult to face stressful situations and fight hard to get out of such conditions (Mason).\\n\\nLong term goals prove difficult to achieve because people with APD usually focus on the stress that comes with getting through the short term goals.  Such personalities will often switch to other enjoyable activities the moment that they are deprived of enjoyment in their previous addiction.\\n\\nAddictive individuals feel highly insecure when it comes to relationships. They may often find it difficult to make commitments in relationships or trust their beloved because of the difficulty they find in achieving long term goals. They constantly seek approval of others and as a result, and these misunderstandings may contribute to the destruction of relationships.  People suffering from addictive personality disorder usually undergo depression and anxiety, managing their emotions by developing addiction to drugs, alcohol or other pleasurable activities (Nelson).\\n\\n\\n==Common Forms of Addictive Behavior==\\nSubstance abuse and dependence is one of the most common displays of addictive personalities. Alcohol is the most frequently abused psychoactive substance and affects over 20 million Americans—13 percent of the adult population ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). Aside from alcohol, other psychoactive drugs commonly abused include barbiturates, narcotics, stimulants, anti-anxiety drugs, and psychedelics and hallucinogens ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). While drug abuse and dependence can happen to anyone, it is significantly more likely to occur in the presence of an addictive personality. \\n\\nAnother common addiction that may attract those with addictive personalities is gambling. When an addict behaves mindlessly and irresponsibly while gambling, it can grow to be a bigger problem. There are said to be three stages a gambler with an addictive personality goes through (Eng). The first is the “winning phase” in which the person can still control his or her own behavior. Second comes the “losing phase” where the individual starts to gamble alone, borrowing cash and gambling large sums of money compiling debt which he or she may not be able to pay off. Finally, the “desperation phase” of the addictive behavior gambler is when the person takes further risks, may engage in illegal loans and activities and even experience depression or attempt suicide (Eng). \\n\\nAddictive personality behaviors even include eating disorders, such as anorexia, bulimia and compulsive overeating. Those with anorexia nervosa are not content with his or her physical image, and in turn constantly starve him or herself in order to feel beautiful. Once a person starts dieting, it is very difficult for him or her to quit. This is similarly true for those suffering from bulimia. A person is said to have bulimia when he or she binges on large amounts of food and then prevents absorption by purging (laxatives, vomiting, water pills, etc) (Eng). With compulsive eating, the person has a compulsive urge or craving to eat and will eat even when not hungry. This addictive behavior often results in obesity. \\n\\nThree increasingly more common displays of addictive personalities include work and exercise. Our society rewards those who work hard. But work may become an obsession if family, friends, interests and hobbies have suddenly become unimportant. Likewise, an extreme commitment to exercise that can sometimes lead to self destructive and harmful behavior is an example of addictive behavior. \\n\\n==Treatment==\\nAddictive personalities and the subsequent addictions are difficult to treat. Addictive behavior often involves long term psychological ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). Physical addictions even alter an individual’s brain chemistry making the road to recovery longer and more difficult. Often the person with a physical addiction cannot be exposed to the addictive habit without lapsing back into addiction. This is why rates of being “cured” are often closely followed by setbacks. The first step in the recovery process of addictive behaviors is to admit that there is a problem and seek help. Medical intervention may be necessary for those who engage in substance abuse—medication is often used to treat withdrawal symptoms and treat for malnutrition. Many forms of psychological intervention are also available to those with addictive personalities including counseling and inpatient programs, group therapy, environmental intervention and behavior therapy ("Addiction/Addictive Personality").\\n\\n==References==\\n* "Addiction/Addictive Personality."

I am trained in biochemistry at a liberal arts college.  My first and only fluent language is English, although I've taken a major interest in Spanish and also Greek, Latin and maybe even French.  I am also interested in food, music, health, math, computers, physics, systems and informatics, and business and money.  I have never been intrinsically interested in social studies including the broad areas of politics and sociology; I do however try to make concerted efforts to learn within these areas.\\n\\nOn the topic of Wikipedia, I believe this is a powerful and invaluable resource for the world.  I do acknowledge the concerns -- aired mostly by academics -- that open editing compromises the potential accuracy of Wikipedia articles.  However, as long as academics and general users at large understand the value of this online resource as an indicator of the general public's knowledge about included topics, we can better appreciate and use this information concurrent with a healthy skepticism.
As a physicist and chemical engineer, my scientific loyalties sometimes conflict with my spiritual loyalties.   As a philosopher, seeking eternal, universal truths, my discoveries are being chronicled in a book which I call, True Freedom, which finds much resonance with Ayn Rand's Objectivism and Individualism.\\n\\nTrue Freedom requires individual equality, lest one person or group infringe upon the freedoms of others.  Therefore privacy establishes impartiality and fairness.  Privacy protects individuals from inequality by restricting the ability to discern and thus segregate individuals or groups by any particular characteristic.  Security requires that every person be uniquely, positively, and easily identified so that trust may abound and privacy may be most fully preserved.  True Democracy extends equality by allowing every citizen an equal voice in matters of governance (that there may be no masters or tyrants).
Shower science: scientific research or empirical study to discover laws governing the operation and practical use of any showering system being domestic, commercial, military, aerospace, hybrid or other.\\n\\nThe advent of "hybrid showering systems" is rather new. Powerful consumption made possible by a highly automated destruction of vast quantities of hydrocarbons from the Earth, have in a sense over a short time developed a "blind spot" that camouflages the heinous waste of thermal energy, water, and consumables like soap that the contemporary but still extremely primitive bathroom shower system requires to operate.\\n\\nIt was found that only one energy saving hybrid showering system could save energy than a small town where all the lights were on only.\\n\\nThe practical laws that govern "extreme waste" in contemporary showers was first discovered by Michael Vittorio Collalto who in the period during 1986 and particularly from 1994 onwards set about materializing what has become this worlds first "hybrid showering system".\\n\\nIt gradually incorporated a research facility, used to test the hypothesis amongst others that the shower seemed to be no better than an efficient "cooling tower", amazingly adverse to the aim of providing a warm or hot environment.\\n\\nIt mimics the operation of a cooling tower in almost every respect.\\n\\nThe similarities are staggering.\\n\\n(used to cool water in order to improve the efficiency of the refrigeration cycle in larger applications. e.g. commercial buildings.)\\n\\nA technology specifically to remove thermal potential from water efficiently. \\n\\nA further observation has persisted, that according to this discovery, although it might seem desirable to recover heat at the drain from the showering process and others like in the kitchen sink, most of the thermal potential in typical primitive showering systems is removed well before the water reaches the drain where any substantially meaningful recovery can occur.
A large proportion of homes include traditional radiators for heating, which over the years, have been mainly left uncovered, but due to growing demand and the awareness caused by exposure on TV shows, radiator cabinets have changed from an upmarket fashion accessory to an essential item in the home. Providing effective protection against coming into contact with hot surfaces is important for all members of the family, especially the young and elderly. Adding covers eliminates the likelihood of this occurring whilst creating attractive room features throughout the home. An ever increasing selection of cabinets in a variety of styles and finishes is available nationwide in standard sizes to cover the majority of UK radiators and adjustable versions are also available. These are designed to fit a number of different sized radiators by adjusting in width to provide a custom made look. With special made to measure services ensuring non-standard radiators can also be covered, homeowners will welcome the safety and aesthetic benefits of adding radiator cabinet.
\\n== History ==\\n\\nOver the past 20 years, the Dutch Postcode Lottery raised almost 3 billion euros in the Netherlands to support civil society: environmental protection, the conservation of nature, human rights and sustainable development. From the very beginning the lottery supported charitable organisations both international and in the Netherlands by raising money through a lottery and informing the public about the work of the charities concerned. With its 2.5 million participants, the lottery has grown to become the Netherlands’ biggest charity lottery and it supports 75 charitable organisations.\\n\\n== International Scope ==\\n\\nThe Postcode Lottery was also introduced internationally and is now established and successful in Sweden, England and Scotland. The mission of the Postcode Lotteries is to achieve a better world for people and nature; a world in which all people, animals and plants can live healthily, and are treated justly and with respect.\\nThe Postcode Lotteries believe in an entrepreneurial, innovative and creative approach
