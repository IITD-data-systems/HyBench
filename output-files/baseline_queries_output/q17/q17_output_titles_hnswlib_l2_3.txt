Power Electronics Education E-Book\\n\\nwww.peeeb.com\\n\\nDr. Firuz Zare\\n\\n'Globalization' is a simple way of describing the spread of communication and technologies across the world. As the store of knowledge expands throughout the world, all of the world’s people should have as much access as possible. There are a range of new technologies and techniques such as the Internet, World Wide Web and other electronic media forms that allow for the dissemination of data, information and knowledge. These advanced information and communications technologies can provide a new learning system that aid professors and students in breaking the boundaries of space and time and assist students in gaining the skills and abilities and utilise knowledge contained in various forms in our global. I believe there is a need for enhanced virtual and networked activity to support learning and share our knowledge especially in some developing countries! After many years working in industry and university, I have decided to share my knowledge and experience with all students in the world who study Electrical Engineering. Now, it is not a dream anymore! In this website, you can virtually attend my lectures, tutorials, computer Labs and quizzes and also access to lecture notes.
ALIA Institute\\n\\nThe ALIA Institute is a non-profit charitable organization located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It aims to support community and organizational leaders by bringing together systems-oriented tools and perspectives with the values and practices of authentic leadership. \\n\\nThe Institute began in 1998 as a dialogue among members of the Shambhala meditation community who were actively engaged in business, education, and civil society, and pioneering leaders in the fields of organizational and societal change - pathfinders such as Peter Senge, Margaret Wheatley, Juanita Brown, David Isaacs, and Art Kleiner. The intention behind this exploration was to discover a new model of leadership development that would adequately prepare organizational leaders for the challenges of the 21st century. This model would bring together Shambhala, as a source of pre-industrial wisdom and practices for realizing the potential of individuals and societies, with post-industrial research and methodologies related to leadership and whole-systems change.\\n\\nThis fusion turned out to be a powerful support for more effective action, especially in the domains of innovation, strategy, collaboration, and large-scale transformative change. It resulted in the week-long Authentic Leadership Summer Program, which was first offered in Nova Scotia in June 2001 and which has convened annually ever since.
KSDF’S STATEMENT ON INTERNATIONAL DAY OF ACTION FOR RIVERS\\n\\nDated: New Delhi, 14 March 2008\\n\\nOn this day, the 11th International Day of Action for Rivers, the Kuki Students Democratic Front and the Burma Rivers Network are calling for an end to the destructive Tamanthi Dam and all other mega dams in Burma. \\n\\nIndian, Chinese, and Thai companies are planning large dams across all of Burma’s major rivers and their tributaries. In collaboration with the Government of India, the 1,200 megawatt “Tamanthi Dam and Multi Purpose Project” is being implemented since 2005 by Indian Government in collaboration with National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC). This project is in the heart of ethnic Kuki inhabited areas in Sagaing Division, where the local people from the dam site Tazone Shan and Leivomjang Kuki village have already been relocated from their ancestral land and many more villages to be relocate if the construction is to be continues. \\n\\nThe dam will adversely affect the rich biodiversity and ecological balance in the region due to dramatic changes in the morphology of the riverbed. Burma’s Tamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary that provides habitat for many endemic species of flora and fauna will also be impacted. From 1990 to 2005, Burma lost 18% of its forest cover due to damming and logging. This is one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world. \\n\\nIn recent years, Chinese companies have been involved in the planning of 25 large dams on the Irrawaddy, Salween, and Sittaung rivers or their tributaries. The dams have an estimated combined capacity of 30,000 megawatts and represent US$30 billion worth of investment. Large-scale displacement, militarization, human rights abuse, and irreversible environmental damage due to the dam projects are threatening the livelihoods and food security of millions. \\n\\nThe bulk of the electricity generated from these projects is slated to be exported to neighbouring countries or will be consumed by military bases. Revenues from the sale of electricity will provide significant long-term income to the military regime which spends 40% of its budget on defense while the expenditure on health and education is below 5%.\\n\\nThe number of military battalions stationed near dam site areas has tripled in the last ten years. In areas where many of the dams are being implemented war continues to take a heavy toll or serious tensions threaten the ceasefires with ethnic groups. At the same time, the crackdown on peaceful demonstrations of monks in late 2007 clearly shows the impossibility of public participation in decisions over energy policies in Burma.\\n\\nDam projects in Burma are going ahead without regard for internationally accepted standards laid out by the World Commission on Dams and the Equator Principles, which include public participation in decision making, effective environmental mitigation, and equitable benefit sharing. Therefore the Tamanthi Dam and all other mega dams in Burma must be stopped.\\n\\nKuki Students Democratic Front (KSDF)\\nBurma Rivers Network (BRN)\\n\\n\\n\\nBy. Mangneo
"Anorexia mirabilis literally means "miraculous lack of appetite". It refers almost exclusively to women and girls of the Middle Ages who would starve themselves, sometimes to the death, in the name of God. The phenomenon is also known by the name "inedia prodigiosa" (a great starvation).[1]\\n\\nAnorexia mirabilis differs from the more modern, well-known anorexia nervosa in several distinct ways.\\n\\nIn anorexia nervosa, people usually starve themselves to attain a level of thinness, as the disease is associated with body image distortion. By contrast, anorexia mirabilis was frequently coupled with other ascetic practices, such as lifelong chastity, flagellant behavior, the donning of hairshirts, sleeping on beds of thorns, and other assorted self mutilations. It was largely a practice of Catholic women, who were often known as "miraculous maids".\\n\\nUntil recently, plumpness was a clear sign of affluence, and emaciation either a sign of poverty, ill health, or both. Women did not typically begin depriving themselves of food for outer beauty until the Victorian era, they did however starve themselves for spiritual fulfillment."
{{Business administration}}\\n{{short description|Trade of goods, services, technology, capital's and/or knowledge at a transnational scale}}\\n'''International business''' refers to the trade of Goods and service goods, services, technology, capital and/or knowledge across national borders and at a global or transnational scale. \\n\\nIt involves cross-border [[Financial transaction|transactions]] of goods and services between two or more countries. Transactions of economic resources include capital, skills, and people for the purpose of the international production of physical goods and services such as finance, banking, insurance, and construction. International business is also known as [[globalization]].\\n\\nInternational business encompasses a myriad of crucial elements vital for global economic integration and growth. At its core, it involves the exchange of goods, services, and capital across national borders. One of its pivotal aspects is globalization, which has significantly altered the landscape of trade by facilitating increased interconnectedness between nations. International business thrives on the principle of comparative advantage, wherein countries specialize in producing goods and services they can produce most efficiently. This specialization fosters efficiency, leading to optimal resource allocation and higher overall productivity. Moreover, international business fosters cultural exchange and understanding by promoting interactions between people of diverse backgrounds. However, it also poses challenges, such as navigating complex regulatory frameworks, cultural differences, and geopolitical tensions. Effective international business strategies require astute market analysis, risk assessment, and adaptation to local customs and preferences. The role of technology cannot be overstated, as advancements in communication and transportation have drastically reduced barriers to entry and expanded market reach. Additionally, international business plays a crucial role in sustainable development, as companies increasingly prioritize ethical practices, environmental responsibility, and social impact. Collaboration between governments, businesses, and international organizations is essential to address issues like climate change, labor rights, and economic inequality. In essence, international business is a dynamic force driving economic growth, fostering global cooperation, and shaping the future of commerce on a worldwide scale.\\n\\nTo conduct business overseas, multinational companies need to bridge separate national [[Market (economics)|markets]] into one global marketplace. There are two macro-scale factors that underline the trend of greater globalization. The first consists of eliminating [[Trade barrier|barriers]] to make cross-border trade easier (e.g. free flow of goods and services, and capital, referred to as "[[free trade]]"). The second is technological change, particularly developments in communication, [[Electronic data processing|information processing]], and [[Freight transport|transportation]] technologies.\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nThe discourse surrounding international business has  a transition in terminology over the years, reflecting shifts in understanding and the expanding scope of cross-border commerce. Initially, phrases such as "foreign trade" and "foreign exchange" were prevalent, embodying a static view of cross-border interactions. However, the term "foreign" often evoked notions of remoteness or strangeness, failing to capture the dynamic essence of international engagements.\\n\\nAs commerce evolved with the advent of firms engaging in substantial direct investments across borders, newer terms  to encapsulate the changing landscape. The mid-19th century marked the rise of companies owning and controlling production facilities in various countries, a departure from the earlier norm where firms held minor or passive ("portfolio") investments abroad. This paradigm shift necessitated a fresh nomenclature, leading to the introduction of the term "multinational enterprise" (MNE), referring to entities with substantial operations in multiple nations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burleigh |first1=Thomas D. |title=The Indian Tree Pipit (Anthus hodgsoni) Recorded for the First Time in North America |journal=The Auk |date=1968 |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=323 |doi=10.2307/4083598 |jstor=4083598 }}</ref>\\n\\n"International business" is also defined as the study of the internationalization process of multinational enterprises. A [[multinational enterprise]] (MNE) is a company that has a worldwide approach to markets, production and/or operations in several countries. Well-known MNEs include fast-food companies such as: McDonald's (MCD), YUM (YUM), Starbucks Coffee Company (SBUX), etc. Other industrial MNEs leaders include vehicle manufacturers such as: Ford Motor Company, and General Motors (GMC). Some consumer electronics producers such as Samsung, LG and Sony, and energy companies such as Exxon Mobil, and British Petroleum (BP) are also multinational enterprises.\\n\\nMultinational enterprises range from any kind of business activity or market, from consumer goods to machinery manufacture; a company can become an international business. Therefore, to conduct business overseas, companies should be aware of all the factors that might affect any business activities, including, but not limited to: difference in legal systems, political systems, [[economic policy]], [[language barrier|language]], [[accounting standard]]s, [[International labour law|labor standards]], living standards, [[environmental standard]]s, [[culture|local culture]]s, [[Organizational culture|corporate cultures]], [[Foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange markets]], [[tariff]]s, [[import]] and [[export]] regulations, [[trade agreement]]s, [[climate]], and [[education]]. Each of these factors may require changes in how companies operate from one country to another. Each factor makes a difference and a connection.\\n\\nOne of the first scholars to engage in developing a theory of multinational companies was Canadian economist [[Stephen Hymer]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Buckley |first1=Peter J. |title=Stephen Hymer: Three phases, one approach? |journal=International Business Review |date=April 2006 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=140–147 |doi=10.1016/j.ibusrev.2005.03.008 }}</ref> Throughout his academic life, he developed theories that sought to explain [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) and why firms become multinational.\\n\\nThere were three phases of [[internationalization]] according to Hymer's work.<ref>{{cite thesis |last1=Hymer |first1=Stephen H. |title=The international operations of national firms, a study of direct foreign investment |date=1960 |hdl=1721.1/27375 |hdl-access=free }}{{pn|date=March 2024}}</ref> In this thesis, the author departs from [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical theory]] and opens up a new area of international production. At first, Hymer started analyzing neoclassical theory and [[financial investment]], where the main reason for [[capital movement]] is the [[Interest rate parity|difference in interest rates]]. After this analysis, Hymer analyzed the characteristics of foreign investment by large companies for [[Production (economics)|production]] and direct business purposes, calling this Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). By analyzing the two types of investments, Hymer distinguished financial investment from direct investment. The main distinguishing feature was control. [[Portfolio investment]] is a more passive approach, and the main purpose is [[Profit (economics)|financial gain]], whereas in foreign direct investment a firm has control over the [[Operations management|operations]] abroad. So, the traditional theory of investment based on differential interest rates does not explain the motivations for FDI.\\n\\nAccording to Hymer, there are two main determinants of FDI; where an [[imperfect market]] structure is the key element. The first is the [[Competitive advantage|firm-specific advantages]] which are developed at the specific companies home country and, profitably, used in the foreign country. The second determinant is the removal of control where Hymer wrote: "When firms are interconnected, they [[Competition (economics)|compete]] in selling in the same market or one of the firms may sell to the other," and because of this "it may be profitable to substitute centralized decision-making for [[decentralized decision-making]]".\\n\\nHymer's second phase is his neoclassical article in 1968 that includes a theory of internationalization and explains the direction of growth of the international expansion of firms. In a later stage, Hymer went to a more [[Marxian economics|Marxist]] approach where he explains that MNC as agents of an international capitalist system causing conflict and contradictions, causing among other things [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[poverty]] in the world. Hymer is the "father of the theory of MNEs", and explains the motivations for companies doing direct business abroad.\\n\\nAmong modern economic theories of multinationals and foreign direct investment are [[internalization theory]] and [[John Harry Dunning|John Dunning's]] [[Eclectic paradigm|OLI paradigm]] (standing for ''ownership, location and internationalization''). Dunning was widely known for his research in economics of international direct investment and the multinational enterprise. His OLI paradigm, in particular, remains as the predominant theoretical contribution to study international business topics. Hymer and Dunning are considered [[Organizational founder|founders]] of international business as a specialist [[field of study]].\\n\\n==Physical and social factors of competitive business and social environment==\\nThe conduct of international operations depends on a company's objectives and the means with which they carry them out. The operations affect and are affected by the physical and societal factors and the [[competitive]] [[social environment|environment]].\\n\\n===Operations===\\nAll firms that want to go international have one goal in common; the desire to increase their respective [[Economic value added|economic values]] when engaging in international trade transactions. To accomplish this goal, each firm must develop its individual strategy and approach to maximize [[Value (economics)|value]], lower costs, and increase profits.  A firm's value creation is the difference between {{Math|''V''}} (the value of the product being sold) and {{Math|''C''}} (the cost of production per each product sold).{{sfn|Hill|2014|p=382}}\\n\\n[[Value creation]] can be categorized as: ''primary activities'' ([[research and development]], production, marketing and sales, [[customer service]]) and as ''support activities'' (information systems, logistics, human resources).{{sfn|Hill|2014|p=383}} All of these activities must be managed effectively and be consistent with the [[Corporate strategy|firm strategy]]. However, the success of firms that extend internationally depends on the goods or services sold and on the firm's core competencies (Skills within the firm that competitors cannot easily match or imitate). For a firm to be successful, the firm's strategy must be consistent with the environment in which the firm operates. Therefore, the firm needs to change its [[organizational structure]] to reflect changes in the setting in which they are operating and the strategy they are pursuing.\\n\\nOnce a firm decides to enter a foreign market, it must decide on a mode of entry. There are six different modes to enter a foreign market, and each mode has [[wiktionary:pros and cons|pros and cons]] that are associated with it. The firm must decide which mode is most appropriately aligned with the company's goals and objectives.  The six different modes of entry are exporting,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp|title=Export|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-19|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}</ref> [[turnkey project]]s, [[License|licensing]], [[franchising]], establishing [[joint venture]]s with a host-country firm, or setting up a new [[wholly owned subsidiary]] in the host country.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=453–454}}\\n\\nThe first entry mode is [[exporting]]. Exporting is the sale of a product in a different national market than a centralized hub of manufacturing. In this way, a firm may realize a substantial [[Economies of scale|scale of economies]] from its global sales revenue. As an example, many [[Automotive industry in Japan|Japanese automakers]] made inroads into the [[Automotive industry in the United States|U.S. market]] through exporting.  There are two primary advantages to exporting:  avoiding high costs of establishing manufacturing in a host country (when these are higher) and gaining an [[Experience curve effects|experience curve]].  Some possible disadvantages to exporting are high transport costs and high [[Tariff|tariff barriers]].{{sfn|Hill|2014|p=454}}\\n\\nThe second entry mode is a turnkey project. In a turnkey project, an independent contractor is hired by the company to oversee all of the preparation for entering a foreign market.  Once the preparation is complete and the end of the contract is reached, the plant is turned over to the company fully ready for operation.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=454–455}}\\n\\nLicensing and franchising are two additional entry modes that are similar in operation. Licensing allows a [[licensor]] to grant the rights to an intangible property to the licensee for a specified period of time for a royalty fee. Franchising, on the other hand, is a specialized form of licensing in which the "franchisor" sells the [[intangible property]] to the franchisee, and also requires the franchisee operate as dictated by the franchisor.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=456–457}}\\n\\nLastly, a joint venture and wholly owned subsidiary are two more entry modes in international business. A ''joint venture'' is when a firm created is jointly owned by two or more companies (Most joint venture are 50-50 [[partnership]]s). This is in contrast with a wholly owned subsidiary, when a firm owns 100 percent of the [[Capital stock|stock]] of a company in a foreign country because it has either set up a new operation or [[Corporate acquisition|acquires]] an established firm in that country.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=457–458}}\\n\\n====Types of operations====\\n[[Export]]s and [[import]] \\n* Merchandise exports: goods exported{{Em dash}}not including services.<ref>[http://thelawdictionary.org/merchandise-exports/ What is Merchandised Exports].

These channels play a crucial role in keeping stakeholders informed about global market trends, emerging opportunities, and potential risks. Here are some of the key types of international business media:\\n\\n*Industry-Specific Publications:* Specialized magazines, journals, and newsletters that focus on particular industries or sectors, providing in-depth analysis, expert commentary, and industry news.\\n\\n*Financial News Outlets:* Global media organizations that report on financial markets, economic developments, and business performance, offering insights into investment opportunities and economic trends.\\n\\n*Business Television Networks:* Broadcast and online channels dedicated to business news, featuring interviews with CEOs, market analysis, and reports on global business events.\\n\\n*Online Business Resources:* Websites, blogs, and social media platforms that provide news, analysis, and commentary on international business, often catering to specific regions or industries.\\n\\nIn addition  to traditional media, there are also a number of social media channels that focus on international business. These channels can be a good way to stay up-to-date on the latest news and developments, and they can also be a valuable platform for connecting with other businesses and professionals.\\n\\n===Physical and social factors===\\n* Geographical influences: There are many different geographic factors that affect international business.

This may cause aggravation to the people living there, which in turn can lead to a conflict. People want to live in a clean and quiet environment, without pollution or unnecessary noise. If a conflict arises, this may lead to a negative change in customer's perception of the company. Actual or potential threat of adverse effects on living organisms and environment by effluents, emissions, wastes, [[resource depletion]], etc., arising out of an organization's activities is considered to be risks of the environment.

In most cases, acts of terrorism is derived from hatred of religious, political and cultural beliefs. An example was the infamous [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], labeled as terrorism due to the [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks|massive damages]] inflicted on [[Society of the United States|American society]] and the global economy stemming from the animosity towards [[Western culture]] by some [[Radical Islam|radical Islamic groups]]. Terrorism not only affects civilians, but it also damages corporations and other businesses. These effects may include: physical [[vandalism]] or [[destruction of property]], sales declining due to frightened consumers and governments issuing public safety restrictions. Firms engaging in international business will find it difficult to operate in a country that has an uncertain assurance of safety from these attacks.<ref name="okolo2"/>\\n* '''Bribery'''\\n\\n[[Bribery]] is the act of receiving or soliciting of any items or services of value to influence the actions of a party with public or legal obligations. This is considered to an unethical form of practicing business and can have legal repercussions. Firm that want to operate legally should instruct employees to not involve themselves or the company in such activities. Companies should avoid doing business in countries where unstable forms of government exist as it could bring unfair advantages against domestic business and/or harm the social fabric of the citizens.\\n\\n==Factors towards globalization==\\nThere has been growth in [[globalization]] in recent decades due to the following factors.\\n\\n{{List incomplete|date=November 2018}}\\n\\n*[[Technology]] is expanding, especially in [[transportation]] and [[communications]].\\n*[[Governments]] are removing international business restrictions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\\n*[[Institutions]] provide services to ease the conduct of international business.\\n*[[Consumer]]s want to know about [[Foreign trade|foreign]] [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[service (economics)|services]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\\n*[[Competition]] has become more global.\\n*[[Political]] relationships have improved among some major [[economic]] powers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\\n*[[Countries]] cooperate more on transnational issues.\\n*[[Cross-national cooperation and agreements]] have increased.\\n\\n==Importance of international business education==\\n* Most companies are either international companies or [[Competition (economics)|compete]] with other international companies.\\n* Modes of [[Business operations|operation]] may differ from those used domestically.\\n* The best way of conducting business may differ by [[country]].\\n* An understanding helps one make better [[career]] decisions.\\n* An understanding helps one decide what [[Government policy|governmental policies]] to support.\\n\\nManagers in international business must understand [[social science]] disciplines and how they affect different functional business fields.\\n\\nTo maintain and achieve successful business operations in foreign nations, persons must understand how variations in culture and traditions across nations affect business practices. This idea is known as [[cultural literacy]]. Without knowledge of a host country's culture, corporate strategizing is more difficult and error-prone when entering foreign markets compared with the home country's market and culture. This can create a "blind spot" during the decision making process and result in [[ethnocentrism]]. Education about international business introduces the student to new concepts that can be applicable in international strategy in topics such as marketing and operations.\\n\\n===Importance of language and cultural studies===\\n\\nA considerable advantage in international business is gained through the knowledge and use of language, thereby mitigating a [[language barrier]]. A study by Lohmann (2011) in ''Economics Letters'' delved into the impact of language barriers on trade. The findings suggest that fluency in the local language can significantly enhance trade interactions.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lohmann |first=Johannes |date=2011-02-01 |title=Do language barriers affect trade? |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176510003617 |journal=Economics Letters |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=159–162 |doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2010.10.023 |issn=0165-1765}}</ref> Advantages of being an international businessperson who is [[Fluency|fluent]] in the [[local language]] include the following:\\n*Having the ability to directly communicate with employees and customers\\n*Understanding the manner of speaking within business in the local area to improve overall [[productivity]]\\n*Gaining respect of customers and employees from speaking with them in their native tongue\\n\\nIn many cases, it plays a crucial role. It is truly impossible to gain an understanding of a culture's buying habits without first taking the time to understand the culture.  Examples of the benefit of understanding local culture include the following:\\n*Being able to provide marketing techniques that are specifically tailored to the local market\\n*Knowing how other businesses operate and what might or might not be social taboos \\n*Understanding the time structure of an area.  Some societies are more focused on timeliness ("[[Punctuality|being on time]]") while others focus on doing business at "[[Business hours|the right time]]".\\n*Associating with people who do not know several languages.\\n*Language barriers can affect transaction costs. ''[[Linguistic distance]]'' is defined as the amount of variation one language has from another. For example, French, and Spanish are both languages derived from Latin. When evaluating dialogue in these languages, you will discover many similarities. However, languages such as English and Chinese or English and Arabic vary much more strongly and contain far fewer similarities. The [[writing system]]s of these languages are also different. The larger the linguistic distance there, the wider language barriers to cross. These differences can reflect on transaction costs and make foreign business operations more expensive.\\n\\n===Importance of studying international business===\\n\\nThe international business standards focus on the following:\\n*raising awareness of the inter-relatedness of one country's political policies and economic practices on another;\\n*learning to improve international business relations through appropriate communication strategies;\\n*understanding the global business environment—that is, the interconnections of cultural, political, legal, economic, and ethical systems;\\n*exploring basic concepts underlying [[international finance]], [[management]], [[marketing]], and trade relations; and\\n*identifying forms of business [[ownership]] and international business opportunities.\\nBy focusing on these, students will gain a better understanding of [[Political economy]]. These are tools that would help future business people bridge the economic and political gap between countries.\\n\\nThere is an increasing amount of demand for business people with an education in international business. A survey conducted by Thomas Patrick from [[University of Notre Dame]] concluded that [[bachelor's degree]] and [[master's degree]] holders felt that the training received through education were very practical in the working environment. Increasingly, companies are sourcing their human resource requirement globally.

\\nSemantic Web:\\n\\nToday we are living in the information age and society can be labeled as information society. Knowledge, a predominant element, pervades and dominates in the day-to-day activities in information society.  There is Emergence of internet and the development in ICT (Information Communications Technology), which affects every aspect of human life. Present rapid development in communication system and recent innovation in technology witnessed as changing emphasis in the role of information and management. The end users approach to meeting information needs is also rapidly getting transformed.  The new technologies have facilitated the transformation of data into digital formats. The availability and use of digital libraries is gradually becoming the norm for the provision of literature and information in all the fields and research. Digital Libraries are catering to information services interacting with online databases of journals and other resources Digital Library are important in creating, indexing and retrieving the various forms of digital resources.
Flipgigs is an online talent based student services marketplace connecting savvy consumers and businesses with an affordable network of talented , motivated, scrappy students from High Schools and Colleges who are eager to take on part-time jobs and gigs. \\n\\nFlipgigs was founded in the Spring of 2011 by Jayati Sengupta. According to Angel Investor Ron Conway, the most thought-provoking sector to develop in 2012 is the proliferation of peer-to-peer markets and the emergence of “collaborative consumption”. The age of so-lo-mo explosion has made it easier to share anything from resources to skills to assets and services.We are seeing a big shift in human relationships in the aftermath of web success in Facebook and LinkedIn era and I think this is just the beginning. A social platform like Flipgigs has the potential to very powerful. While everything else seems to be plummeting in today's tough economic times, one thing that continues to rise is the sticker price of college education. Moreover, with the stock market slump, the vast majority of parents are finding it extremely tough to dip into their dwindling retirement savings . Also, the student loan bubble is another bomb waiting to explode just like the housing mortgage crisis. That is where talent comes in. We already know students are very connected, resourceful and talented. We need a platform like Flipgigs to tap into this talent and have them find gigs easily. Students today need to start to wear a PIY attitude.(pay-it yourself)

{{Userspace draft|Aeolian processes on Mars|date=April 2010}}\\nSand dunes have been observed throughout the surface of the planet Mars.  Movement of these dunes has been theorized and inferred from the lack of craters on dunes.  Dune movement has not yet been directly imaged, however.  Understanding sand movement processes is vital to a correct Martian climate model, as well as the safety of future missions to Mars.\\n\\n==Introduction==\\nOn Earth, sand is a very plentiful resource.  Wind, water and ice, as well as chemical reactions and biological activity, all serve to break apart rocks and other solid material into sand on a large scale.  While much of this sand is quickly stabilized by biological and hydrological processes, and converted into sedimentary rock, some of it, especially in desert climates where these influences are minimal, remains in the form of unconsolidated sand and dust for thousands of years or more, subject to influence by the wind.    \\nSand is an especially interesting material to study because of its granular nature.  When acted upon by wind, sand behaves in ways that, at first glance, seem peculiar.  Instead of being deposited evenly along a surface, sand self-accumulates into ripples, drifts, and dunes.  It can be piled high, but can only sustain slopes up to the material's angle of repose for the local gravitational force, beyond which the pile will undergo gravitational collapse.\\n\\nSand dunes cover an estimated 5,000,000 km2 of Earth’s surface (more than half the area of the United States), mostly in desert climes and along shorelines (Hayward et al., 2007).  Where surface sand dominates, it can present a serious hazard to machinery when made airborne.  For example, sand storms famously foiled President Jimmy Carter's attempt to rescue American hostages being held in Iran in 1980.  Granules of sand and dust are so small that they can sneak through microscopic gaps into the workings of complex machinery, causing serious malfunctions and short-circuits.  The abrasive action of airborne sand can damage or destroy structures and equipment alike.  Unchecked, dunes can cover and rend useless vitually anything downwind: roads, machinery, even entire settlements (Hayward et al., 2007; Jones, 2001).\\n\\nIt has been apparent that dunes exist on Mars since 1971, when Mariner 9 imaged the first extraterrestrial dune fields (Iverson, 1976).  Observations of extensive dune fields across the Red Planet in 1972, as well as the absence of any substantial liquid water or geological activity on the present Martian surface, make it clear that aeolian processes are indeed the dominant geomorphic forces which are shaping present-day Mars (Phillips, 1998).\\nThe United States’ “Vision for Space Exploration” includes stipulations for future exploration of Mars by both unmanned probes and crewed missions (Bush, 2004).  With a clear goal of establishing the presence of complicated machinery, where great expenditures and potentially the lives of astronauts will be at stake, it is absolutely essential to understand the mechanics of aeolian processes as they take place on Mars.  An essential part of this understanding would be determining the activity of the current Martian surface.\\n\\nDespite several successful lander and rover missions to Mars in the past few decades, as well as a steady improvement in the resolution of images taken from orbit, there is still no hard evidence of dune movement anywhere on present-day Mars (Williams, 2006).  This study sought to use available imagery from Mars orbiters and Opportunity rover to search for any dune movement.  The analysis concluded that saltation is likely occurring during the most severe storms on present day Mars, and that one saltation event likely occurred as recent as July, 2007.  However, no conclusive evidence for dune movement on present-day Mars was found.\\n\\n==Background==\\n\\n===The nature of sand on Earth===\\nDeserts cover approximately 20% of Earth’s surface, and sand covers 20% of Earth’s deserts (Watson, 1997).  Sand is created by the erosion of rock containing quartz, feldspar, or other hard minerals, as well as the erosion of coral and volcanic glass.  It is mainly found near seashores, where it is created by wave action, along rivers, where rocks frequently collide in strong currents, and in deserts, where it is created by aeolian processes.\\n\\nIt seems natural, when dealing with a problem of sand movement, to first define exactly what sand is.  Sand is a subset of all granular materials.  Granular materials can be as large as boulders, and can be as small as 1 µm (the scale where thermal vibration effects become significant).  Sand can be defined as any granular material which can be influenced by fluid flow, however, this definition must be restricted one degree further by putting a limit on the diameter of the material’s individual grains.  The need for this restriction is clear; while both a fine powder and a heap of boulders fit neatly into the granular material definition, they behave quite unlike traditional sand under a fluid in motion. A powder will be dispersed quite quickly and suspended under the action of a typical wind, while larger rocks will be entirely unaffected, disregarding abrasive erosion.\\n\\nThe definition of sand used by Bagnold is a very good general one for the purpose of dune study (Bagnold, 1941).  A lower limit for sand grain size can be found by investigating the behavior of a fluid flowing over a granular surface.  In natural situations, fluid flow is very rarely fully laminar; it will contain eddies, or “gusts”, which represent a local increase in wind speed and change in direction.  Some of these eddies will be in an upward direction, giving the potential for small particles to be suspended.  However, nearer to the ground, the upward and downward components of the eddies are weaker than other directions. While the intensity of these upward gusts is variable, it is commonly approximated as 20% of the mean wind velocity (Alghamdi and Akyurt, 2001).  Therefore, any particle with a terminal velocity lower than 0.2 times the mean wind velocity will be carried up and suspended indefinitely, provided the wind keeps up. Any particle which can achieve this suspension is defined as dust.\\n\\nAn upper limit for sand grain size is even easier to define.  Sand moves through two modes of transport: saltation and surface creep.  There is an additional mode, reptation, which is the minor saltation of sand grains physically dislodged by impacting particles, which typically do not have the energy to dislodge further grains (Lancaster, 1995; Parteli, 2007).  However, as is apparent by the definition, reptation is merely a subset of saltation, and so shall be included within this category.\\n\\nSaltation is the process where by sand grains actually become airborne, while surface creep is sand movement by which the grains never actually leave the ground.  At some upper limit, however, the combination of wind pressure and sand impact are no longer sufficient to move a grain of sufficient size.  Grains which remain stationary even in the most intense wind are defined as pebbles.  Therefore, any granular material which does not fall under the definition of dust or pebbles is sand.\\n\\nNatural sand never consists of uniformly-sized grains.  There will always be some natural variation in the size of sand grains, even those formed from the same rock and by the same process.  The distribution of sand grain sizes is known as the grading of the sand.\\n\\n===Nature of sand movement===\\nFluid-based sand transport takes place close to the planetary surface, within what is known as the boundary layer; the layer of wind above the ground where surface friction affects the local wind velocity.  Within the boundary layer, wind tends to vary logarithmically by height, defined by Equation 1.  \\n\\n	 	1\\n\\nThe terms used in this equation will be defined later, however there is an important term to point out now: u*, which is known as the shear velocity.  The shear velocity is not an actual velocity, but a mathematical parameter of a wind profile with units of velocity.  The shear velocity is constant for a given wind profile, so it is considered more convenient, in discussions of sand movement and other near-surface processes, to refer to boundary layer winds in terms of shear velocity rather than actual velocity.  \\n\\nA single grain can be moved in a variety of ways.  It can be moved as part of a sand avalanche on a slip face or it can be knocked forward along the ground (or even into the air) by an impacting airborne grain.  When analyzing the initiation of sand movement, however, it is necessary to study the case where a sand grain is moved by the direct pressure of the wind.\\n\\nA sand sheet is obviously stable under a fluid with no velocity.  At very low velocities, friction between individual grains in the sand sheet keeps them from moving.  However, as wind velocity increases, eventually drag and lift forces overcome the forces of friction and gravity keeping the sand grains in place, and the most exposed sand grains will become airborne (Lancaster, 1995).\\n\\nA grain lifted in this manner will likely have a small initial velocity in relation to the mean wind velocity at its initial height.  Therefore, the faster wind will impart some of its momentum upon this grain, possibly reaching an equilibrium, where the grain is moving at the local wind speed.  However, the airborne state of the sand particle is short-lived.  When the particle impacts the sand bed, it transfers its momentum, usually into several sand grains.  In this way, even grains not exposed enough or too large to be moved by the fluid threshold shear velocity may be dislodged and set in motion, which initiates a type of sand movement known as saltation.  Saltation is a mode of sand movement involving short jumps by individual particles, and is the process by which approximately 75% of sand movement occurs (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\nWhen the grain impacts the sand bed, it creates a splash, which is the propulsion of multiple sand grains at the impact site into the wind stream.  If the wind remains constant at or above u*ft, the flux of saltating grains q will initially increase exponentially as more and more grains are impacted and driven into the wind stream.  Since each additional saltating grain draws more momentum from the wind, the wind speed in the saltation layer decreases.  Eventually, the system reaches an equilibrium airborne grain density, where the force of the wind lifts as many grains as it possibly can into saltation.\\n\\nIn addition to increasing the number of grains in saltation, impacting grains also serve to initiate another type of sand movement, known as surface creep.  Even though grains that are a bit too large to saltate by direct wind pressure can be dislodged by impacting grains, other grains are too large to become airborne even when given this extra boost of momentum.  However, if these grains are not too large, they may be knocked forward along the sand surface without ever becoming airborne.  This is the process of surface creep:  descending grains impact other larger grains, moving them forward slightly before friction stops them.\\n\\nOnce saltation has been initiated, the main producer of saltating particles is the impact of other saltating particles on the sand bed.  A peculiar consequence of this property is that after the initiation of saltation, the shear velocity may drop below u*ft, and saltation will still continue.  At this point, the fluid threshold shear velocity becomes unimportant, and a new, lower threshold comes to light.  It is only when the shear velocity drops below this new level, the impact threshold shear velocity (u*t), that saltation will cease.\\n\\nThe aforementioned saturation of the boundary layer is not an instantaneous process.  For any given grain distribution and wind speed, there is a lag between the time saltation is initiated and when the maximum grain density is reached.  The saturation length is the distance a parcel of fluid moves before achieving the maximum grain density (Bagnold, 1941).  It also represents a rough measure of the distance it takes for a change in one property of the wind flow to reform into a new velocity profile according to Equation 1.\\n\\nSand movement, taken on the level of individual grains, is understandably chaotic.  A single wind-blown grain impacting the surface can knock multiple grains into random trajectories.  However, taking the average paths of individual saltating grains gives the characteristic path for a given sand and wind.  The length of this path is the saltation length, Ls, an important parameter in many sand transport models, as well as in the formation of ripples, which will be described later (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\nThe velocity distribution of the wind in the boundary layer is roughly logarithmic by height, as can be seen in Equation 1.  However, the level at which the velocity actually drops to zero is slightly above the actual ground level.  In fact, for different values of shear velocity over the same surface, the wind speed drops to zero at the same height.  This term, z0, is known as the surface roughness, which will be explained later.  It changes greatly between different types of terrain, and is dependant mainly on the degree of sand movement and dominant grain size.\\n\\n==Physics of sand movement==\\nSand, a granular material, has some properties of a fluid, some properties of a solid, and some of neither.  As such, it requires unique equations to describe its behavior, particularly when under the influence of a flowing fluid.\\n\\nSome of the first equations to accurately predict the movement of sand and sand formations were formulated by Ralph A. Bagnold.  His book, Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes, was the first comprehensive study on all forms of sand transport.  It is still used actively many decades later, and may still be the best work on the physics of sand dunes.  Many of his original equations will be useful in this analysis.\\nWithin the planetary boundary layer, mean wind velocity u varies logarithmically with height z according to the relation shown here\\n\\n	 	1\\n\\nwhere κ = 0.40 is the von Kármán constant (AMS, 2000), u* is the wind shear velocity, and z0 is the surface roughness. The terms u∗ and z0 are independent variables which may be determined experimentally.  The von Kármán constant does not depend on atmospheric properties; it is an experimentally derived universal constant.  It should be noted that z0 is not an actual measure of surface roughness, but an apparent measure, which will be explained later.\\n\\nWith the wind velocity distribution known, it is natural to investigate what strength of wind is needed to initiate sand movement.  Individual sand grains are rough, irregular chunks of material, varying widely from the theoretical spherical shape.  Therefore, as Bagnold pointed out, it is convenient to find a scaling factor for determining the diameter of a sphere of equivalent composition as the non-spherical sand grains which will behave identically under the influence of a fluid.  This shape factor is dependant largely upon the amount of weathering that the sand has undergone, as well as the average grading of the sand.  It must often be determined experimentally; for desert sand on Earth, 0.75 is a good approximation. (Bagnold, 1941)  Multiplying the actual average diameter of sand grains by the shape factor yields the apparent grain diameter, which will be used from here on in place of the actual grain diameter.\\n\\nThere are actually two forces imparted upon an exposed sand grain by the wind. (Parteli, 2007)  The first, a drag force, is due to the friction of the moving air on the grain, and is in the direction of the fluid flow.  It is described by the equation\\n\\n	 	2\\n\\nwhere d is the diameter of the particle, σ is its density, β is a constant which depends on the packing of the grains, and u* is the shear velocity.  The second force, the lift force, is\\n\\n	 	3\\n\\nwhere Δp is the difference in pressure from the bottom to the top of the grain.  On the scale of sand grains, due to the strong velocity gradient near the surface, the lift force is very significant.  On Earth, it is approximately equal to 85% of the magnitude of the drag force. \\n\\nAt the initiation of sand movement, the drag and lift forces work to rotate the grain over some pivot point p.  These forces are resisted by the grain’s weight, which is \\n\\n	 	4\\n\\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid and g is the planetary gravitational constant.  Thus, with a momentum balance, it is easily possible to find the threshold parameters for grain movement.  \\n\\nThe forces balance over a pivot point p seen on the right.  Therefore, when (5) is true, \\n\\n	 	5\\n\\nthe saltation process begins (Parteli, 2007).\\n\\nThere are several important parameters which govern sand movement, as well as two important thresholds which indicate when movement will begin.  Under unchanging topographic conditions, the shear velocity is defined by another important quantity, the shear stress, τf according to the relation\\n\\n	           	6\\n\\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid.  The shear stress is merely a measure of the drag force per unit surface area.\\nAs the shear velocity increases, the drag force and lift force increase as well.  The value of u* where the inequality shown in (5) is true is called the fluid threshold shear velocity (u*ft).  An equation for u*ft is \\n\\n	 	7\\n\\nwhere A is the Shields parameter.  The Shields parameter has been determined experimentally in the past, and is relatively constant on Earth.  Under low atmospheric pressure, however, the Shields parameter has a complex dependence upon the grain diameter and wind velocity.\\n\\nAt the fluid threshold, the most exposed sand grains begin to be entrained in the fluid.  Because the velocity of the wind works parallel to the surface, the motion of the grain is temporary; soon, any upward motion of the grain is checked by the grain’s weight, and the grain impacts the sand bed some distance downstream (Bagnold, 1941).\\nAs mentioned above, the additional momentum imparted to grains on impact allows grains of larger sizes to enter saltation.  Thus after the initiation of saltation the impact threshold shear velocity (u*t) becomes the more important parameter.  It is typically near 80% of the value of u*ft (Parteli, 2007).  \\n\\nIf dune movement is indeed occurring, then an important factor to know is the sand flux q, or the weight of sand transported per second.  Here is where Bagnold’s work becomes insufficient, as his sand flux equations are fairly accurate, but do not predict the existence of a threshold velocity.  A universal sand flux equation, which has been confirmed by both wind tunnel and field experiments, here shown as Equation 8 (White, 1979; Lancaster, 1995).\\n\\n	 	8\\n\\nThe problem, then, for determining the existence of dune movement on Mars through calculation, lies in the knowledge of several key features of the local Martian surface.  Indeed, it is very possible that there are places on Mars where saltation still occurs, and others where aeolian features are “petrified”, no longer influenced by the prevailing winds.\\n\\n==Dune formation and movement==\\n\\n===Small-scale sandforms===\\nSand under the influence of wind can be found in many different formations, dependant upon many factors, including grain size, average shear velocity, sand availability, and the presence of obstacles.  Sandform is a generic term for any sandy deposit or formation.\\n\\nThe simplest sandform is one found in the wake of an immobile object, such as an exposed rock, known as a sand shadow (Bagnold, 1941).  Sand shadows are formed by deposition of sand in saltation due to localized reduction of shear velocity in the wind shadow of such an immobile object.  \\n\\nBehind any object within a fluid flow, there is a surface of discontinuity, outside of which the flow is roughly laminar near the mean wind speed, but inside of which is turbulent, with a mean velocity lower than the mean wind speed.  The reason that sand, not dust, is deposited in these areas is a direct consequence of the definition of sand we are using here.  While sand is highly influenced by the wind, it will tend to follow a uniform trajectory rather than a changing streamline in the wind.  So a grain flying over or around an object while in saltation may, by chance, fall into the wind shadow behind the object, where it will likely stay.  A dust grain in suspension, however, will tend to follow the changing streamlines and fly past the wind shadow.\\n\\nIn addition to sand deposits found in the wake, any obstacle will also have a small pile in front of it, due to yet another wind shadow in front.\\n \\nFigure 3: Wind flow around a surface object.  Sand will tend to accumulate in the wind shadow, where the wind is turbulent with a lower average speed\\n\\nA related sand formation is a sand drift, which forms in gaps between objects and in wind shadows caused by changes in terrain.  \\n\\nSand shadows and drifts require the presence of obstacles to alter the boundary layer fluid flow.  However, one of the most interesting properties of sand is that a flat sand sheet is unstable under a fluid flow.  The mechanism for this peculiar property becomes apparent when you analyze the case of saltation over a flat sheet of sand.  \\nTake the simplifying case of a flat sheet of sand undergoing a uniform barrage of saltating grains.  In addition to there being a characteristic path to describe the average path of saltating grains, it turns out that all grains descend at a very uniform angle of descent.  Because of this, the descending grains can be represented by parallel vectors, as in Figure 4.  \\n\\nA “flat” sand sheet can not be perfectly flat, as it consists of finite grains of roughly circular proportions.  As such, at any moment there exists a multitude of minuscule pits and discontinuities.  Figure 4 shows just such a deformation, where a small depression has formed momentarily due to a few saltating grains being removed.  Because of the near-uniform descent angle of grains in saltation, the existence of the depression causes more sand grains to impact in the downwind slope of the crater than the upwind slope.\\n\\nThe sand flux due to surface creep, qc, is proportional to the number of impacts per surface area.  Therefore, the downwind side of the temporary depression is suddenly subjected to a much higher sand flux.  Since there are now more grains moving out of the depression than into it, a continuous saltation will serve to deepen the depression and extend it downwind.\\n\\nWhen the sand surface begins to deviate from the ideal flat sand sheet case, the ideal situation seen in Figure 4 with an even distribution of descending grains at a constant angle no longer applies.  Knowing that saltating grains have a characteristic path, a grain leaving the sand bed at some point will tend to land very near to a point one saltation length downwind.  Therefore, if an area has a much higher sand flux due to increased saltation impacts, the same will apply for an area one saltation length downwind.  In this way, a single chance depression will soon become an extended area of sand ripples.  These sand ripples have a very regular wavelength which is dependent upon the prevailing wind speed, and is remains constant over time as long as the wind speed remains constant.\\n\\nThe shape and height of these ripples depends on the surface sand grading, or the distribution of sand grain size.  This can be deduced by a simple analysis of growing ripples:  as the height of each ripple increases, the average velocity at the grains will increase according to the boundary-layer wind distribution (Equation 1).  If the range of grain sizes in a particular sand bed is small, the higher wind speed at the top of ripples will tend to topple the grains at the crest into the next trough.  Therefore a narrower range of grain sizes will result in smaller ripples.  A wider range of grain sizes will allow for larger ripples.\\n\\nAs seen previously, an area of increased grain impacts will also see an increase in the grains moved by surface creep.  Therefore, if a significant portion of the grains in the sand bed can only move by surface creep, a different kind of sand formation will be seen.  In this case, after the initiation of saltation, the smaller grains are slowly removed until the larger grains begin to dominate.  Ripple-like formations will still emerge, but they will have essential differences.  Larger grains only capable of surface creep will begin collecting at each crest, creating a wind shadow for the subsequent trough similar to that in Figure 4.  Since the larger grains are moved much slower than the smaller grains, and cannot move in their own shadow due to a lack of saltation, the collection at each crest grows larger, as shown in Figure 5.  These features are known as ridges.\\n\\nAt some point, assuming uniform conditions throughout the sand bed, the ridges will grow large enough to shelter the troughs completely, halting saltation, and creating a stable configuration of small, steep-faced ripples.  However, a more common case is one where there is an oncoming saltation from upstream.  In this scenario, the surface creep will continue to build the ridges higher.  With higher ridges, the wind shadows grow longer, and subsequently the wavelength increases.  If saltation conditions prevail for long periods, ridges can grow indefinitely.  So unlike ripples, the wavelength of ridges does not depend on the mean wind velocity.\\n \\nFigure 5:  A typical ridge.  The line AC represents the wind shadow where no saltation or surface creep is taking place, the line DA is the area of maximum surface creep, and the line AB is where creeping grains from the crest are avalanching down the downwind slope.  From Bagnold, 1941.\\n\\nThere is a third feature, known as a megaripple, which can form under the same conditions as normal ripples.  They are widely spaced, less regular in their repetition than normal ripples.  It is unknown whether their wavelengths are dependant upon grain distribution or properties of the local wind regime.  Little is known about their genesis or evolution, and many consider them to be dunes rather than ripples or ridges, but they have been widely observed on the surface of Mars. \\n\\nOne important feature distinguishes ripples and ridges from other sand forms.  In ripples and ridges, the coarsest grains appear at the crests, with finer grains in the troughs.  The opposite is true for so-called large-scale sand formations, the majority of which are true sand dunes.\\n\\n===Dune formation===\\nThe genesis of dunes has actually been observed only rarely in any detail (Lancaster 1995).  Only a few studies have documented properties of dunes from formation until maturity, and these only noted the physical transformation of the dune, not the sand properties believed to be important in dune genesis.  The accepted theory regarding dune formation comes mainly from the study of mature dunes and wind tunnel scenarios, so there is an inherent uncertainty in the exact processes which take place.\\n\\nContrary to popular belief, a sandy desert floor on Earth is rarely composed entirely of sand.  A typical desert floor is either composed of a sandy surface interspersed with pebbles and a few larger boulders, or what is known as a desert pavement, where all surface sand and dust have been removed, leaving a layer of interlocking pebbles.\\nThe desert pavement case is irrelevant for our purposes.  In other areas, large pebbles among smaller sand grains will tend to space themselves out evenly, regardless of their initial distribution.  Because of this, the presence of pebbles tends to stabilize a sand sheet, halting saltation by raising z0, the level at which average wind velocity drops to zero.  However, if a sand sheet stabilized by pebbles is subjected to a stronger wind, more sand may be removed, until another equilibrium level is reached where the sand grains are sheltered by the pebbles.\\n\\nA sandy area with large pebbles can sustain a much higher sand flux than a bare sand sheet.  This is due to the tendency of saltating grains to rebound higher and longer when impacting an immobile object such as a pebble.  So when a patch of bare sand forms by deposition or other processes, the tendency will be for upwind saltation to deposit sand on an existing sand patch.  However, a pebbly surface will have a much higher surface roughness than a surface of bare sand, and so the fluid threshold shear velocity will be much higher as well.  So if the shear velocity is not much higher than u*ft for the pebbly surface (a “gentle” wind), the sand patch will be stretched downwind and dispersed.\\n\\nIn the case of a shear velocity much higher than both fluid thresholds (around 4×u*ft, a “strong” wind), saltation will begin in earnest before the wind reaches the sand patch.  At the upwind edge of the sand patch, saltation increases violently, causing substantial drag which causes a reduction in the wind velocity at and just upwind of the bare sand patch, which in turn results in a net deposition of sand.  In this way, a strong wind will serve to increase the thickness of a sand patch, as well as extend it upwind. The same process has been shown to occur in areas where the surface roughness changes more gradually, due to a change in the sand grading.\\n\\nIn order for dunes to form in these areas of changing surface roughness, four conditions must be satisfied.  First, wind which causes saltation along the smoother sand surface must not blow for too long, lest it dissipate the sand accumulation entirely.  Second, for the duration that the strong wind blows, there must be a consistent supply of sand from upstream, or else the smoother sand patch will quickly dissipate in much the same manner.  Third, there must not be a large amount of grains in surface creep, as these grains will tend to encroach upon the smoother patch of sand, preventing dune growth.  Fourth and lastly, the smoother sand must be at least as long as the saturation length, as there will be varying instances of removal and deposition as the new wind profile adjusts.  This saturation length, usually between 4 and 6 meters on earth, represents a lower limit for the size of true sand dunes.\\n\\nThere are two mechanisms by which upwind saltation could be sustained.  The first case we will consider is a unidirectional wind profile, where both strong and gentle winds blow in the same direction (±15º) (Lancaster, 1995).\\nIn a unidirectional wind regime, any sand patches will have no mechanism by which to become wider, and may only extend in the downwind direction.  This leads to the appearance of sand strips, which are arranged parallel to the prevailing wind.  Unless the wind is much higher than the sand’s threshold shear velocity, these sand strips will soon thin out to the point where buried pebbles start to reemerge, in addition to encroaching grains in surface creep.  However, if a period of strong winds occurs, an interesting self-sustaining wind regime may form close to the surface.  The intense saltation ongoing over the sand strips saturates the boundary layer, slowing the near-surface wind velocity significantly.  \\n\\nThe intervening areas between strips are pebbly, and under a gentle wind the higher surface roughness dictates that the near-surface wind velocity will be lower than over the sand strip.  This situation changes in the above case of a very strong wind.  While there may or may not be saltation over the pebbly surface, the density of saltating grains will be less, assuming the wind is not so strong that this area is saturated as well.  This creates alternating streams of slower and faster wind, which tends to create small eddies and vortices, the sum of which is a convergent wind pattern on the sand strips.  This process can be seen in Figure 7.  If the strong wind can be sustained for a long enough time, these sand strips may eventually build into longitudinal dunes, which are arranged parallel to the wind flow.\\n\\nThe second case, where gentle winds blow in a different direction than the stronger winds, is much simpler.  If an isolated sand patch is created, a strong wind will build it up, at the expense of a now-denuded area just downwind.  If gentle winds occur, just barely above the saltation threshold, from a different direction, they will thin out the accumulated pile slightly, but also replenish the denuded area with a fresh layer of sand.  This regime tends to create oblique dunes or transverse dunes, depending on the magnitude of the direction difference.  Oblique dunes are arranged at an angle to the direction of dune propagation, while transverse dunes are perpendicular to the direction of dune propagation.  Regardless of which case occurs, a continuation of strong winds will build a budding dune steadily up to a certain point.  However, when the dune reaches a size where it begins to alter the nearby wind profile, it no longer needs a strong wind to sustain it.  \\n\\nWhen a dune first forms, a cross-section taken parallel to the dune-building wind typically takes a shape similar to the one shown in Figure 8.  Because of the projection of the dune up into the wind stream, the dune significantly alters the wind profile.  Closer streamlines on the upwind or stoss side of the dune show areas of higher wind velocity, indicative of a net positive sand flux, or sand removal.  On the downwind or lee side of the dune, the streamlines spread apart, showing an area of net negative sand flux, or sand deposition.  In this way, a dune can move essentially unaltered across a desert floor, even if the wind is only strong enough to move the bare sand on the dune.\\n \\nFigure 8:  New dune altering the wind profile above itself.  The streamlines appear closer together on the stoss side of the developing dune, and further apart on the lee side, so sand is removed from the front of the dune and deposited downwind, causing dune movement.\\n\\nA sand dune can not remain in this uniform, hill-like profile for long.  Equation 9 gives the sand flux on a simple hill-shaped dune undergoing no net flux (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\n	 	9\\n\\nwhere x is the horizontal distance from the upwind foot of the dune, c is the velocity of the dune, ρs is the density of the sand in bulk (including air between grains), and α is the inclination of the dune surface at point x.  Therefore, all other factors being equal, the both the net removal and deposition of sand will occur at the point where the slope is the steepest, shown in Figure 8.  With an unequal sand flux, different areas of the dune will begin to advance at different rates, leading to an oversteepening of the lee slope as seen in Figure 9.\\n\\nWhen sand is piled on itself, like any granular material, it can only support itself against the force of gravity to a certain point.  Because of frictional and inter-grain cohesive forces, a sand pile can achieve a fairly large angle, typically around 34º for sand on Earth.  Any slope steeper than this angle will collapse, avalanching until the slope below this critical angle, known as the angle of repose.  In the case of a moving dune, sand avalanching in this manner will eventually morph the lee slope into a fairly straight slope just shallower than the angle of repose.  This straight slope is known as a slip face, and is always roughly transverse to the direction of winds above the saltation threshold.\\n\\nWith the formation of the slip face, the lee of the dune now contains a wind shadow, with a surface of discontinuity roughly equal to the surface of the ideal “sand hill” shown in Figure 8.  The wind shadow will serve to increase deposition even further at the foot of the dune, causing dunes with slip faces to continue to grow.  The dune has now reached maturity, and will continue to evolve and migrate as long as there is a consistent wind above the saltation threshold.  \\n\\n===Dune types===\\nThe exact evolution of the dune beyond its initial formation depends upon two factors:  the amount of sand available for saltation outside of the dune, and the wind regime complexity.  The previous descriptions of dunes as, longitudinal, oblique, or transverse refers only to the arrangement of individual dunes in a group in reference to the prevailing wind regime.  These terms have little or no bearing on the actual dune type.  There are three major types of dunes, each of which represents different local conditions, and, most importantly, all of which are found on Mars (Lancaster, 1995).\\n\\nThe first dune type, arguably the easiest to recognize, is the barchan dune.  Barchans form in areas of limited sand availability and unidirectional wind regimes.  The stoss side of the dune is relatively featureless and dome-shaped.  The slip face is curved, resembling a bite which has been taken out of a dome-shaped dune, terminating with two horns extending downwind, one on each side of the dune.\\n\\nNow, the curved slip face is not an indication of changing wind directions.  It is a consequence of the change in sand-wind interaction as the dune grows.  A larger dune begins to interrupt the linear fluid flow, causing it to curve slightly around both sides of the dune.  Since the local wind speed is the most important factor in determining the slip-face orientation, this slight curvature of the horizontal wind profile causes the slip-face to become curved (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\nFigure 10 shows a very neat example of a Martian barchan dune.  This dune exists near 41.4°S 44.6°E, on the western rim of Hellas Basin, the largest impact crater on Mars, and is part of a chain of barchans not seen to the lower left and upper right.  In this image, by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE imager, all the classic barchan features are visible.  The curved, crescent-shaped slip face is prominently featured in the center, dissipating into two “horns” downwind.  The remainder of the dome-shaped dune is covered in sand ripples, which tend to form on barchans due to their unidirectional wind environment.  The dune-forming wind is from ENE-to-WSW, and the ground outside of the dune is a jumbled bedrock terrain, distributed with small sand deposits, suggesting very limited sand availability.  The dune is about 120 m long from stoss foot to horn tip, with the horn-to-horn distance of about 40 m, fairly typical of large barchans found on Earth.\\n\\nThe barchan is one type of the larger group of crescentic dunes, all of which are formed under unidirectional wind regimes.  Another type of crescentic dunes is very closely related, crescentic ridges (not actual ridges, but a type of dune).  Crescentic ridges resemble parallel chains of barchan dunes which tend to overlap.  Logically, crescentic ridges form in areas where sand availability is higher than with pure barchans, but the wind regime is still unidirectional (Lancaster, 1995).  \\n\\nOn earth, the most common type of dune is the linear dune.  However, on Mars, linear dunes only appear to be dominant in about 5% of large dune fields (Hayward et al., 2007).  Linear dunes appear when there are two dominant sand-moving directions, separated by more than 15º. (Lancaster, 1995)  The slip face is not fixed with respect to a linear dune, but shifts from one side of the crest to the other as the wind regime changes.  A related dune type which has also been found on Mars is the reversing dune, which is formed by a wind regime which periodically changes direction close to 180º.\\n\\nAn even more complicated wind regime, featuring three or more prominent wind directions, results in the formation of star dunes.  These can be the largest dunes, building to several hundred meters high on Earth.  These dunes have multiple slip faces, which are active and inactive depending on the current direction of the wind.  On Mars, they are often found on the floor of smaller craters such as Victoria Crater.\\n\\n==Expected nature of sand-surface interaction on Mars==\\n\\n===Martian weather and climate===\\nMars has long been theorized to have an active atmosphere, possessing many of the familiar transient atmospheric characteristics which we on Earth call “weather”.  As early as 1877, Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli observed what he thought were “clouds” in the Martian sky (Parteli, 2007).  While it is almost certain that what he observed were dust storms which cover the surface of Mars every year or so, it began the race to determine just how “alive” the Martian atmosphere currently is.\\n\\nMariner 9 offered the first up-close look at the planet and its atmosphere in 1971.  Imagery at Mariner 9’s arrival indicated that Mars was in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm, obscuring the surface to the point that the striking polar ice caps were not even visible (Parteli, 2007).\\n\\nAfter a few weeks, the dust storm cleared, allowing for the first clear, high-resolution images of the Martian surface.  These images clearly showed large expanses of dune fields on all corners of the planet.  This spurred theories of an active atmosphere with ongoing sand movement.\\n\\nFive years later, the Viking landers reached the surface of Mars, taking the first direct measurements of wind speed in an extraterrestrial environment.  They measured a mean wind speed which rarely exceeded 10 m/s, which corresponds to a wind shear velocity of approximately 0.8 m/s, assuming several theoretical values are correct (Moore, 1985).  These wind measurements were only taken at one height (1.6 m), so the typical wind profile on Mars could still only be estimated.\\n\\nThere were several significant dust storms during the Viking missions, each of which was associated with a peak in wind speeds to 20 m/s or more.  In at least one case, the wind reached 40-50 m/s (wind shear velocity 3-4 m/s) for a period of around 40 seconds at the Viking 1 lander, causing the first observed saltation event on Mars.\\n\\nThe Pathfinder rover, Sojourner, contained instruments to gather this missing data.  The Pathfinder landing site (19.33 N, 33.55 W) was not far from the Viking 1 site (22.697° N latitude and 48.222° W longitude), and in an area of similar surface composition (Sullivan, 2002).  Sojourner  featured a meteorological boom with three wind socks, which was to help fill in the missing data.  Unfortunately for the meteorological goals of the mission (although probably fortunately for the mission in general), the weather was calm for the entire 83 Martian-day mission, with the wind never climbing above 10 m/s at the 1 meter elevation, and no observed sand or dust movement (Sullivan et al., 2000; Sullivan 2002).  There was enough data to estimate a fluid threshold shear velocity of 4.5 m/s, much higher than the numerically and experimentally predicted value of 2.0-2.5 m/s, likely due to the abundance of boulders and large rocks (Sullivan, 2002).\\n\\nThus it is expected that the average weather on Mars is relatively calm.  However, during dust storms, it appears that winds above the saltation threshold can occur, and have occurred in the past.  These planet-wide dust storms occur almost every year in the Martian northern-hemisphere autumn, and likely happen with such repetition because the atmospheric pressure is highest at that time (Larsen et al., 2002).\\n\\nTemperature at the surface has only a minor influence on saltation, aside from possibly preventing it in the case where water or CO2 frost accumulates.  Temperature has been found to vary widely with season, latitude, and time of day, just as on Earth, but typically is in the range of 180-260 K (-135ºF to 10ºF) in the summer and 160-200 K (-170ºF to -100ºF) in the winter.\\n\\n===Global distribution of sand dunes and sheets on Mars===\\nAlthough aeolian processes are ubiquitous on Mars, large-scale sand sheets/seas, dune fields and ergs are not as extensive on Mars as on Earth.  A recent estimate of the coverage of large-scale sand features (dune fields and sand sheets) on Mars is on the order of 800,000 km2, or about 1% of the Martian surface surveyed in that study (Hayward et al., 2007).  On Earth, large-scale sand features cover approximately 5,000,000 km2, and while this is 1.0% of the Earth’s total surface area, it is 3.4% of Earth’s land area.\\n\\nOn Mars, dunes are found almost exclusively within craters and Valles Marineris, the 4000 km-long canyon system near the planet’s equator.  While on Earth most dunes are linear in nature, on Mars a vast majority of dunes are crescentic, with a smaller amount being linear (Hayward et al., 2007).  Large dune fields feature very few star dunes; however, smaller dune fields in medium-sized craters almost universally have a star-like appearance.\\n\\nAs aeolian processes seem to be the only active geological processes on Mars, aside from impact craters and very localized water action, the lower concentration of dunes compared to Earth suggests that there is less sand available for saltation, either because winds above the saltation threshold are less prevalent or there is less total sand on Mars.  Indeed, it may be a combination of the two.  The main source of erosion which produces sand-sized particles on Earth is oceans and other hydrological processes; these are obviously absent from present-day Mars.  On top of that, evidence for present-day winds above the saltation threshold is very sparse.  Prior to the landing of the Mars Exploration Rovers, there has only been one verified instance of indirectly observed saltation on Mars, during the (Viking 1) Martian Dust Storm of Sol 1742 (Moore, 1985).\\n\\n===Properties of the surface and atmosphere at Meridiani Planum===\\nWhile the initial scope of this study was a planet-wide search for dune movement, eventually the search for directly-observed movement of sand moved to Meridiani Planum, in the area around Victoria Crater, where Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has been aggressively imaging the landscape.  \\n\\nWind data is sparse for the Martian surface.  Only three landers have succeeded in making wind measurements, and only the two Viking landers have a data set more than a few months long.  However, these data sets agreed that the shear velocity rarely exceeds 1.0 m/s, and only dust storms contain winds strong enough to produce saltation. This is much lower than u*ft, which is estimated to be approximately 2.0 m/s at Meridiani Planum (Sullivan et al., 2005).\\nFor the area of Meridiani Planum, as with most of the surface of Mars, the sand is composed of basaltic sandstone.   The grains are approximately 50-150µm in diameter, topped by a scattering of pebbles as large as a few millimeters.  The density of grains has been estimated as approximately 3200 kg/m3 (Sullivan et al., 2005).\\n\\nLike Earth, the wind is rarely dead calm on Mars.  This is apparent from wind speed measurements by both Viking landers and Sojourner rover, which were typically less than 10 m/s (22 mph), but were rarely dead calm.  At Meridiani Planum, prevailing winds during apparently calm weather gradually removed dust from Opportunity’s solar panels over a period of 50 Martian days in the summer of 2006.\\n\\n===Expectations for sand dune movement on Mars===\\nMany studies have attempted to find conclusive evidence of sand movement on Mars.  It is apparent that dunes are either migrating very slowly now, or have migrated in the recent past.  There are two main bodies of evidence which support this:  first, there are very few known impact craters on dunes, and second, most Martian dunes appear crisp, with well-defined slip faces.  Studies have estimated that, if sand movement does occur, it is at a rate of 1-8 cm per year at most (Fenton, 2006).\\n\\nDune fields at Rabe Crater (44 ºS, 35ºE) and Proctor Crater (48ºS, 30ºE) have shown strong evidence for dune movement.  Images of Rabe Crater dunes show alternating dark and light streaks on the dunes’ slip faces which change even over the course of a single Martian year, which have been interpreted as saltation-induced grainflows (Fenton, 2006).  Images of Proctor Crater dunes indicate possible slip face reversing on barchanoid dunes (Fenton et al., 2005).  There is even a suggestion in this study that one slip face moved as much as 37 m, however, no study has yet succeeded in directly imaging a large-scale change in dune positions, which would confirm dune migration.\\n\\n==Observation techniques==\\n\\n===History of early observations of Mars===\\nMars is a prominent visible feature in the night sky.  At its closest approach to Earth, it is the 4th brightest object in the night sky, and one of the only visible objects to be bright red.  As such, it has been observed since man first gazed upward, and was recorded by many ancient civilizations as a star signifying war or death.  Until the 17th century, however, it was merely a mote of red light, varying in brightness over the period of a few years.\\n\\nThe first observations of recognizable features on the planet’s surface are attributable to Christiaan Huygens, who sketched a dark plain now known as Syrtis Major, as well as the bright southern polar ice cap, in 1672.  In the same year, Giovanni Domenico Cassini observed a transit of a small star by Mars, and concluded that it must have a very thick atmosphere; although it turned out that his observations were flawed, this was the first “evidence” of a dynamic Martian atmosphere.  In the early 18th century, Giacomo Filippo Maraldi drew what he thought were clouds stretched across the planet, though these turned out to be permanent features of the planets surface which are still visible today.  He also described changes he observed in the southern ice cap, and suggested that the properties of the surface there changed somehow from year to year (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nIn 1783, William Herschel observed another Martian transit and concluded that Cassini’s observations of a very thick Martian atmosphere were false.  However, he also observed what he called “occasional changes of partial bright belts”, concluding they were storm clouds above the planet.  As the few clouds known to exist on Mars are not visible even today from Earth, Herschel likely was observing local dust storms.  In the 1820s and 1830s, Johann Heinrich Mädler and Wilhelm Beer made many contributions to the study of Mars, conclusively proving that the previously observed dark patches were permanent surface features, and determining the planet’s rotational period to within a few seconds.  In 1837 they observed that Mars was nearly featureless save the ice caps, possibly indicating the first observation of a planet-wide dust storm.  In 1864, Rev. William Rutter Dawes improved greatly upon Mädler and Beer’s observations, making drawings depicting almost every major albedo feature identified today (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nAt this point, there was little more that could be learned from earth-bound telescopes, given the limitations imposed by atmospheric aberrations.  In fact, further refinement of observations, more often than not, were completely wrong.  In the 1870’s, Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli first made the infamous claims of canali, Italian for “canals” or “channels”, on the surface of Mars.  As it turned out, the “channels” were either illusions due to optical effects, or simply imagined features (Sheehan, 1996).  Until the 1960s, the prominent theory was that the dark albedo features on Mars were swaths of vegetation, and the ice caps were seasonal patches of water-ice (Sheehan, 1996).  There were observations of yellow clouds, thought to be dust storms, and white clouds, thought to be analogous to earthbound clouds.  There was even a scientific consensus that many dark features were blue in color (Sagan and Kellogg 1963).\\n\\nHowever, there were some doubters to the scientific consensus.  Some theorized a desert-like planet with large dune fields and no vegetation.  As early as the 1950s the idea of a Martian surface dominated by sand dunes was proposed (Gifford, 1964).  A few scientists also doubted the existence of the canali as anything more than mere optical illusions.\\n\\n===Observations from Martian probes===\\nThose doubters were proven right by the observations of Mariner 4 in 1965.  Sending spacecraft to Mars was no small task—several probes launched by both Russia and the United States failed to reach Mars successfully in early 1963 and mid-1965.  Mariner 4 performed the first successful fly-by of Mars in July, 1965.  It was only able to take 22 discontinuous, low-resolution, blurry images, but they were sufficient to reveal that the traditional view of Mars’s atmosphere was quite wrong.  The images taken by the television camera revealed an old, dry, cratered surface, with no canals, no vegetation, and no evidence of life whatsoever.  Indeed, it looked closer in appearance to the moon than to Earth.  To further disprove the contemporary theories, atmospheric measurements indicated that the surface pressure was at most a few millibars, and was composed almost entirely of carbon dioxide (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nIt was at this time that the idea of dust storms as the main form of weather on the planet first rose to prominence.  It was the only plausible explanation for the seasonal changes in albedo features, with the idea of liquid water and vegetation now all but debunked.  The images were not nearly detailed enough to image sand dunes, however, it was widely believed that the atmospheric dust was lifted by surface sand movement and saltation impacts (Goody, 1969).\\n\\nThe next probes sent to Mars, Mariner 6 and Mariner 7, would add detail to the planets surface (high-resolution imagery of about 10% of the planet’s surface), and confirm the atmospheric measurements made by Mariner 4.  By chance, they photographed no dust storms or dune fields, especially because only a few dozen images from these two probes were of high enough resolution.  However, they did capture images of frost in craters, as well as confirm that the ice caps were likely CO2 ice (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nThe next successful mission, Mariner 9, was also the first successful Mars orbiter.  In fall of 1971, it began returning images of a planet completely devoid of surface features.  After shutting down for a month to conserve power, it began returning images rich in detail, including craters, valleys, and, most importantly, sand dunes.  Mariner 9 was able to image most of the surface down to a resolution of 100 meters or so.  \\n\\nSince then, the resolution of images sent back from Mars has steadily improved.  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Viking orbiters imaged much of the planet down to a resolution of 40-90 meters, with many areas of interest imaged as well as 10-meter resolution.  The next Mars orbiter, the Mars Global Surveyor, arrived almost 20 years later in 1997.  It’s Mars Orbiter Camera imaged about 70% of the planet to better than 7-meter resolution in almost 10 years orbiting Mars.  Finally, the current Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera is imaging areas of interest with a resolution of 25-50 centimeters.\\n\\n11.	References\\n*Alghamdi, A. A. A. and Akyurt, M.

The French Revolution was a true revolution due to the fact that it follows many of the steps necessary to be called a revolution.  One step that should be mentioned is that the public was willing to use violence in order to protect the Third Estate.   This is significant due to the fact that the Third Estate is able to make the changes to the government that people want.  This is shown in the Storming of Bastille where revolutionists broke into the fortress in order to seize gunpowder and weapons.  In Addition, this act convinced King Louis XVI to withdraw his troops from Paris.   Withdrawing his troops showed that he was intimidated by the people, a major step in a revolution.  This also shows the weakness of the French government, which makes the people confident in a revolution.  This step leads to many different steps needed to revolutionize a country. ~tony's

Linguistics, like other academic fields, contains individuals with many passionate opinions on the nature and theory of language.  Wikipedia should not be a soapbox for the advocacy of a particular theory.  However, I think it is important to present all existing theories so that people can make up their minds for themselves.  It becomes tedious and cluttery in Wikipedia to present every theory on a topic with its own list of pros and cons, however sometimes it is important to understand the line of reasoning in which a theory is discredited in the gradual evolution of scientific knowledge.\\n<br />\\nWikipedia has become the symbol of the 21st century age of information.  In milliseconds a vast medium of free information is available to everyone.  I want to contribute to wikipedia and participate in its gradual expansion.
As a physicist and chemical engineer, my scientific loyalties sometimes conflict with my spiritual loyalties.   As a philosopher, seeking eternal, universal truths, my discoveries are being chronicled in a book which I call, True Freedom, which finds much resonance with Ayn Rand's Objectivism and Individualism.\\n\\nTrue Freedom requires individual equality, lest one person or group infringe upon the freedoms of others.  Therefore privacy establishes impartiality and fairness.  Privacy protects individuals from inequality by restricting the ability to discern and thus segregate individuals or groups by any particular characteristic.  Security requires that every person be uniquely, positively, and easily identified so that trust may abound and privacy may be most fully preserved.  True Democracy extends equality by allowing every citizen an equal voice in matters of governance (that there may be no masters or tyrants).
A large proportion of homes include traditional radiators for heating, which over the years, have been mainly left uncovered, but due to growing demand and the awareness caused by exposure on TV shows, radiator cabinets have changed from an upmarket fashion accessory to an essential item in the home. Providing effective protection against coming into contact with hot surfaces is important for all members of the family, especially the young and elderly. Adding covers eliminates the likelihood of this occurring whilst creating attractive room features throughout the home. An ever increasing selection of cabinets in a variety of styles and finishes is available nationwide in standard sizes to cover the majority of UK radiators and adjustable versions are also available. These are designed to fit a number of different sized radiators by adjusting in width to provide a custom made look. With special made to measure services ensuring non-standard radiators can also be covered, homeowners will welcome the safety and aesthetic benefits of adding radiator cabinet.
\\n<big>DATA BSE</big>\\n                       A database is an organized collection of data for one or more purposes, usually in digital form. The data are typically organized to model relevant aspects of reality (for example, the availability of rooms in hotels), in a way that supports processes requiring this information (for example, finding a hotel with vacancies). This definition is very general, and is independent of the technology used.\\nThe term "database" may be narrowed to specify particular aspects of organized collection of data and may refer to the logical database, to physical database as data content incomputer data storage or to many other database sub-definitions.\\nThe term database is correctly applied to the data and their supporting data structures, and not to the database management system (referred to by the acronym DBMS). The database data collection with DBMS is called a database system.\\nThe term database system implies that the data is managed to some level of quality (measured in terms of accuracy, availability, usability, and resilience) and this in turn often implies the use of a general-purpose database management system (DBMS).[1] A general-purpose DBMS is typically a complex software system that meets many usage requirements, and the databases that it maintains are often large and complex. The utilization of databases is now spread to such a wide degree that virtually every technology and product relies on databases and DBMSs for its development and commercialization, or even may have such embedded in it. Also, organizations and companies, from small to large, heavily depend on databases for their operations.
{{failed}}\\n\\nAmong those who have spent significant amounts of time editing on Wikipedia are those who have had the misfortune of dealing with Administrators who have gone far beyond their administrative role of applying Wikipedia policy and respecting consensus, and have granted themselves authority to dictate Wikipedia policy as they see fit, regardless of consensus. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. With current Wikipedia policy giving admins a lifetime sinecure, and the only means of disciplining admins in the hands of their fellow admins, there is no effective control over those who have exceeded their authority.\\n\\nWhile other reforms are desperately needed, the key proposal suggested here is to limit administrators to a renewable one-year term of office requiring renewal by a supermajority of Wikipedia editors. While there is much damage that can be done in twelve months, the threat of loss of their administrative powers will play a much-needed role in ensuring that administrators recognize their limitations in exercising the extensive powers they have been granted.\\n\\n[[Category:Wikipedia adminship]]

'''<big>BLAST INJURIES</big>'''\\n\\n\\n'''WHY ARE BLAST INJURIES AN IMPORTANT ISSUE RIGHT NOW?'''\\n\\nAmerica's armed forces are sustaining attacks from explosions or blast by rocket-propelled grenades, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and land mines almost daily in deployed settings. Civilian workers and military personnel working in these combat zones are at increased risk of blast-related trauma, particularly blast-related traumatic brain injury (TBI). \\n\\nSome of the TBI and concussive injuries associated with significant blast may not be identified acutely for several reasons. Initially, the blast-related TBI or concussion may have occur simultaneously with other more obvious life threatening injuries. Initially, the focus of medical care providers must be on the most life threatening injuries. Sometimes, in the case of a concussion/mild TBI (mTBI) resulting from blast, there may be no outward sign of injury; service members may also be reluctant to endorse acute symptoms because they do not want to be medically evacuated and separated from their unit. Because blast exposure is so common in the combat zones and almost everyone has had some of the acute symptoms of concussion, it may not be identified as problematic until the service member returns home from the deployment. \\n\\nFinally, concussions and TBI related to significant blast exposure are also likely to have other important co-morbid conditions present. For example, the patient may also have combat stress or depression associated with a return from deployment; it is very challenging for the medical providers in these situations to determine what symptoms are due to the concussion and which symptoms are due to the combat stress or depression. \\n\\n'''HOW DOES BLAST EXPOSURE CAUSE A CONCUSSION OR A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY?'''\\n\\nA TBI is caused by a blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the function of the brain. Exposure to blast events can affect the body in a number of ways; in addition, these different injuries mechanisms can interact and result in more impairments or prolonged periods of recovery.\\nPrimary blast injury is the result of exposure to the over pressurization wave or the complex pressure wave that is generated by the blast itself. This blast over-pressurization wave travels at a high velocity and is affected by the surrounding environment; for example, the effects of the blast wave may be increased in a closed environment such as a vehicle. Air-filled organs such as the ear, lung, and gastrointestinal tract and organs surrounded by fluid-filled cavities such as the brain and spinal cord are especially susceptible to primary blast injury (Elsayed, 1997; Mayorga, 1997). The over pressurization wave dissipates quickly, causing the greatest risk of injury to those closest to the explosion.\\nSecondary blast injury is the result of energized fragments flying through the air; these fragments may cause penetrating brain injury.\\nTertiary blast injury may occur when the individual is thrown from the blast into a solid object such as a adjacent wall or even a steering wheel. These types of injuries are associated with acceleration/ deceleration forces and blunt force trauma to the brain similar to that observed following high speed motor vehicle accidents.\\nFinally, quaternary blast injury can occur in the presence of severe blast related trauma resulting from significant blood loss associated with traumatic amputations or even from inhalation of toxic gases resulting from the explosion.\\nIn summary, TBI resulting from blast exposure can be much more complex compared to TBI from other causes. As such, it is challenging to differentiate blast related TBI and/or concussion from other conditions. Finally, it is also difficult to estimate the course of recovery in these cases, as it may vary widely depending on various types of blast injury and other injury variables, such as the size of the blast, distance from the blast, etc. Because of these issues, it may be difficult to assess blast related TBI and concussion in the same manner that other brain injuries are examined. A better approach may be to conduct an evaluation based on the mechanism (cause) of the injury; that is, screen all individual service members exposed to a blast for any symptoms which might be resulting from the effects of blast on the brain. \\n\\n'''WHAT SYMPTOMS MAY INDICATE A BLAST RELATED BRAIN INJURY?'''\\n\\nDifficulties experienced as a result of a closed brain blast injury may include a range of physical, emotional, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Many of these symptoms are non-specific, however; that is they occur with other conditions such as depression or combat stress. It requires an experience clinician who is familiar with the many variables involved in blast injury and has an understanding of how these variables can affect recovery and ultimately impact return to everyday activities.\\n\\n'''WHAT IS DVBIC DOING TO CARE FOR THOSE WITH BLAST INJURIES?'''\\n\\nDVBIC works to identify all service members who have sustained a closed brain injury during combat operations and to ensure that they receive the best care available. \\n\\nBecause the effects of blast injury on the brain are still being discovered, DVBIC has led the way in developing a number of important research projects examining specific variables involved in the blast. In addition, DVBIC has been involved in studies on developing combat gear which will better protect the brain should a blast occur. \\n\\nFinally, DVBIC has been involved in the validation of several important diagnostic tests for better identifying the blast effects on the brain; these include the use of advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as Diffuse Tensor-weighted Imaging (DTI) and advanced technologies for measuring the function of the brain as the individual works on specific tasks; this technique is known as Magnetoencephalography (MEG).\\n\\n<ref>{{cite web|title=BLAST INJURIES|url=http://www.dvbic.org/TBI---The-Military/Blast-Injuries.aspx|publisher=http://www.dvbic.org|accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref>
'''Non Deliverable Forwards:'''''[[Italic text]]''\\n\\nThe standard FX transaction was designed to facilitate the exchange of notional currencies for the purpose of cross-border commerce.  The standard FX forward transaction allows for parties to the transaction to agree a rate of exchange days, weeks, months or even years in advance of the actual transaction occurring.  The use of these transactions has evolved from its original purpose.  FX transactions are commonly used to hedge exposure to exchange rate risk.  An example of such use would be a manufacturing company making a product in Europe and selling the product in the United States.  Such an organisation would have expenditure (plant, machinery, salary etc.) in Euros and revenue (from the sales of its product) in US Dollars.  If the value of the Euro against the US Dollar increases, the cost base, relative to revenues, would increase, resulting in less profit.  Conversely, the company would become more profitable if the value of the US Dollar increased against the Euro.  To hedge against fluctuations in the exchange rate, the company might enter into a forward FX contract to sell US Dollars against Euros at the end of its fiscal year.  If the value of the Euro increased against the US Dollar, the core business of the company would be less profitable.  However, the value of the FX contract would increase and the profit from this transaction would offset the reduction in profitability.\\n\\nThis hedging strategy works well if currency exchange between the two counties is unrestricted.  However, when exchange controls are in place, the strategy becomes less effective.  This is particularly true in countries where the exchange controls either forbid, or heavily penalise large cross-border cash transfers.  The Non-Deliverable Forward transaction was designed to overcome some of the problems of exchange controls by eliminating the need for cross-border cash transfers without eliminating the risk profile (and hence the hedge effectiveness) of the transaction.
== salt water crockdile ==\\n\\nSaltwater crocodiles are extremely dangerous animals, but data on attacks are limited outside of Australia, and estimates of human fatalities vary wildly between dozens to thousands annually. It is likely that, given this species' low population within most of its non-Australian / New Guinean range, the number of attacks is probably within the lower range of estimates. Most attacks by adult "salties" are fatal, given the animals' size and strength. In Australia, attacks are rare and usually make headlines when they do occur. There are, on average, no more than one or two fatal attacks reported per year in the country.[25] The low level of attacks is most likely due to the extensive effort by local wildlife officials to post crocodile warning signs at nearly every billabong, river, lake and even at some beaches and also due to the relatively well-informed nature of the local citizens. In the Aboriginal community of Arnhem Land, which occupies roughly half of the top end of the Northern Territory, attacks may go unreported and may be more common. There have also been recent, less-publicized attacks in Borneo,[26] Sumatra,[27] eastern India,[28] and in Myanmar.[29]\\nthere are two types of crockadile a fresh one and a salt water one.\\n\\n== chembackolie ==\\n\\nchemabackolie is in ammrica and the wheather is monsoon sun
Farmland Flooding in Northeast South Dakota (Brown County)\\n\\nThe weekend of May 5-6, 2007 brought heavy rainfall throughout South Dakota.  Northeast of Aberdeen, Columbia, SD received nine inches of precipitation in one shot.\\nMuch of this area was in need of rain, with the previous summer’s near drought conditions.  (June and July 2006 had less than an inch of rain in the same area.)  The heavy rains caused flooding throughout the county.  There were flooded basements, closed (flooded) roads, and school delays because of the heavy rains.  This also caused many problems for area farmers.  Some crops that had already been planted were now washed away or flooded out.  Replanted crops face maturity problems because of fall frost.  Even though most would never frown upon rain, it has created new problems and challenges to face.  \\n\\n[[User:Caradennert|Cara Dennert]] 23:20, 24 June 2007 (UTC)
'''Background'''\\n\\nNowadays, the problems of climate changing and global warming become more and more serious, numbers of countries have implemented carbon taxes or energy taxes that are related to carbon dioxide emission in order to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and thereby reduce the speed of global warming. In Europe, numbers countries, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Italy, Switzerland, and the UK have imposed energy taxes based on carbon content. More surprisingly, in the most powerful manufacturers’ country, China Daily (2010) stated that the Chinese government has proposed to introduce a carbon tax from 2012 or 2013. According to Australian government (2011), Australia is one of the top carbon dioxide emission countries which produce 500million tones of carbon pollution each year. \\nA carbon tax is also called as a price instrument, since it sets a price for carbon dioxide emissions. In economic aspect, the carbon dioxide pollution is considered as negative externality, a negative effect on a party not directly involved in a transaction, which results in a market failure. A tax on a negative externality is called a Pigovian tax which should be equal to marginal damage costs. \\nAustralian carbon tax is a tax on energy sources which charging based on the amount of emission level. It can be implemented by taxing the burning of fossil fuels. The carbon tax involved in producing a product would start to be factored into its final price. Moreover, Australia government plans to use the tax income to investing clean energy. In the future, the carbon tax will simulate the pollution-intensive companies to use other clean production processes in order to reduce their emission and lower their costs.\\n\\n'''Impact on mining'''\\n\\nWhile the Australian Government sees great benefit from the carbon tax, in the mining community, a very different view exists. Unsustainable increases in operating costs could lead to the closure of many mines and thus mass job losses, while businesses which rely on the mining of resources such as airlines could be forced to use cheaper alternatives, thus reducing the required output from these mines. \\nThe introduction of the tax would ‘hinder Australian mining’s ability to operate in the world market’ (Mineral council of Australia 2011). It is estimated that by 2020 the Australian mining industry will have paid between 18 - 25 billion dollars in tax, meaning that Australia’s industry will be at a disadvantage in the world market. This common concern amongst the Australian mining industry is highlighted by the fact that in Europe 73% of all mining exporters are subsidised by the government while only 16% would be in Australia under the carbon tax. The mining industry in Australia already has to compete with mining industries overseas, namely Indonesia, Columbia and China. These countries have significantly cheaper operating costs than Australia ($34 to lift one tone of coal opposed to $42 in Australia), mainly due to the substandard working conditions that exist in these countries. \\n\\nThe Australian Coal Association’s chairman, John Pegler, believes that 17% of all black coal mines in Australia will close putting ‘at risk more than 21000 jobs in the next ten years’ as a consequence of the carbon tax. The ‘economic deadweight cost’ (Marius Kloppers, BHP Billiton’s CEO 2011) will be too large for the smaller mining companies to absorb, forcing the closure of these mines. This ultimately could mean that a monopoly will begin to exist within the mining industry, with larger companies such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto becoming the only mining operators in Australia.\\n\\n'''Political impact'''\\n\\nThe carbon tax has received heavy criticism from opposing parties. One of the major criticisms of the proposed plan is that it will increase inflation. Treasury modelling suggests that household cost will increase by an average of $9.90 per week as a result of the tax. This is because polluters are expected to pass on the cost to consumers. The demand for services such as electricity is said to be relatively inelastic. This means that there aren’t any good substitutes for this service which in turn allows firms to increases prices freely. Therefore, the tax could essentially become politically unsustainable.  Since the tax is linked to the production of goods and services such as electricity, which the consumer cannot live without, there will be constant political pressure on the government to remove the tax. \\n\\nThe labour government is convinced that the carbon tax will work successfully in achieving its aims of lowering greenhouse gases and promoting green energy. The government believes in the concept of climate change, which was a contributing factor towards their decision of developing of this policy. Australian’s are the highest per capita polluters in the developed world, so it does make sense that Australia should join the ranks of other countries such as France and Denmark in introducing a carbon tax. However, the question remains as to weather such a tax will reduce pollution. There are no guarantees that emissions will decline if consumption of the goods and services that produce carbon emissions remains unresponsive to price increases. \\n\\nThe liberal government knows that climate change has not been proven, and that studies are still sketchy. Therefore, their approach has been to adopt the stance of not believing in climate change and going against the carbon tax policy. This could be a clever tactic if the policy is proven to be ineffective after its implementation. \\nThe carbon tax has without a doubt been a huge talking point within Australia and its potential success is crucial to the survival of the labor government.
Sustainable Cleaning\\n\\nIn the 1980’s the United Nations created a commission title the UN Decade for Education for Sustainable Development in response to a growing realization of the need to balance economic and social progress with the concerns for the environment.  The Commission defined sustainable development in the publication as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. \\n\\n\\nPeople and corporations need to be responsible and do the right thing when it comes to protecting our earth.  There are many factors that can help contribute to sustainability, but the one discussed here is chemicals.  Each year, millions of tons of carcinogens are washed down drains.  Harsh chemicals in cleaning products often contain chemicals that have adverse effects on the environment.  In addition to negative effects on the environment, chemical cleaning products also have health effects on those that work with them on a daily basis or are exposed to them in the workplace.  \\n\\n\\n"Green chemicals" started to show up in the marketplace in the late 1980's.  However, during the introduction stages of these types of products, many companies purchased these chemicals at premium prices only to learn that they did not work.  Recently with improvements in technology and a better understanding of customer needs, several companies have began to develop cleaning products that work, are priced right, and are better for the environment and human health.  Today, many businesses are beginning to use sustainable cleaning chemicals to clean their facilities.  Employees, workers, and customers were demanding it.  But, with so many products out there to choose from, how do you know which ones to pick?\\n\\n\\nWhile Green Seal and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Design for the Environment (DfE) program are a good benchmark, they should not be the only consideration if you are selecting green cleaning products.  One item that may be helpful to remember that certifications are based on a process that can take a long time to complete.  Therefore, while these certifications are relevant, they may not be the most up-to-date source of information in "green" chemicals.  Some other helpful tips might include reviewing the ingredients in the product.  Are they made from naturally derived ingredients like sugar, surfactants, citrus, milk and soybeans?  Natural ingredients in products are effective cleaners and are more sustainable for human health and the environment.  Another tip is looking at the company supplying the product.  What is their commitment to Sustainability and how long have they been manufacturing the product?\\n\\n\\nAn innovator in this space is a company called Coastwide Laboratories, a regional distributor located in the Pacific Northwest.  Coastwide began looking into this area in the early 1980's.  Chief Science Officer, Roger McFadden reviewed several products and found various harmful ingredients such as volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde, and carcinogens in the products.  McFadden recognized the danger in these chemicals and developed the Sustainable Cleaning Product Design Standard (SEGC-114) in which all products developed by the manufacturer must comply with.  In addition, the company developed a “green gatekeeper” policy that made sure that cleaning chemicals that they distribute also meet their sustainability requirements.  \\n\\n\\nMcFadden developed the Sustainable Earth® product line is 2003.

Introduction\\n\\nDifferential equations arise in many areas of science and technology; whenever a deterministic relationship involving some continuously changing quantities (modeled by functions) and their rates of change (expressed as derivatives) is known or postulated. This is well illustrated by classical mechanics, where the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time varies. Newton's Laws allow one to relate the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body and state this relation as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time. In many cases, this differential equation may be solved, yielding the law of motion.\\n\\nDifferential equations are mathematically studied from several different perspectives, mostly concerned with their solutions, functions that make the equation hold true. Only the simplest differential equations admit solutions given by explicit formulas. Many properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without finding their exact form. If a self-contained formula for the solution is not available, the solution may be numerically approximated using computers. The theory of dynamical systems puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations, while many numerical methods have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy.

== assassin ==\\n\\na murderer, one who kills a person for fanatical,financial or monetary reasons.\\n\\n\\n:history:\\n\\nActive in Persia and Syria from the 8th to 14th centuries, the original Assassins were members of the Nizaris, a Muslim group who opposed the Abbasid caliphate with threats of sudden assassination by their secret agents. Other populations of the area regarded the Nizaris as unorthodox outcasts, and from this attitude came one of the names for the group, ḥaššāšīn, a word originally meaning "hashish users," which had become a general term of abuse. Reliable sources offer no evidence of hashish use by Nizari agents, but sensationalistic stories of murderous, drug-crazed ḥaššāšīn or Assassins were widely repeated in Europe. Marco Polo tells a tale of how young Assassins were given a potion and made to yearn for paradise—their reward for dying in action—by being given a life of pleasure. As the legends spread, the word ḥaššāšīn passed through French or Italian and appeared in English as assassin in the 16th century, already with meanings like "treacherous killer."\\n\\n:modern assassins:\\n\\n\\nIt is clear that assassins have taken a new shape today, using silenced guns, or the cliché knife. But, this idea of assassins derived long before video games and modern depictions. It derived in a time when it was necessary for survival. It was in fact a well-utilized tool to save their country from utter destruction.

For example, when 6.4 scale earthquake hit south-western Pakistan in 2008, several relief operations were conducted by HOPE team consisted of doctors, paramedics, and social workers. HOPE provided food, proof tents, and clothes as well as medical care, and more than 6000 people were stood to benefit.\\n  All these projects of HOPE are under the motto of ‘self-sufficiency’ and ‘sustainability’, which means that the goal of HOPE is to help the community reach sustainable development by achieving self-sufficiency. They try this by largely working in cooperation with Community Based Organizations (CBO’S). CBO’S are often considered more effective in meeting the community’s need and better implementation , which gives more reasons for HOPE to work with CBO’S.

Deforestation : Africa’s deforestation rate is twice that of the world’s. 90% of Africa’s population requires wood to use as fuel for heating and cooking. The rate of illegal logging, which is another main cause of deforestation, varies from country to country, such as 50% in Cameroon and 80% in Liberia. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, deforestation is primarily caused by the needs of the poor, along with unsupervised logging and mining.\\nIn Ethiopia, the main cause is the country’s growing population, which induces an increase in agriculture, livestock production, and fuel wood. Low education and little government intervention also contributes to deforestation. Madagascar’s forest loss is partially caused by citizens using slash-and-burn techniques after independence from the French.\\nNigeria has the highest rate of deforestation of primary forests, according to the FAO. Deforestation in Nigeria is caused by logging, subsistence agriculture, and the collection of wood for fuel. \\nAccording to the FAO, deforestation has wiped out nearly 90% of Africa’s forest. West Africa only has 22.8% of its moist forests left, and 81% of Nigeria’s old-growth forests disappeared within 15 years. Deforestation also lowers the chance of rainfall; Ethiopia has experienced famine and droughts because of this. 98% of Ethiopia’s forests have disappeared over the last 50 years.\\nWithin 43 years, Kenya’s forest coverage decreased from about 10% to 1.7%. Deforestation in Madagascar has also led to desertification, soil loss, and water source degradation, resulting in the country’s inability to provide necessary resources for its growing population. In the last five years, Nigeria lost nearly half of its primary forests. Ethiopia’s government, along with organizations like Farm Africa, is starting to take steps to stop excessive deforestation <ref>{{cite web|title=Deforestation by Region|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_by_region|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>. \\n\\n2.

'''Terrorism – A Global Issue'''\\n\\n----\\n\\n\\n\\nTerrorism is one of the most serious challenges the world faces today. It is war against democracy and crime against humanity. It has crossed national boundaries and has international ramifications. It is a new variant of genocide which threatens national unity and sovereignty. Terrorism in one way is a new threat to humanity in the 21st century. Terrorism is violence used by a few against fellow human beings. Terrorist have total disregard for human lives including their own. Violence is an essential part of terrorism. Terrorism is a systematic use of violence or the threat of violence to achieve specific political goals. It attempts to use violence to cause widespread panic, fear or terror to achieve its ultimate political aim. This fusion of crime and politics gives birth to terrorism. Terrorist use violence to demoralize the government and ultimately push them to a situation of counter violence. In this struggle it is the civilian population which suffers the most – physically, mentally and economically. Terrorism which is confined within the national boundary and is directed against one’s own government is called Insurgency.\\n\\nFew words are as politically or emotionally charged as terrorism. One 1988 study by the US Army found that over 100 definitions of the word "terrorism" have been used. Acts of terrorism are not intended to merely victimize or eliminate those who are killed, injured or taken hostage but rather to intimidate and influence the societies to which they belong. Modern terrorism has come to be defined in part by the influential power of the mass media that terrorists co-opt in their efforts to amplify and broadcast feelings of intense fear and anger. As a type of unconventional warfare, terrorism is designed to weaken or supplant existing political landscapes through capitulation or acquiescence as opposed to subversion or action. “Terrorist attacks" are usually characterized as "indiscriminate", "targeting of civilians" or executed "with disregard for human life". The term "terrorism" is often used to assert that the political violence of an enemy is immoral, wanton and unjustified. According to the most common definition of terrorism typically used by states, academics, counter-terrorism experts and non-governmental organizations, "terrorists" are actors who don't belong to any recognized armed forces or who don't adhere to the laws of war and who are, therefore, regarded as "rogue actors". Those who are accused of being "terrorists" rarely identify themselves as such and, instead, typically use terms that refer to their ideological or ethnic struggle, such as: separatist, freedom fighter, liberator, revolutionary, vigilante, militant, paramilitary, guerrilla, rebel, jihadi or mujaheddin, or fedayeen or any one of similar-meaning words in a number of languages. Terrorism has been used by a broad array of organizations to further their objectives. They including right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic and religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments. \\nTerrorism in the past was found in different places. Terrorism [terrorism] the threat or use of violence, often against the civilian population, to achieve political or social ends, to intimidate opponents, or to publicize grievances. The term dates from the Reign of Terror (1793-94) in the French Revolution but has taken on additional meaning in the 20th cent. Terrorism involves activities such as assassinations, bombings, random killings, and hijackings. Used for political, not military, purposes, and most typically by groups too weak to mount open assaults, it is a modern tool of the alienated, and its psychological impact on the public has increased because of extensive coverage by the media. Political terrorism also may be part of a government campaign to eliminate the opposition, as under Hitler, Mussolini , Stalin , and others, or may be part of a revolutionary effort to overthrow a regime. Terrorist attacks also are now a common tactic in guerrilla warfare. Governments find attacks by terrorist groups difficult to prevent; international agreements to tighten\\nIn the past few decades India has been badly affected by terrorist. Some hostile countries encourage fundamentalist forces, separatist tendencies and terrorism in India. As a result, secularism in India, which is built upon the principle of unity in diversity, gets adversely affected. Terrorism poses a direct threat to national sovereignty, territorial integrity and democracy in India. Some well known terrorist in India are People’s war group (PWG), Maoists communists centre (MCC) and the IKF. The world too has seen many terrorist in the past few years. The whole world has been shaken by the destruction caused by these terrorists. The major terrorist associations are Al-Qaeda and Taliban. Al-Qaeda was a association created by the great Taliban leader Osama Bin Ladein who ruthlessly caused the destruction of the World Trade Centre, Washington D.C on 9th September 2001.  He also crashed an airplane on the Pentagon, USA. \\n\\nAl-Qaeda or Al-Qaida is an armed Sunni Islamic organization with the stated objective of eliminating foreign influence in Muslim countries. The most prominent members of the group are adherents of Wahabism, an extreme, militant sect of Islam. While Osama Bin Ladein is generally recognized as the group’s leader, the group’s operations are not centralized, and many independent and collaborative cells exist in multiple countries linked by a common cause.\\nAs a matter of fact, all sectors are put to a stand still due to these terror strikes. The direct effect of these is seen in the sudden drop in the markets. The stock prices do drop down and the trading comes to a stand still, however the business seldom stops and the markets show their cushioning effect by regaining the vigor. But at times the loss of even trading day can be fatal to a country’s economy. Such attacks also incur a direct burden on the defense budget. It goes without saying that the governments do take desperate measures to minimize the losses and cover the country against the future threats. The new areas of defense research open up and thus fresh jobs are created. This brighter side of the attacks is over-shadowed by the loss of lives and panic that is created with in the country. The government, under such circumstances, looses the track of their priorities and the developmental works are sidelined. This causes damage to civic society. The worst hit by terrorist activities is the third world countries. The terrorists make these vulnerable counties their bases and from here carry out the destructive activities. Their influence in such countries shows and threatens the developed world of their power and dominance. Thus such countries make an appropriate guinea pig. If a terrorists strike a big country or a city, the whole world knows about it. The tragedy with these countries is that their miseries are not broadcasted because of their non connectivity with the rest of the world. They are thus the breeding grounds of terrorism and worst hit areas by this destructive activity. \\nFive years after the 9/11, the main security threat faced by nations is not Al-Qaeda. It is the growing ability of small groups to inflict levels of damage unprecedented in history, and the growing inability of nations to check it. Through history, the state has been powerful and individuals weak. But education and technology have now made small groups powerful enough to threaten or decimate the state. This is true of both Islamic and non-Islamic groups. It is Trans-religious.\\nIRA cadres in Ireland and Basque terrorists in Spain and France are Christian terrorists. The Tamil tigers in Sri Lanka are Hindu terrorists who invented suicide bombing. In the 1970s and 1980s, the JVP in Sri Lanka represented Buddhism. The Aum Shinrikyo killed thousands with nerve gas in Tokyo. Maoists in Nepal represent secular terrorism. So do Indian Maoists who operate in 162 out of 602districts. Islamic terrorists have plenty of company. In the US itself, the Unabomber Kaczynski maimed and killed peopled for 18 years before being caught. The Oklahoma bombers killed 168 people in 1995. After 9/11, envelopes with anthrax were sent to the capitol and other places, causing panic in Washington. \\nDeadly explosives like RDX are available globally through sophisticated black markets, sometimes through the internet. So are Assault rifles, grenades and rockets. Cell phones provide communications that only the most sophisticated armies once had. Throw-away cell phones and changing e-mail address provide enough anonymity to foil the most sophisticated, Powerful intelligence agencies.\\nTo change things there should be understanding between people and the willingness to rise against this form of corruptive disaster. Corruption is another cause for all the terrorist activities. The future looks grim. With advancing technology, small groups will become even more powerful, and the state will become even less capable of stopping them. The state will probably respond by acquiring draconian powers and crushing civil liberties.
Sustainability and development\\nProponents of sustainable development have been trying to reconcile the urgent needs of effective environmental protection and conservation of resources with economic development. While the concept has been politically successful at bringing sustainability into the mainstream, both in developed and developing countries, it remains controversial.[29]\\n\\nThe skeptics have pointed out that infinite economic growth is impossible on a finite planet, and that Earth’s limits also define the limits of all material-based activities. Some contend that the term itself is an oxymoron, creating the impression that humans can "have their cake and eat it too."[30] In reality, sustainable development has tended to mean nothing more than ecologically more sensitive growth — a slightly reformed status quo. Rebuttals involve, on one hand, the claims of expanding carrying capacity through human ingenuity, and on the other hand, a different conception of development.[31]\\n\\nSome of the advocates of sustainable development have argued it is best understood as qualitative improvement. In that case, development means “better” rather than “more” and an emphasis on quality of life, rather than material living standards. They call for better, not faster, lives and for a focus on values, not things. These advocates of a new paradigm urge a movement away from the dogma that the only wealth is material wealth, with the resulting development being recognized formally by an improvement in the quality of life indicators.[32]\\n\\nEnvironmental sustainability is the process of making sure current processes of interaction with the environment are pursued with the idea of keeping the environment as pristine as naturally possible.\\n\\nAn "unsustainable situation" occurs when natural capital (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of environmental degradation is the inability to sustain human life. Such degradation on a global scale could imply extinction for humanity.\\n\\nConsumption of renewable resources State of environment Sustainability \\nMore than nature's ability to replenish Environmental degradation Not sustainable \\nEqual to nature's ability to replenish Environmental equilibrium Steady-state economy \\nLess than nature's ability to replenish Environmental renewal Sustainable development \\n\\n\\n[edit] Human impact on the biosphere\\n \\nLand for nature - Catalonia \\nLand for humans - ChicagoThe Millennium Ecosystem Assessment provides the most comprehensive current synthesis of the state of the Earth’s ecosystems. Natural systems (often referred to as ecosystem services) are humanity's life-support system, providing the necessary conditions for humans to flourish. Over the last 50 years the rapidly escalating and potentially critical nature of human global impact on the biodiversity of these ecosystem services has become the source of major biological concern. [33] [26]\\n\\n\\nAt a fundamental level human impact on the Earth is being manifest through changes in the global biogeochemical cycles of chemicals that are critical to life, most notably those of water, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.\\n\\nThere is now clear scientific evidence that human activity is having a significant effect on all of these cycles.[34]\\n\\n\\nGLOBAL GEOCHEMICAL CYCLES CRITICAL FOR LIFE \\nNitrogen Cycle\\n \\nWater Cycle\\n \\nCarbon Cycle\\n \\nOxygen Cycle\\n \\n\\nPhosphorus cycle\\n \\n\\n\\n[edit] Protecting the biosphere\\nThere are two major ways of reducing human impact on the planet. The first is to monitor and respond to direct human impacts on the oceans and freshwater systems, the land and atmosphere (see direct impacts below). This approach is based on information gained from environmental science and conservation biology.[33] However, this is management at the end of a long series of causal factors (known to ecologists as drivers) that are initiated by human consumption, our demand for food, energy, materials and water [35] (see indirect impacts below). It is the assessment of consumer demand for these basic resources that is now a major study area for sustainability science which monitors resource use through the chain of human consumption starting with the effects of lifestyle choices and individual and collective spending patterns, through to the resources used in producing specific goods and services, the demands of economic sectors - and even national economies. This is pre-emptive demand management of causes, rather than a reactive response to the effects of this demand.Sustainability governance can be implemented at all levels of human and biological organization, from local to global.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Direct global environmental impacts\\n\\n[edit] Atmosphere\\nMain topic: climate change\\n\\n \\nUse of the atmosphere \\nTop of the atmosphereThe most obvious human impact on the atmosphere is the air pollution in our cities. The pollutants include toxic chemicals such as nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming the decrease is estimated at about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas: it also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.[36] [37] However, it is now human-induced climate change and the carbon cycle that have become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential for catastrophic effects on both biodiversity and human communities (see Energy below).\\n\\n\\n[edit] Oceans\\n \\nThorsmork, IcelandMain topics: overfishing, ocean acidification, marine pollution.\\n\\n \\nSaltwater fishOceans and their circulation patterns have a critical effect on climate and the food supply for both humans and other organisms. Major environmental impacts occur in the more habitable regions of the oceans – the estuaries, coastline and bays. Because of their vastness oceans act as a dumping ground for human waste. Trends of concern include: ocean warming, reef bleaching and sea level rise, all due to climate change together with the possibility for a sudden alteration of present-day ocean currents which could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe; over-fishing (beyond sustainable levels); and ocean acidification due to dissolved carbon dioxide.[4]\\n\\n\\nRemedial strategies include: more careful waste management, statutory control of overfishing, reduction of fossil fuel emissions, and restoration of coastal and other marine habitat.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Land\\nMain articles: Land use, land-use change and forestry, land cover, urbanization, deforestation.\\n\\nLand use change is fundamental to the operations of the biosphere. This includes alteration to biogeochemical cycles, effects of agriculture, proportions of forest and woodland, grassland and pasture.[4]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Forests\\nMain articles: forestry, deforestation, carbon sequestration, climate change.\\n\\nHistorically about 47% of the world’s forests have been lost to human use. Present-day forests occupy about a quarter of the world’s ice-free land with about half occurring in the tropics [38] In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but deforestation in the tropics is of major concern.\\n\\n \\nBeech Forest - Grib Skov, DenmarkForests can moderate the local climate and the global water cycle through their light reflectance (albedo) and evapotranspiration. They also conserve biodiversity, protect water quality, preserve soil and soil quality, provide fuel and pharmaceuticals, and purify the air. These free ecosystem services have no market value and so forest conservation has little appeal when compared with the economic benefits of logging and clearance which, through soil degradation and organic decomposition returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has estimated that about 90% of the carbon stored in land vegetation is locked up in trees and that they sequester about 50% more carbon than is present in the atmosphere. Changes in land use currently contribute about 20% of total global carbon emissions (in heavily logged Indonesia and Brazil it is the greatest source of emissions).[39] Climate change can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in reafforestation schemes, new plantations, and timber products. Wood biomass is a renewable carbon-neutral fuel.\\n\\n\\nThe FAO has concluded that, over the period 2005–2050, effective use of tree planting could absorb about 10–20% of man-made emissions – so clearly we need to monitor the condition of the world's forests very closely (both reafforestation and deforestation) as they must be part of any coordinated emissions mitigation strategy.[40]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Cultivated land\\nMain articles: agriculture, Green Revolution.\\n\\n \\nRice PaddyFeeding more than six billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth’s resources. This begins with the human appropriation of about 38% [41] of the Earth’s land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity[42]. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness – everything from the initial cultivation need for irrigation water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging, transport (now a major part of global trade) and retail. The benefits of food production are obvious: without food we cannot survive. But the list of costs is a long one: topsoil depletion, erosion and conversion to desert from tillage for monocultures of annual crops; overgrazing; salinization; sodification; waterlogging; high levels of fossil fuel use; reliance on inorganic fertilisers and synthetic organic pesticides; reductions in genetic diversity by the mass use of monocultures; water resource depletion; pollution of waterbodies by run-off and groundwater contamination; social problems including the decline of family farms and weakening of rural communities.[43]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Extinctions\\nMain articles: extinction, International Union for Conservation of Nature.\\n\\n \\nThe Dodo (Raphus cucullatus)In line with human migration and population growth, species extinctions have progressively increased to a rate unprecedented since the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event. Known as the Holocene extinction event this human-induced extinction of species ranks as one of the worlds six mass extinction events. Some scientific estimates indicate that up to half of presently existing species may become extinct by 2100.[44][45]\\n\\n\\nLoss of biodiversity can be attributed largely to the appropriation of land for agroforestry. Current extinction rate are 100 to 1000 times their prehuman levels with more than 10% birds and mammals threatened, about 8% of plants and 5% of fish and more than 20% of freshwater species.[4]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Biological invasions\\n \\nPueraria lobata, Kudzu infesting trees in Atlanta, GeorgiaMain articles: introduced species, invasive species.\\n\\nIncreasingly efficient global transport has facilitated the spread of organisms across the planet. The most stark examples are human diseases like HIV AIDS, mad cow disease and bird flu but invasive plants and animals are now, after climate change and land clearing, the greatest threat to native biodiversity.[46] Non-indigenous organisms often quickly occupy disturbed land but can also devastate natural areas where, in the absence of their natural predators, they are able to thrive.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Freshwater\\nMain articles: freshwater, desalination, limnology, list of countries by freshwater withdrawal, list of countries by total renewable water resources, water resources, water crisis.\\n\\n\\n \\nRiver Fluvia, CataloniaFreshwater habitat is the world’s most vulnerable of the major biological systems due to the human need for potable water for food irrigation, industry and domestic use. Human freshwater withdrawals make up about 10% of global freshwater runoff. [14] and of this 15-35% is considered unsustainable - a proportion that is likely to increase as climate change worsens, populations increase, and water supplies become polluted and unsanitary.[33]\\n\\n\\nIn the industrial world demand management has slowed absolute usage rates but in the developing world water security, and therefore food security, remain among the most important issues to address. Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water.[4]\\n\\n\\n\\n[edit] Indirect global environmental impacts\\nMain article: appropriate technology\\n\\nThe direct impacts on the environment described above are the result of a long chain of causal factors, which is why managing direct human impacts on oceans, atmosphere and land is sometimes called "end of pipe" management; it does not manage the indirect "start of pipe" drivers of this impact which can be reduced to three fundamental factors:\\n\\n \\nPeople - our numbers and consumption patterns (resource use) relate directly to environmental impactspopulation numbers \\nlevels of consumption (affluence) \\nimpact per unit of resource use (which is a result of the technology used) \\nThis has been expressed through an equation: [47]\\n\\nI = PAT\\n\\nwhere: \\nI = environmental impact \\nP = population \\nA = affluence \\nT = technology \\nThis equation has been criticised because: affluence may have positive and negative impact due to the fact that it could either provide the means to tackle environmental problems or promote a higher consumption rate; the equation does not include social considerations such the effect of efficient environmental governance; it is difficult to apply in a realistic and useful way. [48] Nevertheless, it provides a strong starting point for discussion.\\n\\n\\nAddressing sustainability now focuses much of its attention on managing levels of consumption and resource impact by seeking, for example, to modify individual lifestyles, and to apply ideas like ethical consumerism, dematerialisation and decarbonisation, while at the same time exploring more environmentally friendly technology and methods through ecodesign and industrial ecology.\\n\\nAt present individual and household use of resources like energy and water is monitored through domestic water and energy bills and car fuel use – but much greater quantities of these resources are embodied in the goods and services we use. In the same way society as a whole tends to consider environmental management in terms of direct impacts rather than their driver - human consumption. Patterns of consumption must reflect the cleverer use of resources: e.g. using renewable energy rather than fossil fuels and fewer embodied resources in goods and services.[49] [50]
Low-cost terminal\\n\\nThis term is usually applied to a terminal building at an airport, which offers only the most basic features associated with terminals. The advantage of this lies in rapid construction, simplicity in design, and across the range cheaper operating costs. \\n\\nTypical features of a low-cost terminal include:\\n\\n* Simple design \\n* Modularity - all internal functions are designed with future expansion in mind\\n* No air bridges - passengers either walk directly from the building to the departing aircraft, or are bussed to a remote stand\\n* Low development and operating costs - the operator of such a terminal usually aims to attract airlines by offering significantly lower costs to prospective tenants\\n* \\n\\nThese terminals have usually been born out of the demands from [[low-cost carrier]]s, who typically wish to turn around their aircraft in the shortest possible time.remote gates have proven to be the most efficient way of boarding and deplaning passengers.

Worse, much of the "notable" media available to give these new media entries press is limited, either by choice (e.g. being published by a otherwise notable publisher may require giving up significant intellectual property) or the added difficulty in gaining press in a dwindling collection of acceptable notable media outlets, due both to the closing of multiple long-running media outlets as well as the not-yet-established notability of newer media outlets, such as podcasts.\\n\\nIn short, the current attitude on Wikipedia makes adding articles on these subjects difficult, and leaves articles on these subjects vulnerable to deletion from editors following rigid policies that fail to acknowledge all but the most notable topics, which may frustrate readers interested in those subjects and discourage editors who happen to be experts in these topics if improving the articles becomes secondary to keeping those articles from being deleted.
Okinawa Volunteer Zombie Eradication Team\\n\\nBased out of Okinawa, Japan, the Zombie Eradication Team - Okinawa (ZETO) was establised by concerned deployed personnel.  The island of Okinawa is safe from most plague born infestations due to its location and removal from surrounding mainland.  However, its one strength is also it's demise as an infestation such as a Zombie plague may easily overun the local population if given the opportunity for transmission.  A single asymptomatic infected individual that arrived via boat or airplane could easily spread this infestation.  In almost any out-break scenario, modeling shows that not only would airlines be over-taxed and come to a complete stand still, but most harbours would simultaneously be overrun and eventually congested to the point that they would no longer be viable transportation options due to the large surge in refugees attempting to flee. Having all avenues of egress halted or otherwise inoperable, the remaining population is left to fend for its self against insurmountable odds, waging a fight against an enemy it never believed could exist. Chaos would undoubtedly ensue.\\n\\nIn light of this grim possibility, ZET was established to make the necessary precautionary methods to prevent such an outbreak.  Not only is this team among the few that even consider Zomibes a viable threat to man kind and have thus given thought to planning and considerations necessary for survival during a zombie contigency, they are also armed with skills and a select arsenal tailored towards zombie eradication. ZET is the best and only defense against a possible island-wide Zombie Horde.\\n\\nCurrently run under the control of Agent 666 and Agent 999.

'''Flood forecasting''' is the process of predicting the occurrence, magnitude, timing, and duration of floods in a specific area, often by analysing various hydrological, meteorological, and environmental factors. The primary goal of flood forecasting is to deliver timely and accurate information to decision-makers, empowering them to take appropriate actions to mitigate the potential consequences of flooding on human lives, property, and the environment. By accounting for the various dimensions of a flood event, such as occurrence, magnitude, duration, and spatial extent, flood forecasting models can offer a more holistic and detailed representation of the impending risks and facilitate more effective response strategies. \\n\\nFlood forecasting is a multifaceted discipline that aims to predict various aspects of flood events, including their occurrence, magnitude, timing, duration, and spatial extent. However, the scope and definition of flood forecasting can differ across scientific publications and methodologies. In some cases, flood forecasting is focused on estimating the moment when a specific threshold in a river system is exceeded, while in other cases, it involves predicting the flood extent and employing hydrodynamic information from models. \\n\\nWhen flood forecasting is limited to estimating the moment a threshold is exceeded, researchers often concentrate on predicting water levels or river discharge in a particular location. This approach provides valuable information about the potential onset of a flood event, enabling decision-makers to initiate preventive measures and minimize potential damages. In this context, flood forecasting models are designed to predict when the water level or discharge will surpass a predefined threshold, usually based on historical data and established risk levels.\\n\\nOn the other hand, more comprehensive flood forecasting methods involve predicting the flood extent by utilizing hydrodynamic information from models. These approaches not only consider the exceedance of a threshold but also aim to estimate the spatial distribution, timing and extent of the flooding. Hydrodynamic models, such as the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) or the MIKE suite of models, simulate water flow and its interaction with the surrounding environment, providing detailed predictions of flood extent, depth, and velocity.\\n\\nIncorporating hydrodynamic information into flood forecasting models allows for a more complete understanding of the potential impacts of flood events, accounting for factors such as the inundation of infrastructure, agricultural lands, and residential areas. By considering the spatial distribution of flooding, these models enable more effective flood management and response strategies, ensuring that resources are allocated appropriately and that vulnerable populations are adequately protected. \\n\\nFlood forecasting can be done using various methodologies, which can be broadly categorized into physically-based models, data-driven models, or a combination of both. The choice of the most suitable approach depends on factors such as data availability, catchment characteristics, and desired prediction accuracy. Here is an overview of each approach:  \\n\\n'''Physically-based models''' simulate the underlying physical processes involved in flood generation and propagation, such as precipitation, infiltration, runoff, and routing. These models are typically more stable and reliable due to their inherent representation of the physics, making them less susceptible to forecast errors in comparison to data-driven models, especially in the absence of inputs like rainfall. However, physically-based models are state-dependent and require accurate initial conditions for optimal performance. During the so-called "warming period" of the model, the performance might be lower due to the reliance on initial conditions. \\n\\n'''Data-driven models''' focus on discovering patterns and relationships within historical data without explicitly representing the physical processes. They can learn complex, non-linear relationships and adapt to changing conditions, making them useful in situations where data is abundant and accurate representation of physical processes is challenging. Examples of data-driven models include regression techniques, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and tree-based algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost. \\n\\n'''Hybrid models''' combine the strengths of physically-based and data-driven models to enhance flood forecasting accuracy and reliability. Hybrid models can utilize the physical understanding from physically-based models while benefiting from the adaptive learning capabilities of data-driven models. An example of a hybrid model is coupling a hydrological model with a machine learning algorithm to improve flood prediction accuracy. Hybrid models may also incorporate physical processes into the structure of the machine learning models.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Nearing |first1=Grey |last2=Cohen |first2=Deborah |last3=Dube

The main cause of the ecological crisis are human induced activities or anthropocentric acts like mining, pollution, deforestations, construction etcetera, for the global economy to grow.\\nThe solutions to the contemporary ecological crisis is sustainable development. Sustainable development is a type of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, not only for anthropocentric reasons but nature holistically. The concept of sustainable will be successful when the current population stabilize for natural resources to be evenly distributed’ for developed countries like the United States not to consume products that they do not need but they can rather make it accessible to countries who need those resources. \\nThe lifestyle as humans that we all should adopt is a culture of living in an environmentally friendly way. Like reusing, afforestation, and adopting traditions that have certain laws to use the environment sufficiently. The ideas of Saint Francis should be implemented because humans tend to have an idea that they are not part of nature or rather superior than nature which is not the case. \\nThe reason why human beings cause environmental degradation is because of the capitalistic regime. Humans in the ancient stages of life lived sustainably were they were part of nature. Nowadays humans maximize the use of natural resources to maximize their profits. That is why nature is exploited, it is a tool to produce and gain a lot of profit which will impact negatively now and in future.\\nHumans now have the obligation to make amends to the natural environment. Already climatic activities have been altered because of the human induced factors now it is up to humans to be part of nature. Humans need to be ethical about the actions that they act on.

Our gender includes a complex mix of beliefs, behaviors, and characteristics. (ADD CIT PP). Basic gender identity is usually formed by age three and is extremely difficult to change after that.[2] All societies have a set of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a social identity in relation to other members of society. Within the last 15 to 20 years, transgender has expanded to become an umbrella term applied to a diverse group of individuals whose gender identity or expression diverges from culturally deﬁned categories of sex and identity. (ADD CIT JOURNAL.) In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to males and females. In all societies, however, some individuals do not identify with the gender that is assigned to their biological sex. Some cultures employ processes of surgical or hormonal sex reassignment to bring people's biological characteristics in line with their gender identity. In other societies, membership of either of the gender categories is open to people regardless of their biological sex. Whether these differences are a product of nature or nurture has been a contentious topic in the social and biological sciences. It is still an open question to what extent genetic versus social factors plays in determining the gender identities of individuals.\\nThe term "gender identity" was originally a medical term used to explain sex reassignment surgery to the public,[3] but is also found in psychology, often as core gender identity.[4] Although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many factors have been suggested as influencing its development. Biological factors that may influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels and gene regulation.[5] Social factors which may influence gender identity include gender messages conveyed by family, mass media, and other institutions.[6] One's gender identity is also influenced by the social learning theory, which assumes that children develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors, and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way.[7] In some cases, a person's gender identity may be inconsistent with their biological sex characteristics, resulting in individuals dressing and/or behaving in a way which is perceived by others as being outside cultural gender norms; these gender expressions may be described as gender variant or transgender.[8]\\nSelf-concept or self-identity has come to mean how a person understands the way others perceive them. Gender identity does not only refer to the placing of a person into the categories male or female, but also includes the concept of interaction with society on a large scale. People who identify as transsexual may strongly desire that other people consider them to belong to a gender opposite of their karyotype; but often are simply trying to modify their bodies and behaviors to match how they feel inside. This may not have anything to do with being either male or female.\\nWith the development of gender identity being influenced by so many factors, there can also be many problems associated with gender identity as well. One of the major disorders is Gender Identity Disorder. Gender Identity Disorder is defined by strong, persistent feelings of identification with the opposite gender and discomfort with one's own assigned sex.[9] The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (302.85) has five criteria that must be met before a diagnosis of gender identity disorder (GID) can be made. "In gender identity disorder, there is discordance between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine."[3]\\nThe term "Gender Identity Disorder" is in and of itself an incredibly divisive issue. Identity conflicts need to continue over time to be a gender identity disorder. How the gender conflict occurs is different in each person. (ADD CIT .GOV). Many people including medical professionals, caregivers, scholars, researchers, students, human rights advocates, and members of the queer community advocate reform of the psychiatric classification of gender diversity as a mental disorder. This classification reinforces false, negative stereotypes of gender variant people and at the same time fails to legitimize the medical necessity of sex reassignment surgeries (SRS) and procedures for transsexual women and men who urgently need them. As a result, a widening segment of gender non-conforming youth and adults who are subject to the diagnosis of psychosexual disorder, are at risk of experiencing social stigma and loss of civil liberty.\\nToday there are many people supporting people with confusion about gender identity. People are fighting for positive movement towards LGBT people. Currently the President Obama is not signing the executive order protecting LGBT workers. This order would prohibit discrimination by federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. It has become a major focus for gay-rights groups. (ADD CIT) This order would protect an over 16 million more workers who are not already covered by existing corporate policies or state laws. They say LGBT workers suffer discrimination at a disproportionately high rate. The protection would add to an existing executive order prohibiting discrimination based on race, religion, sex and national origin.

Before the 20th century a person's sex would be determined entirely by the appearance of the genitalia, but as chromosomes and genes came to be understood, these were then used to help determine sex. Those defined as women, by sex, have genitalia that is considered female as well as two X chromosomes; those viewed as men, by sex, are seen as having male genitalia, one X and one Y chromosome. However, some individuals have a combination of these chromosomes, hormones, and genitalia that do not follow the traditional definitions of "men" and "women". In addition, genitalia vary greatly or individuals may have more than one type of genitalia. Also, other bodily attributes related to a person's sex (body shape, facial hair, high or deep voice, etc.) may or may not coincide with the social category, as woman or man. A survey of the research literature from 1955–2000 suggests that as many as one in every hundred individuals may have some intersex characteristic.[10] It is suggested that the disorder may be caused by genetic (chromosomal) abnormalities, hormone imbalances during fetal and childhood development, defects in normal human bonding and child rearing, or a combination of these factors.(ADD CIT WEB MD) Most people recognize that they have a gender identity problem before they reach adolescence. The disorder occurs more often in males than in females. ADD CIT WEB MD)\\nTranssexual self-identified people sometimes wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their primary sexual characteristics, secondary characteristics, or both. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. Historically, such surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is broadly against genital assignment, shaped to a significant extent by the mature feedback of adults who regret these decisions being made on their behalf at their birth. Gender reassignment surgery elected by adults is also subject to several kinds of debate. One discussion involves the legal sex-gender status of transgender people, for marriage, retirement and insurance purposes, for example. Another involves whether such surgery is ethically sound.[citation needed]\\nThe most easily understood case in which it becomes necessary to distinguish between sex and gender is that in which the external genitalia are removed—when such a thing happens through an accident or through deliberate intent, the libido and the ability to express oneself in sexual activity are changed, but the individual's gender identity may or may not change. One such case is that of David Reimer, reported in As Nature Made Him by John Colapinto. It details the persistence of a male gender identity and the stubborn adherence to a male gender role of a person whose penis had been totally destroyed shortly after birth as the result of a botched male circumcision, and who had subsequently been surgically reassigned by constructing female genitalia.[13] In other cases, a person's gender identity may contrast sharply with that assigned to them according to their genitalia, and/or a person's gendered appearance as a woman or man (or an androgynous person, etc.) in public may not coincide with their physical sex. So the term "gender identity" is broader than the sex of the individual, as determined by examination of the external genitalia, but also includes the sex or gender one identifies with mentally.\\n[edit]\\nHistory\\n[edit]\\nConceptual origins\\nIn 1905, Sigmund Freud presented his theory of psychosexual development in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality. Freud believed gender identity developed during the phallic stage of development. According to Freud, during this stage, young boys develop an Oedipus complex where they have an unconscious sexual desire for their mother and jealousy or hatred for their father. That jealousy turns into emulation as the child seeks to be like their father, eventually identifying with him.[7] In 1913, Carl Jung proposed the Electra complex as an analogous phenomenon in girls. This proposal, however, was rejected by Freud.[14]\\nDuring the 1950s and '60s, psychologists began studying gender development in young children, partially in an effort to understand the origins of homosexuality (which was viewed as a mental disorder at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the UCLA Medical Center for the study of intersexuals and transsexuals. Psychoanalyst Robert Stoller generalized many of the findings of the project in his book Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term gender identity to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in 1963. Behavioral psychologist John Money was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at Johns Hopkins Medical School's Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an interactionist theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book Man and Woman, Boy and Girl (1972) became widely used as a college textbook, although many of Money's ideas have since been challenged.[15]\\n[edit]\\nIn the DSM\\nFurther information: gender identity disorder\\nThe notion of gender identity appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in its third edition, DSM-III (1980), in the form of two psychiatric diagnoses of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and transsexualism (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, the DSM-III-R added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed the GIDC and transsexualism in a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder.[16]\\nThe conceptualization of sex-gender mismatch as a mental disorder is controversial.[16]\\n[edit]\\nInternational Human Rights Law\\nThe Yogyakarta Principles, which is a document on application of international human rights law, provides definition on gender identity. In the preamble, "gender identity" is understood to refer to each person's deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the person's sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other experience of gender, including dress, speech and mannerism. Further, in Principle 3, that each person's self-defined gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and Freedom. These Principles influenced the UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity.\\n[edit]\\nGender identity and sex\\nIn the English language, the terms sex and gender are often used interchangeably in the vernacular. However, in a medical and technically scientific sense, these words are not synonymous. Increasingly, the term gender is being accepted to define psychophysiologic processes involved in identity and social role. It is defined by one's own identification as male, female, or intersex; gender may also be based on legal status, social interactions, public persona, personal experiences, and psychologic setting. Sex, from the Latin word sexus, is defined by the gonads, or potential gonads, either phenotypically or genotypically. It is generally assigned at birth by external genital appearance, due to the common assumption that this represents chromosomal or internal anatomic status. (ADD CIT MEDSCAPE) Therefore gender and sex are different and is not being recognized as such.\\nWhen the gender identity of a person makes them one gender, but their genitals suggest a different sex, they will likely experience what is called gender dysphoria.[17] Some people do not believe that their gender identity corresponds to their biological sex, including transsexual people, transgender people, and many intersexed individuals. Consequently, complications arise when society insists that an individual adopt a manner of social expression (gender role) which is based on sex, that the individual feels is inconsistent with that person's gender identity. Complications can also arise with the stereotyping, or gender typing of behavior for individuals for behavior related to a specific sex, when they identify as a different gender. This dissonance can lead to gender identity disorder.\\nOne reason for such discordances in intersexed people is that some individuals have a chromosomal sex that has not been expressed in the external genitalia because of hormonal or due to other abnormal conditions during critical periods in gestation. Such a person may appear to others to be of one sex, but may recognize himself or herself as belonging to the other sex[citation needed]. The causes of transgenderism are less clear; it has been subject of much speculation, but no psychological theory has ever been proven to apply to even a significant minority of transgender individuals, and theories that assume a sex difference in the brain are relatively new and difficult to prove, because at the moment they require a destructive analysis of inner brain structures, which are quite small.\\nIn recent decades it has become possible to surgically reassign sex. A person who experiences gender dysphoria may then seek these forms of medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity. Alternatively, some people who experience gender dysphoria retain the genitalia that they were born with (see transsexual for some of the possible reasons), but adopt a gender role that is consistent with what they perceive as their gender identity.\\nThere is an emerging vocabulary for those who defy traditional gender identity; see Transgender and Genderqueer.[18]\\n[edit]\\nBiological causes of transsexuality\\nStudies of gonads, genitalia, and hormone levels in gender dysphoric persons have not been able to propose any biological explanations for why some persons experience gender dysphoria. One study of the brains of six transsexual male to female individuals have shown a correlation between the size of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc) and gender dysphoria. The BSTc is normally 2.5 times larger in men than in women, but the average among the male-to-female transsexuals was only 52% of the reference non-transsexual males, which lies within the normal female range.[19] Another study of the same group found that the number of somatostatin neurons in male-to-female transsexuals was also closer to the normal female range than to that of males, and one female-to-male transsexual was shown to have a neuron number within the normal male range.[20]\\n[edit]\\nNature versus nurture\\nAn ongoing debate in psychology is the extent to which gender identity and gender-specific behavior is due to socialization versus in-born factors. The mainstream view is that both factors play a role, but the relative importance of each is contentious.[citation needed]\\nBecause of the pervasiveness of gender roles, it is difficult to design a study which controls for the influence of such socialization. Individuals who are sex reassigned at birth offer an opportunity to see what happens when a child who is genetically one sex is raised as the other. The largest study of such individuals was conducted by Reiner & Gearhart on 14 children born with cloacal exstrophy and reassigned female at birth. Upon follow-up between the ages of 5 to 12, 8 of them identified as boys, and all of the subjects had at least moderately male-typical attitudes and interests.[21]\\nThe roles that are expected of men and women differ from culture to culture, indicating to some that nature may not be the sole determiner of gender identity.[citation needed]\\n[edit]\\nNon-Western gender identities\\nSee also: Third gender and Two-Spirit\\n[edit]\\nFa'afafine\\nIn some Polynesian societies, fa'afafine are considered to be a "third gender" alongside male and female. They are biologically male, but dress and behave in a manner considered typically female. According to Tamasailau Sua'ali'i (see references), fa'afafine in Samoa at least are often physiologically unable to reproduce. Fa'afafine are accepted as a natural gender, and neither looked down upon nor discriminated against.[22] Fa'afafine also reinforce their femininity with the fact that they are only attracted to and receive sexual attention from straight masculine men. They have been and generally still are initially identified in terms of labour preferences, as they perform typically feminine household tasks.[23] The Samoan Prime Minister is patron of the Samoa Fa'afafine Association.[24]\\n[edit]\\nHijra\\nIn the culture of the Indian subcontinent, a hijra is usually considered to be neither a man nor a woman. Most are biologically male or intersex, but some are biologically female. The hijra form a third gender, although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. They can run their own households, and their occupations are singing and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes prostitutes (for men), or long-term sexual partners for men. Hijras can be compared to transvestites or drag queens of contemporary western culture.[25]\\n[edit]\\nXanith\\nThe xanith form an accepted third gender in Oman, a gender-segregated society. The xanith are male homosexual prostitutes whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Xanith can mingle with women, and they often do at weddings or other formal events. Xaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their society, xaniths can marry women, proving their masculinity by consummating the marriage. Should a divorce or death take place, these men can revert to their status as xaniths at the next wedding.[26]\\n[edit]\\nSee also\\n	Gender bias\\n	Gender differences\\n	Sex/gender distinction\\n	Queer theory\\n	Queer studies\\n	Masculinity\\n	Femininity\\n	Intersexuality\\n	Identity (social science)\\n	List of transgender-related topics\\n[edit]\\nReferences\\n	^ Neil R., Carlson, and Donald Heth C..

Waterspouts exist on a microscale, where their environment is less than two kilometers in width. Their bigger cloud that develops them can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus, or as great as a supercell. While some waterspouts are strong (tornadic) like their land-based counterparts, most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics. They normally develop in moisture-laden environments with little vertical wind shear along lines of convergence, such as land breezes, lake effect bands, lines of frictional convergence from nearby landmasses, or surface troughs. Waterspouts normally develop as their parent clouds are in the process of development, and it is theorized that they spin up as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal shear near the surface, and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus or thunderstorm. Weak tornadoes, known as landspouts, have been shown to develop in a similar manner.[2]

The general assumption is that government owned external land is public space but with several exceptions such as military sites or government buildings that do not have a public function (such as the gardens of the White House or the lawns of the Pentagon). Space owned by private organisations such as churches, corporations or charities can offer public access to their space, but with rules that do not apply to state owned public space. graveyards, National Trust coast line and art galleries blur this distinction of not always being state owned, but can be treated in many respects as Public Space.\\n\\nThe time of day can also change the way Public Space may be used. At 12 noon, office workers may be encouraged to use an office plaza for lunchtime, but at 12 midnight, loitering may not at all be acceptable.
THE CURRENT STATUS OF ICT IN ETHIOPIA\\n1 Overview An ICT policy should start with an assessment of the country’s current ICT situation. ICT in Ethiopia at present is at the very early stage of development. Nearly the entire rural population lacks telecommunications infrastructure. The vast majority of the population is dependent only on the conventional and traditional information delivery system, the radio or newspapers. Other major indicators pointing to the low level of ICT development in the country are: • Limitations in telecommunications network, which is mainly designed for voice grade communication, and limited numbers of both fixed and mobile telephones. • Lack of skilled human resources coupled with low ICT literacy. • Low level of Internet service and poor connectivity. • Underdeveloped physical and telecommunications infrastructure. • Underdeveloped market for computer hard- and software products aggravated by high cost of acquisition. • Lack of organized data and information resources, and poor accessibility to those that exist. • Limited or no public awareness on the role and potential of ICT. • Undeveloped private sector • Legal and regulatory constraints. \\nNot only is ICT least developed in Ethiopia; it is also highly skewed towards major cities and towns, particularly Addis Ababa. In part, this is due to limitations in both physical and ICT infrastructure, and partly due to the limited number of computers. Consequently, while the Internet and other forms of information and communications technology are readily available in Addis Ababa, limited access to ICT by the rural population continues to be a major impediment to the use of ICT nation-wide. These constraints present the Government with real challenges, but also opportunities, for an accelerated development of ICT in Ethiopia. \\n2 Government Efforts \\nEven though still in its infancy, ICT in Ethiopia has developed rapidly in recent years. In part this is because, in recognition of the vital importance of ICT in the development process, the Government has been undertaking several strategic policy initiatives that promote its development. Initiatives taken by the Government to 8 promote the development of ICT include the relevant components of PSCAP, in particular ICT capacity building, Electronic government (woreda-net) and Electronic education (school-net) programs. The development of ICT in Ethiopia has also been influenced by legal and regulatory measures. These include the 1996 proclamation providing for the introduction of competition and licensing for multiple operators. The private sector has since been active in providing ICT and related goods and services, and several firms provide computer hard- and soft-ware and services at present. Consistent with its policy objectives, the Government has been licensing large numbers of private sector operators to set up cyber-cafes and to engage in sales, installation and service of communications equipment. Although the private sector is expected to take the lead in ICT development, it has so far remained largely undeveloped with operations confined to major urban centers, particularly Addis Ababa, with limited or no activities in the rural areas of the country. Reform of Ethiopia’s telecommunications industry also resulted in the establishment of the Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation, a public telecom operator providing services in fixed, mobile, Internet and data communications. The establishment of the Corporation was followed by the introduction of Internet service in 1997 and mobile telephone service in 1998. The Corporation has been aggressively expanding rural connectivity in tandem with the Government’s decentralization, public and civil reform programs. The Government’s commitment to the development of ICT is also reflected in rising public expenditure in the sector. Public investment in ICT infrastructure and services increased substantially from a paltry US$29 million in 2002 to US$300 million in 2004. Increases in investment have resulted in improvements in ICT infrastructure and services nation-wide both in the public and private sectors. Technologies and services that have particularly experienced expansion include telephone infrastructure and services, mobile/cellular telephone, mobile radio communication, pay-phones, the Internet, Internet cafe services and community centers, which provide a broad range of multi-purpose communication services such as the telephone, fax, computer, e-mail and media services. Even though recent trends in the development of ICT have shown dynamic growth in both infrastructure and services, ICT in Ethiopia still remains the least developed as compared to countries in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere in the world. Proper data communication network is only beginning to make its appearance, the number of computers remains negligible, and the availability of computer hard- and soft-ware products limited. \\nIt is clear, therefore, that much remains to be done, and the Government is determined to step up efforts for the development of ICT in the interests of sustainable growth and poverty reduction, as well as for deepening the process of democratization and good governance. The Government is already taking aggressive measures towards this end and has embarked on programs aimed at improving and expanding physical and ICT infrastructure and services as the backbone for the development of a robust ICT sector in the country.
The Wikimedia Foundation and IBISWorld's Quality Project\\n\\nThe Wikimedia Foundation and IBISWorld share the goals of empowering and engaging people around the world, collecting and developing educational content and to disseminating it effectively and globally. \\n\\nOne of our key goals in this project is to help to continually improve Wikipedia's already high standard of quality, especially in relation to economic, industry and business data, our areas of expertise. \\n\\nPart of this process requires us to upload and update relevant information and facts from our studies on to wiki pages. Like Wikipedia, all our information is completely unbiased. Both our qualitative and quantitative studies are stringently scrutinized and clearly backed by meticulous research and resources. \\n\\nIBISWorld never promotes companies, governments or individuals. We are industry and economic researchers. We are already providers of industry analysis and economic data to many of the world's largest universities, libraries, governments and international institutions. We believe its part of our job to continually work to improve and bolster the quality of information freely available on the internet.
The International School for Peace is a non-profit preschool that opened in August 2004 with a focus on peace and conflict resolution. By immersing the children in multicultural language and culture experiences, the International School for Peace promotes peace within the individual, the community, and the world.\\n\\nThe International School for Peace offers play-based full and partial language immersion preschool classes in Spanish. Our partial immersion classrooms provide English instruction (70%) with Spanish language enrichment activities (30%). Our full immersion classes are taught in Spanish. Children in all classrooms receive exposure to the language through songs, games, and cultural activities. Conflict resolution skills are used every day.\\n\\nThe International School for Peace offers a play-based, child-centered, multicultural, anti-bias curriculum. We promote and celebrate diversity in our school, community and world through stories, books, games, songs, cultural artifacts, and visual materials that positively depict all races, cultures, ages, physical abilities, religions, socioeconomic status, and family configurations without stereotyping.
Currently I am making contributions for several reasons: I want to practice my writing skills and request comment and feedback from other contributors as a means of improving my writing. I have read through Wikipedia's guidelines about quality and find it nearly impossible to digest all of it. Instead, small steps with criticism might be more productive. Secondly, I am interested in how the English speaking world has acted, reacted, and interacted with other parts of the world. My recent contributions focus on an Indian guru,  a newspaper editor, British colonial officials, a Togolese writer, and a Dutch-Indonesian writer.  I explore how these interactions shape and re-shape the English language. I see them as contributions to the most studied language in the world. Finally, I need to become more competent with the technical dimensions of writing, such as citing reliable sources, notability criteria, references and so forth. One of the most challenging things about Wikipedia is the opportunity to expand the notability criteria.
{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n\\nDeep Green Resistance (DGR) is an environmental movement that views mainstream environmental activism as being largely ineffective.[1] DGR also refers to the strategy described by the movement for saving the Earth. DGR believes that industrial civilization is endangering all life on the planet. It advocates for a radical shift in society's structure and function and calls for humans to actively fight for the Earth. DGR's goals are to stop those in power from destroying the planet and to stop industrial civilization altogether. Ultimately, they intend for landbases to be restored and for the human communities that inhabit these areas to be sustainable. DGR has attracted attention because of its controversial nature--it does not condemn violent protest as inappropriate environmental activism.\\n\\nBeliefs\\n\\nThe Deep Green Resistance movement believes that civilization, particularly industrial civilization, is fundamentally unsustainable and must be actively dismantled in order to secure a livable future for all species on the planet.[1] DGR identifies several traits that make industrial civilization a threat to the planet. Civilization relies heavily on machinery, which operates largely on non-renewable and unclean fossil fuels. Civilization has been mechanized beyond the scale at which human communities can operate equitably. Industrial agriculture has caused a dramatic population increase, which DGR cites as the cause of "global ecological devastation". In geological time civilization is a recent phenomenon and DGR argues that its expansion has resulted in the loss of a great deal of traditional knowledge. Cities, which form a basis for civilization, are believed to be unable to sustain themselves by DGR.  \\n\\nDGR's principles stem from the concept of Deep Ecology, which states that all species are inherently equal, and thus that humans are not superior to any other form of life. Deep Ecology attributes the current environmental crisis to the anthropocentrism that is embedded in Western perspectives. The term, first used by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess, was quickly taken up by a variety of radical environmental groups, such as Earth First!. Deep ecology provides a foundation upon which to base the cross-cultural nature-based spirituality that is often associated with radical environmental movements. \\n\\nThe movement differentiates itself from "Bright Green Environmentalism", which is characterized by a focus on personal, technological, or government and corporate solutions,[1] in that it holds these solutions as inadequate. DGR believes that lifestyle changes, such as using travel mugs and reusable bags and taking shorter showers, are too small for the large scale environmental problems the world faces. It also states that the recent surge in environmentalism has become commercial in nature, and thus it in itself has been industrialized. The movement asserts that per capita industrial waste produced is orders of magnitude greater than personal waste produced; therefore, it is industrialism that must be ended, and with that lifestyle changes will follow.\\n\\nTactics\\n\\nThe Deep Green perspective argues that the dominant culture, a term that encompasses all societies that are based on industrialism, will not undergo a voluntary transformation to a sustainable way of living. This includes the dismissal of a possible success of a slow and soft shift to sustainability. Individuals of the Deep Green movement believe that industrial civilization will inevitably collapse. This notion is based on historical evidence of the collapse of major civilizations such as Rome or the Mayan civilization. DGR maintains that humans must be act decisively before the collapse to ensure the Earth that remains is inhabitable for all organisms and that humans build a more sustainably structured society following the collapse. The Deep Green Resistance supports an active resistance movement with the objective of accelerating the collapse of industrial civilization.[1]\\n\\nWithin the Deep Green theory, lifestyle or personal changes are not considered effective methods of creating meaningful change. The mainstream environmental movement is seen as being distracted by its emphasis on individual lifestyle changes and technological solutions instead of confronting systems of power and holding individuals, industries, and institutions accountable. [2][3]\\nThe founders of the Deep Green movement view technological solutions, no matter how well intentioned, as unsatisfactory and warns they could even lead to accelerated ecological destruction and pollution (see Jevons Paradox). The Deep Green movement looks to pre-industrial and pre-civilization, land-based cultures as models for sustainable ways of living.[1]\\n\\nOrigins and Advocates\\n\\nThe term was created for a conference entitled "Deep Green Resistance. Confronting Industrial Culture" in April, 2007 in Deerfield, Massachusetts. Lierre Keith was the main organizer.\\n\\nDeep Green theory draws on elements of anthropology, phenomenology, deep ecology and ecofeminism.\\n\\nDerrick Jensen is a prominent public advocate of Deep Green Resistance. In addition to being a radical activist, he is also a writer, philosopher and teacher. Lierre Keith, another well-known member is a feminist activist, writer and small farmer. Another advocate is activist, writer and organic farmer Aric McBay. Waziyatawin, Stephanie McMillan, and Jack D. Forbes are also prominent members of the movement. DGR draws on the philosophy and writings of many authors, including Richard Manning, Andrea Dworkin, Peggy Reeves Sanday, David Abram, Chellis Glendinning, Chris Hedges, Joseph Tainter, Richard Heinberg, Daniel Quinn, Zoe Blunt and Jerry Mander, among others.[1]\\n\\nLiterature and References\\n\\nA book titled Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet by Aric McBay, Lierre Keith, and Derrick Jensen was released in May 2011, from Seven Stories Press.[4] The book is divided into four sections: Resistance, Organization, Strategy and Tactics, and the Future. Each section contains several essays written by McBay or Keith and concludes with Jensen's answers to common questions about resistance. The book intends to provide a framework from which readers can build upon in order to begin fighting for environmental change.\\n\\nCriticism\\n\\nMajor opposition against Deep Green Resistance is similar to opposition toward anarcho-primitivism and Deep Ecology. Opponents claim that technology and social changes will exist in the future to solve the problems. They also frequently state that advocates of DGR's beliefs are merely misanthropic, destructive nihilists, and that the end of industrial civilization would pose a moral dilemma because of the need for a reduced population (due to the end of industrial agriculture and mass production) and the relinquishment of life-saving technologies.[5][6] Therefore, many argue that DGR does not offer a feasible or desirable alternative human lifestyle. Opponents believe that DGR's goals are unrealistic because they are too extreme to become widely accepted in today's society.[7]\\n\\nDeep Green Resistance is controversial, in a large part, because they do not condemn violent action as a means by which to invoke environmental change. While DGR maintains that it is a strictly aboveground movement and denies having an underground, it does encourage underground action. This is construed as ecoterrorism by critics, and can be a deterrent to environmentalists who believe in nonviolent activism.\\n\\nIt may also be true that, as the environment's degradation[8] increases, DGR's viewpoint may gain more supporters. The Earth First![9] / Edward Abbey[10] perspective around monkey-wrenching[11] and eco-tage[12] were, arguably, a problematic way of addressing problems at that time (for an interesting display of division within the green radical movement on a previous occasion when a perspective similar to that held by DGR was popular, see the book Defending the Earth[13], which recounts debate between Earth First!'s David Foreman[14] and the social ecologist Murray Bookchin[15], centered around statements on the part of Foreman that Bookchin deemed anti-human). Now, it is possible that the ecological inertia[16] and the inertia of the global capitalist-industrial system[17] means that only such methods are meaningful. Many are, and should be, discomfited by such suggestions. However, it is a long time since the Club of Rome[18] report 'Limits to Growth'[19], the Brundtland report[20], and subsequent efforts to engage international governmental and corporate support were instituted (for example the Kyoto[21] and Rio[22] summits under the auspices of the UN), and many would now perceive them as having failed[23] [24] (and, to the extent that they are argued to have been successful, many would argue that there has been a profit-protecting greenwash[25] [26] to hide minimal actual change).\\nDGR is one response to a situation that many perceive as beyond control. Its members have an approach to fighting back, and see themselves as tomorrow's freedom fighters, whilst being fully aware that the underground (perhaps willing to use physical coercion, for example) part of the movement, at least, is currently more likely to be perceived as terrorist in nature, though the overground[27] part of the movement is more subtle, adhering to a code of conduct[28]. In the book, the activities of an underground are signposted more than they are explicated, which is a wise move on the part of its authors. And, in fact, they seek to inform and educate on 'security' and 'warfare' whilst at the same time denying that they represent an 'underground', as this quote from their website illustrates:\\n"It provides an exploration of organizational structures, recruitment, security, and target selection for both aboveground and underground* action. Deep Green Resistance also discusses a culture of resistance and the crucial support role that it can play.\\n"Deep Green Resistance is a plan of action for anyone determined to fight for this planet—and win\\n"*Note: We are strictly an aboveground movement. We will not answer questions regarding anyone’s personal desire to be in or form an underground. We do this for the security of all involved with Deep Green Resistance."[29]\\nFurther critique from this perspective, quite strongly expressed (the article accuses DGR of 'crypto-green-fascism') can be seen on the Libcom website, for example[30].
Sexual identity is associated with sex, gender, and sexual orientation. Sex is biologically and based on ones anatomy. Gender is the intergrated cognitive, social. And emotional schemes assosiciated with being male or female. Sexual orientation refers to ones preference for and attraction to sexually intimate partners. Sexual identity begins with the formation of gender identity in early childhood. (Newman). It involves applying the correct gender label and gender stability and consistancy. Sexual identity is later developed and formed during adolescence. Adolescence is a stage in which great identity (and sexual identity) confusion and exploration occurs. During adolescence we begin to apply and test the gender labels we have provided for ourselves. We do this through intimate and sexual relationships. During this stage, one can change their sexual orientation and identity.\\n\\nSexual orientation refers to ones preference and attraction to sexual partners. The terms used to describe sexual orientation includes, heterosexual (straight), homosexual (gay/lesbian), bisexual (attraction to both sexes), and asexual (no attraction to either sex). Once a person feels confident on their sexual orientation, has gender stability and consistence, that is when their sexual identity is formed.
The Mumbai terrorist attacks struck India's tourism industry but it will be resilient and bounce back as it did post-September 2001. The present crisis presents an opportunity. There was an even bigger crisis in Indian tourism in 2001-02. The attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, war in Afghanistan, withdrawal of flights, attack on Parliament House in New Delhi and troop mobilisation on the India-Pakistan border meant that Indian hotels had just 20-25 per cent occupancy. International tour operators had removed India from their sale brochures and inbound Indian tour operators had switched to outbound operations.

They are twice as likely to enter old age living as a single person; and two and a half times more likely to live alone. Because discrimination and harassment still exist, they are less likely to access health care, housing, or social services. When using such services to meet our needs, they often have to cope with others’ homophobia or ignorance.\\n \\nAdditionally, because of legal protections for partnership, most gay and lesbian partners face additional financial difficulties related to tax burdens, health insurance, and inheritance rights, many of which becoming particularly acute later in life. It is still legal to fire gay or lesbian seniors in 34 states because of their sexual orientation. Surviving lesbian and gay partners face different financial difficulties upon the death of their loved one.  They are not eligible for the Social Security survivor benefits as is a heterosexual married partner, heavily taxed on retirement plans—401(k) or IRA—inherited from partners, while married partners inherit these plans tax-free, and charged estate tax on inheritance of home, even if jointly owned, a tax that does not apply to married spouses.\\n\\nDespite advances in the acceptance of lesbians and gay men in many aspects of American life and more individuals living “out,” most retirement communities still do not welcome lesbians and gay men as residents.  Almost no communities address this issue in their policies or practices, and few offer cultural competency training for their staff in working with the LGBT community.  For decades, lesbians and gay men have entered retirement communities only by retreating to “the closet,” pretending to be sisters or cousins, or couples have split up and entered as individuals rather than as partners.  Many others forego the option completely, unwilling to live in a community where they would have to hide their identity and history.\\n\\nCurrent studies document homophobic policies and practices by nursing home administrators, Area Agencies on Aging directors, and health care providers, as well as out-right discrimination and mistreatment by staff in long-term care facilities.  Thus, lesbians, gay men and transgender individuals are five times less likely to seek adequate health care or needed social services out of fear of discovery and ridicule. \\n\\nAs a result, a trend in the active adult and retirement community housing market is the creation of communities specifically for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. \\n\\n'''External Links\\n'''\\n----\\n\\n[http://www.gaylesbianretiring.org Gay and Lesbian Association of Retired Persons]<BR>\\n[http://www.asaging.org/networks/index.cfm?cg=LGAIN Lesbian and Gay Aging Issues Network]<BR>\\n[http://www.flock2it.com Birds of a Feather Resort Communities] - Pecos, New Mexico<BR>\\n[http://www.opencirclecommunities.com Open Circle Communities] - Rehoboth Beach, Delaware<BR>\\n[http://www.palmsofmanasota.com Palms of Manasota] - Palmetto, Florida<BR>\\n[http://www.paradise-one.com Paradise One] - Easthampton, Massachusetts<BR>\\n[http://www.rainbowvisionprop.com Rainbow Vision Properties] - RainbowVision
[[image:climber.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A pet rat.]]\\nCitizens on Planet Earth have had a difficult time governing themselves over all of the millennia that this small planet has had intelligent citizens. There were some particularly disastrous detours in their 20th century. But now as they enter what they call their 3rd millennium they seem to be making progress in the ways of democracy.\\n\\nIt is worth taking a few moments to sketch the history of governments and the birth pains of democracy on Planet Earth.\\n\\nIn the early days of Homo sapiens, earthlings lived in small tribes of a few hundred people at most. They had tools. They had fire. They had language. They did not have agriculture or animal husbandry or writing.\\n\\nFood and shelter were scarce. Competition with other animals -- especially other human tribes -- was often severe. To survive they had a kind of rough and ready direct democracy. There were tribal elders or chiefs but everyone knew everyone else and everyone was roughly equal. Equally poor in what they could command of energy and material resources.
Street Jumping is a North American term for Free Running. The reason for the change in name is mainly because in North American there are less broken down and abandoned areas as in former U.S.S.R. countries, such as Russia. As a result, Street Jumpers do less running, and more jumping over various obstacles, such as fences, public trash cans, Postal boxes, ect.\\n\\nIt is widely believed that Street Jumping, or Free Running, has been practiced long before it was introduced by Sebastien Foucan. All over the world, children and teens would go to great lengths to pass obstacles in the fastest and, in this case, most interesting way. This was never internationally recognized, but it was practiced in cities around the globe.\\n\\nStreet Jumping is a North Americanized form of Free Running, which in turn is a more relaxed and aesthetics form of Parkour. Some might even argue that it is just a more developed and extreme version of the popular game "Cops and Robbers".\\n\\nAlthough very similar, Street Jumping is to Free Running, what Free Running is to Parkour. I don't think that both articles should be merged, as the term "Free Running" is not as widely know or used in some regions of North America, especially Canada. They are different, and, as a result they both deserve different articles.
I'm fascinated by [[energy]], both in the sense that the word is used in science and as it is applied in everyday life.\\nThe Wikipedia definition describes various ''forms'' of energy, but no-one seems to know what energy per se actually is. As I understand it, energy can't be created or destroyed, but it can change form, and matter is just one of these forms. This tells me that the energy I'm made of has always existed, and is the reason for my Wikipedia username.\\nMy own level of physical and mental energy varies from time to time, depending on the state of my health, what I eat and drink, the weather, what's happening around me and a host of other factors. \\nEnergy also drives civilisation and the global economy, which is why I believe climate change and peak oil are the biggest issues facing humanity.\\nBy the way, if anyone can tell me exactly what energy is, or explain that climate change or peak oil aren't worth worrying about, I'd be most grateful!
\\nFounded by Bishop Stephen E. Young,Sr. in 2001.The '''Peace In The Streets'''(PITS) Festival brings together over 5,000 attendees from communities across the Washington Metropolitan Area and provides a place where families, communities, and organizations can come, have a good time and express their concerns through information sharing. It provides an opportunity to creatively address the problem of homicide and violence that has plagued many families in the Washington Metropolitan area and builds partnerships with other organizations and individuals to implement solutions.\\n\\n \\nThe most simplistic, yet vital message we can present to you relative to our PEACE IN THE STREETS event is That: Peace is for all people. With that in mind, weapons will be surrendered under the guideline of the District's weapons amnesty policy signaling an arrest to the criminal activity that plagues our neighborhoods and communities.\\n\\nPITS encompass and celebrate the spirit of peace through music, food, the areas and the Gospel.  Beginning with a bike-a-thon and parade, the festival includes a health fair, job fair, amusements/games for children and much more.
\\nSALTY Magazine is a free-online publication targeted to a young generation of Christian disciples to be "the salt of the earth," (Matthew5:13). \\n\\nwww.saltymagazine.com\\n\\nIn ancient times, salt was an essential ingredient in mixtures for its purifying, cleansing, and preserving qualities. This resulted in those who live according to God’s word being called “the salt of the earth.” Therefore, SALTY magazine is dedicated to displaying the invaluable purpose young Christians have in today’s society as preservers of truth, beauty, justice and purity. We also explore, challenge and redefine what it means to be young and submitted to God’s will. The pages of the magazine are filled with thought-provoking articles, inspirational testimonies, and fresh features tackling issues our generation face today.
I am a neurologist and ALS Researcher. One of the reasons I have become involved with Wikipedia is that my patients often come to me with articles downloaded from the Internet – often well sourced from Wikipedia! This is one of the fantastic ways that medicine has moved on from the bad old days of paternalism – now patients (or clients) are up to date, want to know more and are keen to become involved in research. \\n\\nBut some information out there (all over the Internet) is misleading, misrepresentative and gives false hope to terminally ill patients.... and even worse, sometimes a vulnerable section of people are exploited.  \\n\\nMy hope is to see that the neurology research on Wikipedia continues to be well-written, peer-reviewed and a reliable source of information for those who need it most.
\\n== '''HISTORY''' ==\\n\\n\\nFuture Fibre Technologies (FFT) was established in 1994 in Melbourne, Australia as a company researching and developing fibre-optic sensing technologies. It began as a small start-up company with an idea to use optical fibres to detect vibrations caused by physical defects in or disturbances to structures such as bridges and pipelines. This led to the first FFT product, the Movement and Vibration sensor. \\n\\nBy the late 1990s, it was becoming clear that there was a need in the intrusion detection industry for cost effective distributed optical fibre sensors to protect large perimeters, buried pipelines and communications links. In 1998, FFT conceived the Microstrain Locator technology which had the potential to pinpoint the location of intrusions over many km’s of deployed optical fibre. Research and development efforts over the next 5 years led to the first commercialisation in 2002 of FFT’s core products – FFT Secure Fence, FFT Secure Pipe and FFT Secure Link.  \\n\\nBy 2008 FFT had over 1 million metres of optical fibre installed in over 150 intrusion detection systems worldwide.  This includes a number of key military, government and civil installations establishing FFT as a key global player in the intrusion detection industry.\\n\\nToday, FFT continues to be a key player in the intrusion detection industry with a growing business, expanding product portfolio and global reputation.
Christianity is a monotheistic Abrahamic religion of those who believe that Jesus of Nazareth was not merely a teacher and model of a pious life, but is the revealer of God and the mediator of salvation from sin. It shares the Old Testament teachings with Judaism. Mainstream Christians agree on the resurrection of Jesus and the Trinity (God the Father, Jesus the Son and the Holy Ghost) Jesus representing the immanence and the Holy Spirit the Transcendance of God – God being infinite and only knowable through Jesus and the Holy Ghost. Christianity has developed into six main ecclesiastico-cultural bloks: Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, Independents and Marginals (Barratt, 2001:3-5). Christianity is especially based in the Gospels of the New Testament, although it also draws on the Old Testament, believing the Bible to be the word of God. The main injunctions of Christianity are ‘Love God’ and ‘Love thy neighbour’. The former has led Christianity to be exclusive in its faith with a history of violence in the attempt to convert infidels and a stereotype of disrespect for other faiths – these indiscretions being taken as an inseparable part of Christianity (Küng, 1995:7-9). The latter has given Christianity the inspiration to apply its teachings (from c.500 onwards) to create a society of equality in terms of health and education.
'''\\n== GMOs ==\\n''' \\n\\n\\nDo you want to live in a world where weeds are tolerant to herbicides, causing farmers to use more and more herbicides? Do you want to live in a world where there is a major increase in allergies? Do you want to live in a world where all plants that are consumed by humans are GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) or in a world that there are antibiotic resistant super-diseases? GMOs are made by adding DNA from other organism into a crop causing it to do a specific task, like being tolerant to herbicides. One of the major problems with GM (Genetically Modified) food is that it is poorly tested and even though the tests were negative GM foods are on the market. Two other major problems are that GMOs are unlabeled. Once a GM food is created the genetic contamination cannot be cleaned up or contained. Some companies that produce GMO foods were also behind the development of risky chemicals suck as DDT and Agent Orange.\\n\\n\\nGMOs have not been tested as much as they should. Even though they have had some testing, the results show that they should not have been put on the market. A study showed that when young rats were fed GM potatoes, they developed pre-cancerous cell growth, damaged immune systems, partial atrophy of the liver and an inhibited development of the brain, livers and testicles. Cows fed GM corn died. Twice the number of chickens died when fed GM corn compared to those fed natural corn. Soon after GM soy was introduced to the UK, soy allergies increased by 50%.\\n\\nThe European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong all have labeling laws for all GM food but The United Stated and Canada has not passed a law. 60 - 70% of the food in grocery stores in Canada is GM food. We need labeling for GM food so it is essential to get laws passed to get GM food labeled. The consequences are catastrophic to both humans and the environment if we continue eating GM food, but we need labeling laws to know if we are eating it or not.\\n\\nThe same biotech company, Monsanto, that makes Roundup Ready Soy, which is soy that is resistant to herbicides allowing you to use 70% more herbicides, produces and sells the herbicide Roundup used on those crops. Using more herbicides is dangerous due to biological amplification. The companies claim that GMO crops will not contain herbicides. That is true but the weeds will become immune to the amount of herbicide used making the farmer use more and more herbicides. Eventually the herbicide resistant gene will be passed onto weed relatives making herbicide-resistant super weeds. Round Up Ready crops will survive being sprayed with herbicides allowing farmers to use more herbicides. Monsanto makes 160 million gallons of Roundup herbicide a year. This amount of herbicides is extremely bad for the environment.\\n\\nIf biotech companies continue creating and using GM food, the GM food will take over all other natural crops and we can’t reverse this. So if these bio-tech companies produce a GM food that is deadly, causes cancer or makes us sick, there is no way to stop it. The only way to stop the creation of GM food is to know if we are eating it or not and the only way to know that is to have mandatory labeling laws. If most people stop eating GM food then the biotech companies would not produce it anymore. The biotech companies have no real knowledge of what effects this unnatural product can have on human health or the health of our planet. GMO companies are destroying our world and if we continue this we will have nothing left--[[User:Ryancragg|Ryancragg]] 14:17, 22 October 2005 (UTC)\\n==Image Tagging for [[:Image:Bohr2.gif]]==\\nThanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Bohr2.gif]]'''.

The purpose of the article in progress, "Celtic Music and American Identity", is to understand how layers of American Identity have been construed based on an influx of Celtic music. The article intends to inform on the diaspora of Celtic music to America in the 19th and 20th centuries and its effect on cultural and ideological aspects such as musical fusion (Celtic Rock, Celtic Punk, Celtic Pop, etc.) and social elements (i.e. tattoo art, festivals, pubs) that are now distinctly American. \\n\\nThis article is written based on guidelines and for fulfillment of the course 'Music in International Relations' at Denison University, Spring 2012. The course focuses on various topics in International Studies in relation to music, such as peace concerts, concert aesthetics, and the relationship between musical and social harmonies. Studies in History and Religion has inspired the topic of this article, in addition to an immersion in Scottish and Celtic culture.
''New data on Mars's underground ice shows that the red planet likely has a very active water cycle.  Using heat emission observations from the Mars Odyssey spacecraft, researchers were able to map seasonal changes in the temperature of the red planet's surface to locate and measure the buried ice.   "This gives us a more detailed picture of the underground ice on Mars," said Joshua Bandfield, a research specialist at Arizona State University's School of Earth and Space Exploration in Tempe, who led the study.  The findings, which are reported in the May 3 issue of the journal Nature, show that the depth of the water-ice table varies greatly on Mars.  The results also suggest that water ice and water vapor in the planet's atmosphere can swap places as the planet undergoes regular cycles of warming and cooling.
== History ==\\n\\nPanda Kitchen and Bath was established in 2000 by the Huang Family in Miami, Florida.  The Huang family had been in the cabinetry and granite business since the 1980s in mainland China.\\n\\nWhen the Huang family came to the U.S. in 1998, they purchased a home and visited their local retail store to inquire about kitchen and bath remodeling.  They found that their remodeling plans were out of reach; homeowners needed an average household income of over $80,000 to afford a kitchen and bath upgrade.\\n\\nWith their decades of experience in the construction industry behind them, the Huang family conducted research and discovered that they could cut the price of a kitchen and bath remodel project up to 70%, making the projects affordable to those with an average household income of $60,000.  This would open the opportunity to an additional 12-18% of customers that previously could not afford a kitchen and bath remodel.  And, they could do it with high-end materials.

Prior to this time, the style and traditions of the “ancien-regime” prevented the conceptualization of “the self”. Instead, one’s identity was considered malleable; subject to change depending on what clothes one was wearing. However, by the 1780’s, the new, “natural” style allowed one’s inner self to transcend their clothes (Wahrman).\\n\\nDuring the 1790s, there was a new concept of the internal and external self. Before this time, there had only been one self, which was expressed through clothing. When going to a masquerade ball, people wore specific clothing, so they could not show their individuality though their clothing. Since, for everyday dress, most people wore similar clothing, people used accessories to show their individuality. These accessories and the detail on the clothing were more important than the shape of the dress. (Wahrman)\\n\\nIncorporated in this new “natural” style was the importance of ease and comfort of ones dress. Not only was there a new emphasis on hygiene, but also clothing became much lighter and more able to be changed and washed frequently. Even upper class women began wearing cropped dresses as opposed to dresses with long trains or hoops that restricted them from leaving their homes. In a sense, women were influenced by male fashion, such as tailored waistcoats and jackets to emphasize women’s mobility. This new movement toward practicality of dress showed that dress no longer was a way to categorize between classes or genders; dress was meant to suit ones personal daily routine. (McNeil)

Vasari Plaster & Stucco manufactures and distributes plaster and stucco products. Vasari Plaster is a family owned business that started in 2003 in Bend, Oregon. In 2009 the factory and showroom relocated to Santa Barbara, California. They sell products premixed (wet mix) custom tinted, or ready to mix (dry mix). They ship products throughout North America and the world. Vasari is dedicated to producing the best possible wall finishes. Vasari is committed to environmental building practices. That is why they can help you achieve greater LEED points in buliding certification and most importantly give you the cleanest and freshest environment to play and work in. \\n\\nLime based wall finishes have been used for thousands of years. From the tombs of the Pyramids of Giza to the Sistine Chapel, lime stucco has been a key ingredient in great architecture on six continents for over 9000 years. Ancient Romans were thought to have perfected lime plasters to a higher art than previous cultures incorporating unlimited decorative elements. Fine plaster craft was lost for a thousand years until the Renaissance. Lime plasters were were widely recognized for their beauty, feel and longevity. Perhaps most importantly, it was the structural qualities that were most desired. Like Vasari products, lime plasters are breathable, water tolerant, absorb carbon dioxide, are naturally resistant to mildew and fungus, self healing on exteriors and easily repairable.\\n\\nOn June 6, 2011 Vasari's 5,000 square foot warehouse burned completely and the headquarters was moved a mile away. Vasari continues to thrive in Santa Barbara and hopes to replace all paint eventually with a much healthier and more beautiful alternative for all of us to live in.

Food insufficiency is a serious problem affecting children's ability to learn. Research indicates that school breakfast programs seem to improve attendance rates and decrease tardiness. Among severely undernourished populations, school breakfast programs seem to improve academic performance and cognitive functioning.\\nThe study seems to examine the relationship between academic of cognitive performance and eating breakfast in the morning. The author uses descriptive statistics in this study. The research was split into four different tables of data to show the results. The data was between children who took vitamins and ate breakfast and children who neither. They also used inferential statistics because they concluded the results based on a large group of children. The results describe the general performance of a student across a potentially wide range.\\n	The study seems to conclude that food insufficiency is a serious problem affecting children's ability to learn. School breakfast programs seem to improve attendance and decrease tardiness. Offering a healthy breakfast is an effective measure to improve academic performance and cognitive functioning among undernourished populations. Eating breakfast, in contrast to fasting, may improve performance on the morning eaten. Breakfast helps improve mental performance and concentration during morning activities. Children who skip breakfast will be more sluggish, less attentive, and have less energy to carry out their morning tasks. Teachers observe that children who come to school hungry experience more learning difficulties compared to well-nourished children. The study shows that breakfast eaters perform much better in their school work and show extra energy in sports and other physical activities. Besides assuring optimal development and growth, positive effects on alertness, attention, performance on standardized achievement tests, and other skills important for academic success are enhanced for those who eat breakfast on a daily basis. The long-term effects of eating breakfast on the performance of school children who do not have physical signs of severe undernourishment are less certain.
Hurricane Katrina: a severe natural disaster in North America in 2005:\\n	A natural disaster is an external environmental factor. The area where a natural disaster occurs has many effects and influences on different aspects of human lives. A hurricane is one of the external environmental factors of natural disasters. The hurricane is a storm formed over tropical oceans. It can spread over hundreds of thousands of square miles. The factors involved for generating a hurricane are ocean (warm surface water), rain (high humidity), winds from the same direction at a constant speed, and gravitational forces. Heat is extracted from the ocean and warm, moist air begins to rise. The moist air forms clouds and instability in the upper atmosphere and begins to spiral. The sea becomes turbulent because of the spiraling movement. Then a large amount of sea water is captured and suspended in the air. This situation increases the rate of evaporation and helps fuel the storm (Bradford and Carmichael, 2009, pp.167-168). A severe hurricane has a wind with a speed greater than 64 knots (74 miles per hour), according to the Beaufort scale. Generally, a hurricane originates in the tropical parts of the Atlantic Ocean or the Caribbean Sea. (thefreedictionary.com)\\nHurricane Katrina in 2005 in North America\\n	There were some fatal hurricanes in the past. One of the notable fatal hurricanes was hurricane Katrina. It happened from August 25 though September 2, 2005 in North America. The most affected areas were south Florida, the Florida Panhandle, coastal Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, particularly New Orleans. It was the second fatal disaster because of the hurricane after the 1900 Galveston hurricane and the costliest one in the U.S. history. About 2,000 people died and estimated property damaged was $75 billion in the event of hurricane Katrina (Shuman, 2007, p.265) whereas about 8000 people died in the event of 1900 Galveston hurricane (Larson, 1999, p.265). There are 5 categories of hurricane according to their storm intensity. The 5th category storm is a devastating, sustaining wind greater than 155 miles per hour. Hurricane Katrina was assessed as category 4 at landfall and the intensity of the storm reached category 5 level. Hurricane Katrina affected different aspects of lives in those affected areas and the USA as a whole (Bradford and Carmichael, 2007, P.175, volume 1). Hurricane Katrina affected many aspects which included economic, social, political, and governmental aspects of the USA.\\nGeneral economic effects during the year 2005\\n	Employees generally get their payment at the end of every month for their services. When hurricane Katrina occurred, many people were about to receive their payment at the end of the month from their employer. The storm struck at the end of August. They could not get their payment before the hurricane Katrina hit them. Therefore, most of them did not have enough money to arrange the rescue activities. They were compelled to live in their own places. In the hurricane Katrina event, most of the helpless people lost their lives (Shuman, 2007). Almost all of the industries, factories, farms, forests, roads, electricity, and businesses were either badly affected or destroyed entirely. During the year 2005 after the event, hundreds of thousands of local residents lost their jobs. Many insurance companies did not provide insurance in that area and some of the insurance companies raised their insurance premiums for houses, business activities and so on because of the high risk of fatal hurricane. Many people could not afford for the insurance premium. Therefore, people could not get insurance for the future risk. The economic activities became very slow. Because of the unemployment and destruction of industries, the financial activities were reduced sharply. As a result the government could not collect adequate taxes. Therefore, local government would not able to rebuild the infrastructure facilities in the state and the effected areas. The development activities in those areas in the year of the event were almost none. The priorities of the government were the rehabilitation of the affected people. The then government had sought for help billions of dollars for repairs and reconstruction in the region. The figure in terms of dollars of loss because of damages to the economy caused by destruction of infrastructure facilities was huge. The property damaged was about $ 89 billion (Burton and Hicks, 2005). Thus, the destruction of property and loss of lives burdened the state and federal government in many ways.  The extra burdens were to generate the employments, to rebuild the infrastructure facilities, to keep proper law and an ordered situation, and to develop the state(s) in all respects. \\nGeneral economic effects after 2005\\n	The economic factor plays a vital role in human lives. Political stability, health care issues, job market, industry growth, business growth, education and other societal aspects are greatly influenced by the economy of a country. We have seen many problems in the countries where the economic situation is not good enough. The root of the problems in other aspect of life is an economic factor. The natural disaster first affects the economic sector. The hurricane Katrina badly affected the economic sector as well as took the lives of many people. Therefore, there were many problems after the Katrina event. Many obstacles emerged in rebuilding the economy of the disaster area. Hurricane Katrina caused short as well as long term economic impacts to the federal and state governments. Federal government had to allocate extra budget for rebuilding and developing those areas. For that purpose, the government needed extra funds. The government had to raise funds either increasing its debt capital (issuing government bonds), or increasing the taxes. It was extra burden to the people and government. Therefore, financial activities were not satisfactory in the areas where major destructions occurred. As a result of slow financial activities, development activities could not accelerate. This situation created many problems in the people’s lives and corporate operations. It will take a long time for the recovery of the wounds because of the fatal destruction of property and life.\\nMoreover, the recent financial market crash added another problem to people and corporations who were severely affected because of the natural disaster. Therefore, hurricane Katrina will have the negative impacts in many years’ in future in finance, infrastructure and development sectors.\\nInternal politics\\n	Hurricanes can not be prevented. Therefore, necessary steps need to be taken to avoid the loss of life and property. The state government of Louisiana declared a state of emergency on August 26. The then Governor Kathleen Blanco of Louisiana requested federal government to provide National Guard troops to help meet the emergency. Governor Haley Barbour of Mississippi and Governor Bob Riley of Alabama also declared a state of emergency. The governor of Louisiana asked then President George W. Bush to declare a federal state of emergency in his state. However, The White House gave the authority to the department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to respond on the emergencies due to hurricane. After the event, local and state agencies responded in an efficient manner as compare to federal government (Shuman, 2007). The state and federal governments were not well prepared for the emergency management, environmental policy, poverty and unemployment. The storms’ devastation prompted the political reactions. The ruling party lost its popularity. Federal government’s ruling Republican Party reached at the lowest point of popularity. Then President George W. Bush was blamed for lack of leadership. The delayed response to the fatal disaster of federal government and lack of emergency management raised the issue of racism. The majority of victims of hurricane Katrina were African-American. They were low income people. These victims spent more time in temporary shelters and were more vulnerable to permanent displacement as compared to middle-income and white people (Bullard and Wright, 2009, p.4). Because of this reason, the issue of race immerged quickly. African American people perceived that the federal government did not response immediately with the purpose because the disaster area was the black dominated area. Such thinking was extremely bad for the harmony of the society. \\nAs we mentioned earlier, the government was not prepared for such of huge destruction. Because of that reason, rescue operation after the terrible destruction was not efficient and got the criticism from different angles. Politicians tried to grab political gain taking the advantage of the vulnerable situation. It resulted on the loss for the ruling party and a huge gain for the opposition party. This became a permanent reputation loss of then administration and the republican. The opposition did not get the criticism. The then opposition party gained the political arena because of the political image loss of the ruling party. This has been a short term as well as a long term gain to the then opposition party. It needed extra time and efforts to understand the reality. However, this factor contributed to the greater political impact to the politicians and people in general. \\nExternal politics\\n	Hurricane Katrina drew the attention of the politicians at the world wide level because of the rescue operation and crisis management after the tragic event. The minority community and economically marginalized people of the affected area were worried for their future settlement since they could not do anything without proper help. Many issues were raised because of the vulnerable situation and its settlement. Because of the mismanagement of the prices of goods, services and reconstruction activities skyrocketed. Ehrlich Howard J. in his book “Hate Crimes and Ethnoviolence” quoted that “Americans spent $ 10 billion more over the week on energy than they did a year ago in the same week”(Ehrlich, 2009). People could hardly afford for the price of goods and service. \\nAnother issue was about the external help. For the immediate response to the hurricane Katrina victims, Cuban President Fidel Castro proposed for the help to US 1,586 disaster-trained physicians and 26 tons of medical supplies and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez proposed for cheap gasoline and humanitarian supplies (Ehrlich, 2009, P. 131). Because of the proximity, they could provide their assistance within few hours and lives of hundreds of injured people could be saved. But, White House rejected the humanitarian assistance. Many human lives could be saved and many peoples in trouble would get help. Because of the White House decision, general people perceived that then government ignored the sensitivity of the injured people because of its own political reasons” (Ehrlich, 2009). Without change in our behavior and thinking, we can not survive in this changing world. History has proved that without change according to the need of time, level of thinking of people and environment, nobody, no system and no civilization can survive in this changing world. Everything is possible but it is the matter of time and the environment. \\nSocio-psychological \\n	The badly affected area because of hurricane Katrina was New Orleans of Louisiana. The majority of residents in the New Orleans were African Americans. The majority of victims were black people. Moreover, people who were old, with ill health, children and poor who did not have vehicles to leave their places were the victims of the storms and floods. People surviving from the disaster were waiting for the food and water for five days. The rescue operation was delayed because of the lack of proper planning and management of rescue operations. The survivors were surrounded by dead bodies and sewage. The police protection, help and rescue operation were not implemented in time (Bassett, 2009). \\nThe government’s slow response raised the question of its intention.  That horrifying situation helped to raise the issue of race. The psychological impact was that the rescue operations were not enough and were bias because of race. The delay rescue operation had been another subject matter to carry out the truth before the public to maintain the harmonize relationship among the different groups in the society. Many people believe there was a need to harmonize the relationship but not fuel the issue of race which emerged during that period (Bullard and Wright, 2009).\\nSocial security\\n	The security situation in the New Orleans aftermath was very poor. People started looting in the stores after the hurricane moved away. Many helpless people were searching for food and water. Reports in the flood news were carjacking, murders, thefts and rapes. Some news was inaccurate because of confusion. To handle the situations, thousands of troops were deployed in the affected areas. Many arrests were made in the suspicion of improper activities in those areas. Criminal background checks on the refugees were conducted. Some people were sent to jail to maintain the law and order situation in that area (Shuman, 2007). In short, government was able to keep the law and order situation in the area despite the discrepancies on its rescue operation and emergency management. \\n Government’s efforts\\n	There were controversies on the news. Government had arranged to give immediate relief to the victims at its own pace. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) issued debit cards so that holders could purchase their daily needs without delay. Some of the debit cards were procured with fraudulently by the people. They were using false social security numbers who have died or they knew by any other means, false identifications to obtain the debit cards. The cards were used to pay luxury vacations and other illegal payment (Bradford and Carmichael, 2007, p.960). \\nFurther, government responded for rebuilding the city and disaster area because of the political reason. It was criticized that rebuilding the city was not wise enough because many people lost their lives, a lot property was destroyed and there is still high risk of Natural disasters in future. The government has been facing continuing problems for settling houses, employment, developing corporations, poverty, environmental policy issues and emergency management in those areas (Shuman, 2007). Therefore, government should seek alternative ways to settle the people of high natural disaster risk areas. \\nConclusion\\n	The rescue operation after the hurricane Katrina raised many issues. Similarly, the disaster left many negative impacts on the lives of people, and in political, social, and economical aspects. However, the problems and issues rose during or after the disaster helped to think and behave in a particular ways. Right decisions in time, early preparation for crisis management, planning for future development, adequate precautions for security of people and property, political and social movement, mutual respect among different beliefs, harmonize relationship among different groups of society could be overlooked otherwise in future in the very situation. Therefore, post and pre hurricane Katrina situations will be a proper path for future precautions. In the given scenario of the hurricane Katrina, the government should take appropriate steps to settle the people, and corporations in the safe zone. Moreover, we need to behave with people according to the new spirit and knowledge of 21st century era. Government should use the natural resources in such a way so that the loss of human resources and corporate property would be minimal. For example, Louisiana can be used to raise the forest and forest Industry. People living in Louisiana should be transferred to other safe states or areas. We should develop the education, health, finance, farms, and other businesses activities in relatively safe areas from natural catastrophes. We should use our land, forest, water and other natural resources optimally for the human beings and for the best interest of the nation. We have to rethink about the reconstruction program and should take the appropriate decision for the welfare of the people now and in future.\\n\\n\\nReferences\\nShuman, R. B.

Many of the most difficult and pressing issues faced by society—how to mitigate and adapt to climate change and sea-level rise, how to manage the effects of ocean acidification, and how best to conserver marine resources and biodiversity—cannot be addressed effectively without improved understanding of Southern Ocean processes and feedbacks and their sensitivity to change. The most urgent research challenges in the Southern Ocean often span traditionally separate scientific disciplines. The SOOS will facilitate and enhance current observation efforts to provide the sustained, integrated, multi-disciplinary observations required to meet these challenges.\\n\\n\\n'''Scientific Rationale'''\\nThe Southern Ocean is fundamental to the operation of Planet Earth as we know it. It is the central connection between the major ocean basins, and between the upper and lower layers of the global ocean circulation. It exerts a major influence on global climate, and on planetary-scale biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems (see e.g., Rintoul et al. 2001, Sarmiento et al., 2004; le Quere et al., 2007; Meredith et al., 2012). The Southern Ocean is changing rapidly, with profound global ramifications. These changes include a large-scale warming that exceeds the global average, including several “hotspots” of extreme regional warming (Böning et al, 2008; Gille, 2008). Both upper and lower limbs of the Southern Ocean overturning have freshened, due to changes in the hydrological cycle and ice melt (Böning et al, 2008). The rate at which the Southern Ocean can draw down anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere has likely weakened (Meredith et al. 2012), though acidification is already underway with strong implications for marine species and populations (Rintoul et al., 2012). The climatic changes are already impacting on the functioning of the Southern Ocean ecosystems (Schofield et al., 2010), with implications for some commercially important species. The critical need to observe and understand the Southern Ocean is thus well established, however the harsh conditions and remote location has led to it being the most under-sampled region of the world. Sustained, multidisciplinary observations are required to detect, interpret and respond to the physical, chemical and biological changes occurring.\\n\\nMore information on the scientific rationale and implementation strategy of the SOOS can be found in the <ref>''Southern Ocean Observing System: Initial Science and Implementation Strategy''</ref>, which is available for download from the SOOS website (www.soos.aq)\\n\\n\\n'''Sponsors'''\\nThe SOOS is an initiative of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR). The SOOS is endorsed by the Partnership for Observation of the Global Oceans (POGO), the "Climate Variability" (CLIVAR) project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), and "Climate and the Cryosphere" (CliC).\\n\\nThe SOOS International Project Office is hosted by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania, Australia.

''''''ECHO FRIEND INDUSTRIES''''''\\n\\n''About e-Waste''\\n "Electronic waste" may be defined as all secondary computers, entertainment device electronics, mobile phones, and other items such as television sets and refrigerators, whether sold, donated, or discarded by their original owners. This definition includes used electronics which are destined for reuse, resale, salvage, recycling, or disposal. Others define the re-usables (working and repairable electronics) and secondary scrap (copper, steel, plastic, etc.) to be "commodities", and reserve the term "waste" for residue or material which was represented as working or repairable but which is dumped or disposed or discarded by the buyer rather than recycled, including residue from reuse and recycling operations. Because loads of surplus electronics are frequently commingled (good, recyclable, and non-recyclable), several public policy advocates apply the term "e-waste" broadly to all surplus electronics. The Environmental Protection Act (EPA) includes discarded CRT monitors in its category of "hazardous household waste" but considers CRTs set aside for testing to be commodities if they are not discarded, speculatively accumulated, or left unprotected from weather and other damage.\\n\\nDebate continues over the distinction between "commodity" and "waste" electronics definitions. Some exporters are accused of deliberately leaving difficult-to-recycle, obsolete, or non-repairable equipment mixed in loads of working equipment (though this may also come through ignorance, or to avoid more costly treatment processes). Protectionists may broaden the definition of "waste" electronics in order to protect domestic markets from working secondary equipment. The high value of the computer recycling subset of electronic waste (working and reusable laptops, desktops, and components like RAM) can help pay the cost of transportation for a larger number of worthless pieces than can be achieved with display devices, which have less (or negative) scrap value.
\\n== '''A simple approach to terrorism''' by Dr.Tammam Ali AlBarmaki\\n\\n\\n'''Terrorism''' is the use of force or violence against persons or property for the\\npurpose of intimidation, coercion, or ransom. Terrorists often use\\nviolence and threats to create fear among the public, to try to convince\\npeople that their government is powerless to prevent acts of terrorism,\\nand to get immediate publicity for their causes.  Acts of terrorism can range\\nfrom threats to actual assassinations, kidnappings,building explosions, mailings of dangerous materials, agro- terrorism, computer-based attacks, and the use of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons—weapons of mass destruction (WMD). \\n\\n'''Another type is called hand-made terrorism''' which is utilized very perfectly in order to draw the attention of the strong nations and subsequently received support from them, this type is also described as seasonal terrorism and it is of two subtypes either primary that was not there before or secondary which is already existing and weak but is aggravated or stimulated by the government. And the cause for its aggravation or stimulation is either due to the government does not receive any support (any form of support) from those donor countries or the support which was done by these donor countries is now stopped. It seems that there is some agreement between the two parts, the government and the terrorist groups and the answer is Yes in the former and may be in the later.\\n\\nPeople face threats of terrorism posed by extremist groups, individuals, and hostile governments. Terrorists can be domestic or foreign, and their threats to people, communities, and the nation range from isolated acts of terrorism to acts of war. High-risk terrorism targets include military and civilian government facilities, international airports, large cities, and high-profile landmarks. Terrorists might also target large public gatherings, water and food supplies, utilities, and corporate centers. People become terrorist in different ways, in different roles, and for different reasons. Mental illness is not a contributing factor to these terrorist processes, it means that those terrorists are not psychopaths and there is not terrorist personality. History of childhood trauma , abuse, and themes of perceived injustice and humiliation  may make the person susceptible to be a terrorist but do not really help to explain terrorism. Terrorist groups, like all social collectives, have certain internal (e.g., mistrust, competition) and external (e.g. support, inter-group conflict) vulnerabilities to their existence. \\n\\nEffective leaders of terrorist organizations must be able to: maintain a collective belief system; establish and maintain organizational routines; control the flow of communication; manipulate incentives (and purposive goals) for followers; deflect conflict to external targets; and keep action going. \\n  \\nWe must know that terrorism is not an official state by itself otherwise it is called violence. In many Arab countries and in this current political situation and the spring of the ongoing Arab masses revolution. The acts done by the government against the protesters such as attacking them by any form as shooting them, poisoning them with poisonous weapons, or arresting them are not involved in the definition of terrorism, instead it is called violence against humanity and the innocents. I will not go deeply through this path but I try to concentrate hardly on the prevention and role of the governments in fighting terrorism.\\n\\n\\nJerrold Post has similarly theorized that “the need to belong, the need to have a stable identity, to resolve a split and be at one with oneself and with society- … is an important bridging concept which helps explain the similarity in behavior of terrorists in groups of widely different espoused motivations and composition.” \\n\\nBecause of the malicious behaviors and intentions of those terrorist groups all nations and states world wide stand together for fighting terrorism in all its forms.\\n\\n\\nThe United State and the European Unions play a major role in fighting terrorism through their partnership.\\nSince the end of the Cold War, the role of non-state actors forming transnational networks and adopting the methods of political violence associated with low intensity conflict and insurgency (e.g., bombings, kidnapping, assassinations, hostage taking, etc.) has increased, especially in geographic regions where governance is weak or non-existent.\\nThe American strategy has four main components to limit and fight terrorism:\\n\\n'''Defeat''' terrorist organizations of global reach; \\n\\n'''Deny''' further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists; \\n\\n'''Diminish''' underlying conditions that terrorists seek to exploit; \\n\\n'''Defend''' the homeland and extend defenses abroad.\\n\\n\\nAlso the European Union has its four main components to limit and fight terrorism:\\n\\n \\n\\n'''Prevent''' people turning to terrorism by tackling root causes; \\n\\n'''Protect''' citizens and infrastructure; \\n\\n'''Pursue''' and investigate terrorists and bring them to justice; \\n\\n'''Respond''' (prepare) to manage and minimize consequences of an attack\\n\\n\\nFirst the US sees the fight against terrorism as a "war". Consequently, there has been a heavy input from the Defense Department and armed forces in disrupting terrorist networks. As the State Department’s legal advisor has argued: \\n\\n[The United States was] clearly justified in using military force in self-defense against al-Qaida. Al-Qaida is not a nation state, but it planned and executed violent attacks with an international reach, magnitude, and sophistication that could previously be achieved only by nation states. Its leaders explicitly declared war against the United States, and al-Qaida members attacked our embassies, our military vessels, our financial center, our military headquarters, and our capital city, killing more than 3,000 people in the process. In our view, these facts fully supported our determination that we were justified in responding in self-defense, just as we would have been if a nation had committed these acts against us.\\n\\n\\nSecond, the US approach places an emphasis on the external. For the United States, the extraterritorial nature of the al-Qaida network (not to mention the Taliban government in Afghanistan, which harbored al-Qaida terrorists) led the Americans to view the threat’s external dimension. Consequently, the US approach consistently has been to “take the fight” to the enemy and push the borders out.\\nAs Dan Hamilton writes, “Despite the impact of September 11 on the United States, the natural instinct in a nation bounded by two oceans is still to fight one’s enemies abroad so one doesn’t need to fight them at home.” Thus, the focus of the American counterterrorism strategy has been to reach out to beyond Europe to the rest of world, including the Philippines, Russia, China, Pakistan, India, and Australia. As the National Counterterrorism Strategy states, “As our enemies exploit the benefits of our global environment to operate around the world, our approach must be global as well.” This is one reason why the US developed the Container Security Initiative.\\n\\n\\nThird, the US approach has been proactive. From an institutional perspective, the US created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and implemented major reform of the Intelligence Community in order to be better prepared for future threats.\\nEven if transatlantic threat perceptions vary somewhat, American and European officials generally agree on the threat and that it is real. A cursory comparison of the US national security strategy and EU security strategies is a case in point. According to the 2002 US National Security Strategy, global terrorism is a major threat to democratic regimes and the civilized world. The European Security Strategy of December 2003 lists terrorism as one of five key threats to the EU. The attacks in Madrid and London have helped European governments recognize that they are not immune. European intelligence officials believe that as many as thirty “spectacular” attacks have been planned since September 11. In October 2006, EU officials conducted a mock exercise to test their preparedness for a wave of terrorist attacks. In the exercise scenario, officials had to respond to a near-simultaneous terrorist attack in five EU cities. The purpose was to see how well EU institutions such as the Commission and Council Secretariat coordinate their various responses. According to Commission officials, the EU’s joint capacity was pretty good, although a review of the exercise highlighted the need for better use of communication technology. In March 2007, Europol released its first EU terrorism trends report, which stated that the terrorist threat to the EU is “more serious than ever.”\\nOne proposal put forward by the Europeans was to develop a “non-emotive lexicon” for discussing issues “in order to avoid linking Islam to terrorism.” Yet, in the same paragraph, the EU strategy talks about encouraging the “emergence of European imams” and engaging with “Muslim organizations and faith groups that reject the distorted version of Islam put forward by al-Qaida and others.”\\n\\n\\nThere is a strong link between the US department, EU department and the other government in the world for the purpose of fighting terrorism in all its forms either providing the government with any form of support to fight the terrorism by its own way or sharing the weak nations for fighting terrorism by military forces.\\n\\n\\nI would like to emphasize that terrorism is like HIV/AIDS, once some body is infected with it he /she will be exposed to many threats such as decrease his/her immunity and appearance of other infections and cancers which are the most common cause for death in patients infected with HIV. Likely the nations that are attacked by terrorism will be weak and said to be powerless if not all people stand together against this threat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'''References:\\n1.

'''Hippahauchi Mountain Lions'''\\n\\nThe Hippahauchi Mountain Lions are native to California. They are powerful, feline predator that had a spiritual connection with the indigenous tribes. It is said that the Hippahauchi Mountain Lions only reside in areas that previously belonged to the indian tribes of Northern California. As early American Settlers migrated in search of gold in the mid 1800's, the pioneers killed off the entire tribe. The last tribal chief made a pact with the Hippahauchi Mountain Lions to seek revenge on the white man. The most dangerous part about the predators is that you cannot feel your limbs being eaten away. You must check your arms and legs every morning when you wake up. Their ferocious attacks left thousands dead. To this day the government tries to keep this dangerous animal a secret to prevent a state of fear among the people. The government denies the existence of this animal and no pictures are available. '''BEWARE OF BEING FOUND IN WHITE OR ORANGE TENTS IN THE OUTDOORS!!!'''
== [[Media:Irish Pauper Flu \\n ==]\\n\\nIrish Pauper Flu has been confirmed in Ireland.  It is much more aggressive than Swine flu and has extremely consequences for the Irish Nation. \\n\\n Symptoms include: Panic attacks, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, hot flushes, depressive episodes, suicidal thoughts, migraine level headaches, loss of appetite, life threatening bouts of colic. (All age groups are vunerable)\\n\\nLong term symptoms include:  Loss of vision, manic depression, chronic pain, immobility, leper syndrome, Pauper lifestyle.\\nIrish Government has commissioned NAMA to deliver vaccine but have warned the Irish people that costs will reach to approx 50 Billion Euro and cure for virus not guaranteed. Government assured Irish taxpayers that NAMA in everyone’s best interest and should be paid for by 3010. \\n\\n The Irish Government further stated that Developers and Banks delighted to assist and co-operate with NAMA.  Experts divided on NAMA but other experts have concluded that this particular strain of Irish Pauper Flu has not been recorded sine the 1850s/60’s Famine periods in Ireland during which estimated 1,0000000 (million) Irish people lost their lives while millions more Paupered.

== tornadoinsight ==\\n\\nA tornado is a violently rotating column of air which is in contact with both a cumulonimbus cloud base and the ground on earth. Only in rare cases is it made with a cumulus cloud. Tornadoes can come in many sizes, but are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, with the narrow end touching the ground. Most tornadoes have winds of 110 miles per hour or less. They are about 250 feet across, and travel a few miles before dissipating. Some tornadoes can have winds of 300 miles per hour, and can be more than a mile across. They have recorded tornadoes on every continent except for Antarctic. On an average year, there are about 800 tornadoes that cause about 80 deaths and around 1500 injuries. Once a tornado in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, carried a motel sign 30 miles and dropped it in Arkansas! They develop in warm, moist air most of the time.
Protein Translation Engineering. The process of manipulating DNA code and conditions which affect the interaction of mRNA at the ribosome level to link amino acids together to form proteins. This process can include, but is not limited to silent changes or changes which substitute or delete amino acids from the final protein. In addition to direct manipulation of DNA code, translation engineering can be controlled and effected by changing the environment in which the the DNA message interacts with the ribosome. This can include but is not limited to, temperature, the abundance (or lack thereof) of key tRNAs, induction times and a variety of other factors including choice of cell line for protein express.\\n\\nSilent changes and translation engineering\\nDNA interacts with the ribosome, three letters at a time. These three letters or triplets are called "codons". All of the millions proteins in every living thing are composed of amino acids, the essential building blocks of life. For each amino acid, multiple codons exist, each
GenF20 HGH human growth hormone releaser is natural agents that can promote the enhanced production of HGH from the pituitary gland.\\n\\nLive like a Younger Person with Human Growth Hormone Supplements like Genf20-\\n\\nLevels of Human Growth Hormone decrease as we age. By middle age and beyond HGH levels have plummeted to a tiny fraction of their youthful levels. Science shows that there is a direct correlation between lost HGH and the troubles we all dread most, such as weight gain, loss of interest in sex, sagging skin and muscles, wrinkled skin that lacks good tone and texture, flagging memory… HGH is the incredibly exciting answer!\\nNow you can help increase the levels of Human Growth Hormone your own body secretes. Scientific research, extensive product development and real-life proven trials now bring you GenF20 HGH pure Human Growth Hormone releaser ... "Best Overall Health Tonic and Rejuvenator EVER".\\nAs we get older, our body begins to produce less human growth hormone. This is when our ages really catch up to us. It may happen more quickly in some people than it does in others, but it nevertheless does happen to all of us. As such, that is why so many people begin putting on weight when they hit middle age. They may experience insomnia and mood swings, and often find that their muscle strength is rapidly decreasing. This can not be quite devastating, as you can easily imagine - nor does it stop there ... although it can, if you are willing to do something about it.\\n\\nDue to its vast benefits, GenF20 has become very popular among aging adults. These benefits of GenF20 includes...\\n\\n•	Low level of body fat\\n•	Lean muscle mass\\n•	Wrinkle reduction\\n•	Hair restoration\\n•	Lower cholesterol\\n•	Increase sexual stamina\\n•	Normalize blood pressure\\n•	Better brain, vision and immune system\\n\\nIn addition to the superb benefits brought by Gen F20 and supplements, moody, aging individuals who have sleeping difficulties can experience improvements on these problems once they take HGH supplements or undergo HGH treatments.\\n\\nAbout the Author: John writes about topics that matter to people and can make a difference in their lives.

== Crops ==\\n\\nRice is the most important cereal crop. In 1966 total rice production amounted to a little more than 1 million tons; by 1989 more than 3 million tons were produced.[1] Fluctuation in rice production was very common because of changes in rainfall; overall, however, rice production had increased following the introduction of new cultivation techniques as well as increases in cultivated land. By 1988 approximately 3.9 million hectares of land were under paddy cultivation.[1] Many people in Nepal devote their lives to cultivating rice to survive. In 1966 approximately 500,000 tons of corn, the second major food crop, were produced. By 1989 corn production had increased to over 1 million tons.[1]\\n\\n \\nA Nepalese coffee growerOther food crops included wheat, millet, barley, and coffee, but their contribution to the agricultural sector was small.[1] Increased production of cash crops, used as input to new industries, dominated in the early 1970s. Sugarcane and tobacco also showed considerable increases in production from the 1970s to the l980s. Potatoes and oilseed production had shown moderate growth since 1980. Medicinal herbs were grown in the north on the slopes of the Himalayas, but increases in production were limited by continued environmental degradation. According to government statistics, production of milk, meat, and fruit had improved but as of the late 1980s still had not reached a point where nutritionally balanced food was available to most people. Additionally, the increases in meat and milk production had not met the desired level of output as of 1989. Nepal has more than 50% of people engaged in agriculture. Food grains contributed 76 percent of total crop production in 1988-89. In 1989-90 despite poor weather conditions and a lack of agricultural inputs, particularly fertilizer, there was a production increase of 5 percent. In fact, severe weather fluctuations often affected production levels.[1] Some of the gains in production through the 1980s were due to increased productivity of the work force (about 7 percent over fifteen years); other gains were due to increased land use and favorable weather conditions. According to Statistical Information on Nepalese Agriculture (2008/2009) only 65.6% of people depends on agriculture and 21% of land is cultivated whereas 6.99% of land is uncultivated\\n     WRITTEN BY~ PRATIK BAHADUR ADHIKARI
== Save Your Planet through Metal Recycling ==\\n\\n“Two-thirds of the aluminum ever produced is still in use today” (earth911.com)<br />\\n“All steel cans are 100% recyclable” (wasteonline.org.uk)\\n\\nWhen you think of metal recycling, aluminum and steel is what generally comes to mind. But regretfully the fact of the matter is that the recycling rates of these 2 metals have been reduced by 20% over the past couple of years. Both aluminum scrap and steel scrap have a high recycling value. Thus the more these 2 metals are recycled at metal recycling companies, the more money and energy can be saved.\\n\\nHow products are made directly from ores (without recycling):\\n\\n• An ALUMINUM product is made by separating oxygen from aluminum extracted as a mineral. This is done by the application of an electric current that is passed through the metal.

Thorfinn Stainforth\\nDr. Hanlon\\nHanlon Research Paper II\\nMarch 10, 2003\\n\\nFamine in 17th Century Europe\\n	Famine had been a regular, unwelcome, occurrence in Europe for centuries before the seventeenth century. The cycle of good harvests, poor harvests and the resulting periods plenty, scarcity, or famine are a part of every peasant society. During the seventeenth century, in parts of Europe, this cycle began to end. Famines continued to recur regularly in most areas of Europe long after the seventeenth century, but in some areas they began to disappear in that century. This remarkable change was the result of improved agricultural techniques and the increasingly commercialized nature of agriculture in Europe. In areas where famines did still occur, a variety of social and governmental measures were used to mitigate the effects of those tough times.\\n	Agriculture dominated the European economy in the seventeenth century. The vast majority of the population was involved in the production and distribution of food.1 Most people on the continent were still subsistence level peasants.2 Although the economy was beginning to become more commercialized, as we shall see, most people still produced food for themselves and their landlord.\\n	Agriculture was dominated by the production of grain. A typical craftsman in the Low Countries around 1600 spent about 1/2 of his income on grain or bread.3 Grain was used to make bread which provided the bulk of almost every meal. There were many different kinds of grain produced, varying depending on the local climate and culture. Wheat was the most prized grain, due to its taste, texture, and colour, but it was generally unavailable to northern Europeans who had to settle for rye, oats, or a combination of grains. Wheat was not particularly more nutritious than either of these grains, and many northerners continued to prefer their traditional grains long after they were able to grow wheat reliably. Naturally, with such a dependence on grain, a poor harvest of the local staple grain could easily lead to famine. Many areas were heavily dependent on the one type of grain they chose to rely on, and were thus extremely vulnerable to crop failures.4 \\n	In some areas a dual crop system was developed that helped to alleviate some of the problems of over-reliance on one kind of grain. Wheat and rye were planted in autumn, harvested the next summer, while barley and oats could be planted in spring and harvested in autumn. If one crop failed, the other had the possibility of sustaining the population for the time it took to harvest another crop.5 Usually barley and oats were not so much grown for their bread making qualities, but in the case of barley for making drink, and in the case of oats to feed the livestock. Other refinements of agriculture helped to alleviate famine or dearth, but did not usually prevent it.\\n	Improvements in the field rotation system allowed peasants to use their land more frequently and efficiently . The “three field” system was adopted in many areas, an improvement over the medieval “two field” system. New crops were introduced from the Americas and elsewhere. Maize and potatoes were the most notable of the new crops. Maize was first introduced in the 1550s, but it took some time for it to become widely accepted.6 Maize was an extremely versatile crop and was eventually able to feed peasants even in the years with the worst harvests. In the course of the seventeenth century, potatoes also came into wide use. They were a phenomenon of northern Europe, and came to be the staple crop of the peasantry and urban poor.7 \\n	Fruits and vegetables were not well regarded by most of the population. However, during the seventeenth century they came to be eaten on a much more regular basis than they had previously, possibly as a result of the increased population of the time. Beans, cabbage, leeks, peas, sorrel, lettuce, endive, onions, melons, pumpkins, cucumbers, parsnips, carrots, cabbage, turnips, apples, pears, plums, cherries, and in some areas peaches, oranges, and lemons came to be eaten on a regular basis during the seventeenth century.8 Meat was available in northern Europe primarily in spring and autumn, the two slaughtering periods. Fish was available in areas close to the coasts, or on rivers with relatively quick access to the sea.\\n	The seventeenth century was a period of change for the food producers of Europe. For centuries they had lived primarily as subsistence farmers in a feudal system. They had obligations to their lords, who usually owned the land they worked. They shared the food that they produced with the lord in exchange for the use of the land. Peasants generally tried to minimize the amount of work they had to put into agricultural food production. Their lords rarely pressured them to increase their food output, except when the population started to increase, at which time the peasants were likely to increase the production themselves. More land would be added to cultivation until there was no more available and the peasants were forced to take up more labour intensive methods of production. None the less, they generally tried to work as little as possible, valuing their time to do other things such as hunting, fishing, or relaxing, as long as they had enough food to sustain their population.9 It was not in their interest to produce more than they could eat or store themselves.\\n	During the seventeenth century, continuing the trend of previous centuries, there was in increase in market driven agriculture. Farmers, people who rented land in order to make a profit off of the product of the land, employing wage labour, became increasingly common, particularly in western Europe. It was in their interest to produce as much as possible on their land in order to sell it to areas that demanded that product. They produced guaranteed surpluses of their crop every year if they could.10 Farmers paid their labourers in money, increasing the commercialization of rural society. This monetization had a profound impact on the behaviour of peasants. Farmers were interested in increasing labour input into their lands, not decreasing it as subsistence peasants were.\\n	Subsistence peasants were also increasingly forced to commercialize their activities because of increasing taxes. Taxes that had to be paid to central governments in money forced the peasants to produce crops to sell. Sometimes they produced industrial crops, but often they would find ways to increase their production in order to meet both their subsistence requirements as well as their tax obligations.11 Peasants also often used the new money to purchase manufactured goods.\\n	The agricultural and social developments encouraging increased food production were gradually taking place throughout the sixteenth century, but were spurred on more directly by the adverse conditions for food production that Europe found itself in in the early seventeenth century. There was a general cooling trend in the Earth’s temperature starting at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The 1590s saw the worst famines in centuries all across Europe, except in certain areas, notably the Netherlands.12 Famine had been relatively rare during the sixteenth century. The economy and population had grown steadily as subsistence populations tend to when there is an extended period of relative peace (most of the time). Subsistence peasant populations will almost always increase when possible since the peasants will try to spread the work to as many hands as possible.13  Although peasants in areas of high population density, such as northern Italy, had learned to increase the yields of their lands through techniques such as promiscuous culture,14  they were still often quite vulnerable to famines, forcing them to work their land even more intensively.\\n	Famine was a very destabilizing and devastating occurrence. The prospect of starvation led people to take desperate measures. When scarcity of food became apparent to peasants, they would sacrifice long term prosperity for short term survival. They would kill their draught animals, leading to lowered production in subsequent years. They would eat their seed corn, sacrificing next year’s crop in the hope that more seed could be found. Once those means had been exhausted, they would take to the road in search of food. They generally migrated to the cities where merchants from other areas would be more likely to sell their food. Cities had a stronger purchasing power than did rural areas.15 Cities also administered relief programs and bought grain for their populations so that they could keep order.16 With the confusion and desperation of the migrants, crime would often follow them. Many peasants resorted to banditry in order to acquire enough to eat. The countrysides and cities were especially dangerous in times of dearth or famine.\\n	There was little direct relationship between famine and disease.17 It has often been assumed that disease was directly related to periods of hunger, but Schofield believes that the two blights were generally unrelated, except as an extension of extended social disorder. None the less, famines were obviously extremely difficult times for the population. One famine would often lead to difficulties in following years because of lack of seed stock or disruption of routine, or perhaps because of less available labour. Famines were often interpreted as signs of God’s displeasure.18 They were seen as the removal, by God, of His gifts to the people of the Earth. Elaborate religious processions and rituals were  made to prevent God’s wrath in the form of famine.19 \\n	The great famine of the 1590s began the period of famine and decline in the seventeenth century. The price of grain, all over Europe was high, as was the population. Various types of people were vulnerable to the succession of bad harvests that occurred throughout the 1590s in different regions. The increasing number of wage labourers in the countryside were vulnerable because they had no food of their own, and their meager living was not enough to purchase the expensive grain of a bad crop year. Town labourers were also at risk because their wages would be insufficient to cover the cost of grain, and to make matters worse, they often received less money in bad crop years since the disposable income of the wealthy was spent on grain. Often unemployment would be the result of the increase in grain prices, leading to ever increasing numbers of urban poor. All areas of Europe were badly affected by the famine in these periods, especially rural areas.\\n	The Netherlands were able to escape most of the damaging effects of the famine, though the 1590s were still difficult years there. Van Deursen, a Dutch historian wrote, \\n\\nactual famine did not occur, for the Amsterdam grain trade [with the Baltic] guaranteed that there would always be something to eat in Holland... In Holland and in the Republic as a whole, people did not die of hunger... [though] dearth could become quite fearsome.20\\n\\n	The Netherlands had the most commercialized agriculture in all of Europe at this time. They grew many industrial crops such as flax, hemp, and hops. Agriculture became increasingly specialized and efficient. The efficiency of Dutch agriculture allowed for much more rapid urbanization in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries than anywhere else in Europe. As a result, productivity and wealth increased, allowing the Netherlands to maintain a steady food supply.21 By the 1620s the economy was even more developed, so the country was able to avoid the hardships of that period of famine with even greater impunity.\\n	The years around 1620 saw another period of famines sweep across Europe. These famines were generally less severe than the famines of twenty five years earlier, but they were none the less quite devastating in many areas. The harvest failures were devastating for the northern Italian economy. The economy of the area had recovered well from the previous famines, but the famines from 1618-21 coincided because of a period of war in the area. The economy did not recover fully for centuries.22 The economic downturn left the area less able to deal with famine than other areas such as the Netherlands. Italian agriculture began to lag behind Dutch agriculture in terms of commercial development and Italy continued to suffer from famines throughout the seventeenth century. There were serious famines in the late 1640s and less severely in the 1670s throughout northern Italy. Local famines continued to occur throughout the period, but were less devastating than harvest failures effecting larger areas.\\n	England also lagged behind the Netherlands, but by 1650 their agricultural industry was commercialized on a wide scale. The last peace-time famine in England was in 1623-24.23 There were still periods of hunger, as in the Netherlands, but there were no more famines. Enclosure of common pasture for private use and the consolidation of farms are two of the commercial developments of the time that are credited with helping England commercialize its agriculture.24 There were other developments, as in the Netherlands, such as the draining of marshes, more efficient field use patterns, and the wider introduction of industrial crops. These agricultural developments led to wider prosperity in England and increasing urbanization. In both England and the Netherlands the populations stabilized at about the same time that agriculture had been widely commercialized and the countries had escaped from the cycle of famine. \\n	Ronald Seavoy believes that the stabilization of the population, evident in both countries represents the successful commercialization of the agricultural economy.25 The Dutch population stabilized between 1650 and 1750,26 and so did the English.27 Seavoy believes that this is a reflection of the decreased value of children in commercialized economy. For a wage labourer a child is less valuable in an economic sense than for a subsistence peasant. The child will be expensive for the wage labourer to raise, and the child will not contribute very much to the family for many years, whereas for a peasant, the more children there are, the more helpers there are for food production. As a result, the number of births declines in a commercialized economy. The birth rate rose again after 1750 because of increasing industrialization which represents a factor independent of the behaviour of rural workers.\\n	Often enough, famines in early modern Europe were either caused by or severely compounded by war. Wars were very disruptive to international trade, often interfering with the delivery of goods. If an area was directly affected by war, such as Germany during the Thirty Years’ War, the results could be extremely serious.28 Troops would plunder food and destroy agricultural infrastructure. War could also be very serious for areas not directly affected by the war, but which were required to supply food to the army, or whose trade routes were disrupted.29 France suffered from very poor weather in 1692 and, compounded with the ongoing wars of Louis XIV, there was a serious famine.30 To some degree, wars also hampered the efforts of local administrations to alleviate the effects of famine.\\n	Since famines were very destabilizing for any society, it was in the interests of the governing power to prevent them. During the seventeenth century this was usually handled at a local level, even in highly centralized states such as France.31 Government had a lot of power over the conduct of business during this period and they used it as best they could during periods of famine. Tactics used included the prohibition of the export of grain from famine stricken areas. Nothing incited riots more than the sight of food being taken out of the affected areas.32 The governments also regulated the price and quality of bread. They regulated who could buy bread and when, insuring that the poor got bread as well as the rich.33 The main tool at the disposal of a local government was buying grain from somewhere else and distributing it to the population. This was very expensive, but often the only way to stave off complete starvation. The governments also established more long term measures designed to expand agricultural output of areas under their control such as encouraging land owners to expand their fields.\\n	There were some national programmes as well, where large states did exist. In both England and France there were fairly elaborate poor laws that were centrally guided. Although in both countries the laws were administered at a local level, they existed nationally. In France the national poor laws compelled all vagrants to return to their own home parish during times of famine.34  Then the local authorities would be responsible for charity.\\n	Local governments were usually reasonably successful at relieving the worst effects of famine. Famines were certainly still devastating, but often enough a government could keep the population fed where otherwise they might well have perished. They were often able to protect the cities from the worst effects of harvest failures, and often the peasants who flocked there in times of need.35  Sometimes, however, there was little that could be done given the state of agriculture in the area.\\n	There were measures that people could take on their own, beyond the obvious moves to increase agricultural output, to alleviate the problems that famines presented. It is now well established that rural peasants took measures to control the growth of their populations during times of hardship.36 Marriages were postponed to avoid births during times of poor harvests. Some people may have foregone marriage altogether. Children were given up, and there was also a significant rate of infanticide during periods of hardship. Even after hard times were over, replacement rates were often quite slow. These decisions on the part of peasants about their reproductive rate may well have had a greater effect on population than actual mortality from starvation or malnutrition.\\n	Famines were a fact of life in the seventeenth century as they had been since the beginning of agricultural society. The severity and number of famines rose in Europe during the seventeenth century due to the general cooling trend that was taking place then. At the same time, some European societies were beginning to show the way that Europe could escape peace time famine entirely. First the Netherlands, and then England freed themselves from the famine cycle through their use of new agricultural techniques, and above all, the commercialization and specialization of their agriculture. However, famine would continue to mark many areas of Europe, even in peacetime, until the 20th century. When famine did occur it sparked a number of responses from the population. Governments tried as best they could to deal with the situation, and the population would deal with the pressures in the only ways they knew how. Famines often had profound demographic effects on European societies. The economic effects were also profound. Often enough, famines were themselves reflections of economic and structural weaknesses in a society, but the famine would generally compound those problems, leading to even greater difficulties for that society. The grave problems that famines presented to European society continued to elicit many profound responses, including some that would ultimately lead to the end of peace-time famine in Europe.
Most foxes live 2 to 3 years but can survive for up to 10 years, or even longer, in captivity. With most species roughly the size of a domestic cat, foxes are smaller than other members of the family candiae, such as wolves, jackals, and domestic dogs.			A fox den is that the dirt excavated from the hole will be kicked out backwards, without much regard to placement. While a fox digs dirt like a dog, a groundhog will pat it neatly into a mound. The red fox prefer diverse habitat consisting of cropland, rolling farmland, brush, pastures, mixed hardwoods, and edges of open areas that provide suitable hunting grounds. Chaparral, wooded areas and among boulders on the slopes of rocky ridges in canyons and open desert.								Red foxes live in forests or temperate biomes. Red fox are in nearly every county of New York State and in many of the open spaces and parks of our cities and suburbs. Though red foxes prefer the pastures and meadows of farming country, they also are found in woodlands. Indeed they seem to prefer dens in forests or woodlots over those in open country.							Red foxes are solitary hunters who feed on rodents, rabbits, birds, and other small game but their diet can be as flexible as their home habitat. Foxes will eat fruit and vegetables, fish, frogs, and even worms. If living among humans, foxes will opportunistically dine on garbage and pet food. They den in hollow logs, beneath boulders, in ground burrows, or in hillsides.
Hi -- Great information about the US, but I wish you would not perpetuate the use of the phrase "Continental United States” as a term defining the 48 contiguous states.  It was once an accurate term before 1959 and the advent of Alaska’s transition from territory to the 49th state.  Yes, the term is still used a great deal, but for those of us in Alaska it creates confusion and further feelings of being treated as stepchildren of the rest of the United States.  Alaska IS a part of the continent, and to refer only to the lower 48 as continental is not accurate.  Confusion occurs when companies offer shipping to the US or to the Continental US, but sometimes they mean 48 of the Continental US and sometimes they mean all 49 of the Continental United States.  When a person searches through a web site, tries to place an order and then finds out shipping is not available it is discouraging.  Elimination of the term continental US as meaning only 48 of the 49 continental states would clear up many problems.  Thank you for taking the time to read this and to at least reconsider your meaning of the phrase. Thanks from a life long Alaskan – both before and after statehood.
First and foremost, we must not subject ourselves to the corporate media monster to define and verify the existance of language. Thus, Google may not be used as a barometer of linguistics. Second, panic attacks, although catagorically similiar in causation (i.e. stress, anxiety, and claustrophobia) the panic leave is a separated and clearly distinguishible from panic attacks by its own subjugation of environmental factors. The combination of panic attacks and panic leaves is only a trivial matter since the mere occurance of both phenomena would be an improbability.  Lastly, Wikipedia must join hands with the international community to set itself above the constraints of our cyberspace network in order to insure and embrace the evolution of Language. \\nFrancis Macomber

'''CSSDP''' The [[Canadian Students for Sensible Drug Policy]] is a national, grassroots, youth and student network. We provide the necessary education and resources to empower chapters formed by youth and students to work on substance use issues facing their community. Chapters do everything from peer and public education, to drug policy reform and harm reduction projects. In all these areas we support an approach scientifically studied and proven to be effective in decreasing the negative impact of drugs and drug policies on individuals, families and communities. '''Harm Reduction Policies''' ''Drugs are a Health issue''. All policies and programs aimed at reducing the harms associated with drug use in society should address the issue as a public health concern, not as a criminal justice issue. This has been proven to be more effective by studies worldwide.  '''Education''' ''Accessibility'' The Centre for Excellence in Youth Engagement has found that drug education and prevention programs that meet young people where they are at, even if they are using drugs and [[alcohol]], are the most effective.Education programs like DARE, run by the Police, may be effective in reminding youth that drugs are illegal. However, they have been highly ineffective in seriously reaching young people about drugs in their personal lives. ''Honest, Open Dialogue'' Drug education is an empowerment. Young people should be provided with all the information available and encouraged to make their own decisions about their physical and mental health. All education should acknowledge and respect young people’s personal experience, a discussion that should be approached only in a space of compassion and non-judgment.
  l. Sending Zealots to DeathsDear Editor: The recent talk by the pope given in an academic setting has set the world on fire. Muslims have gone on a rampage, murdering priests and nuns and attacking churches. If this is done out of religious zeal, the perpetrators put their religion in a bad light. If it is condoned by the Muslim clergy, they do a disservice to all Muslims. Clergy, whether Christian or Muslim, are human. They are not immune to temptation or error. However, if they are acting contrary to the tenets of their religion, their superiors or colleagues should correct them. We know that the slaughter visited on Muslim civilians by fellow Muslims in Iraq is inconsistent with the teaching of the Koran. I have read and reread the Koran searching for anything that will justify the practice of teaching children that Allah will reward them if they strap explosives around their body, go into a market place, board a bus or enter a restaurant and blow themselves up, killing and maiming fellow Muslims. It appears that some Imams are involved in promoting this practice. If this is a worthy endeavor, when will we see an Imam become a martyr? It is time for Imams and Muslim leaders to denounce their brethren who perpetrate, or approve, these atrocities and purge their ranks of those who violate the commands of Allah and employ the tools of Satan in their nefarious work.If this is a legitimate tactic in a holy war, it is time for an Imam or two to come forward and blow themselves up for the cause. Why do they not join the young suicides in the sacrifice of their lives?\\n  \\n \\nFrancis J. Donovan

{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n\\nIn 2006 forty four of the largest U.S food industries spent about 2billion dollars on advertising, which mainly consisted of unhealthy, sugary and fatty foods. Such massive advertising has a detrimental effect on children and it heavily influences their diets. Extensive research proves that most of the food consumed between ages of 2-18 is low in nutrients. Facing a lot of pressure from health industries and laws, such as Children's Food and Beverage Advertising initiative, food marketers were forced to tweak and limit their advertising strategies. Despite regulations, a 2009 report shows that three quarters of all food advertising during children's television programs were outside of law's boundaries. Government attempts to put a heavy burden on food marketers in order to prevent the issue, but food marketers enjoy the benefits of the First Amendment which limits government's power to prevent advertising against children. Federal Trade Commission states that children between the ages of 2-11 on daily average see 15 food based commercials on television. Most of these commercial involve high sugar and high fat foods, which adds to the problem of childhood obesity.

This paragraph needs to be re-written before being included as it contains a significant misconception. The tank does not create a "zero gravity" environment and the bit about "where gravity is and in which direction" is poorly worded. It is, however, correct that the brain does use a high proportion of its energy to maintain muscle contractions for balance but this is done subconciously so there is no space to "free [the brain] to attend to other matters". I'm sure there are many potential benefits from relaxation such as this but it would be better to leave out the incorrect use of scientific concepts such as gravity in this case. \\n\\n== Gravity ==\\n\\nDue to the high salt levels in the water, the floatation tank creates a zero gravity environment. Zero gravity allows the user to relax every single muscle: neck, arms, back and even ears. The tank enables the user to find those areas which are being held tense so they can be relaxed. Finding where gravity is and in which direction, then computing how the body can move and not fall over, takes about 90% of the brain's activity on a daily basis. Dr. Lilly's theory explains that when a user gets into the floateria capsule, the brain and body are free from all the gravity computations and the physical world. This leaves the brain free to attend to other matters.
\\n       Agriculture in Manipur\\n\\n  Agriculture in Manipur is one of the principal sources of revenue in the state and plays a pioneering role in strengthening the state's fiscal backbone. Manipur, one of the elite members of the seven sisters whose agglomeration forms northeastern India, is striving to boost its economy. \\n\\nAlthough, the net cropped area accounts for about 9.41% of the state's total area, agriculture is the main mean of economic subsistence of over 76% of the workforce. It is interesting to note that 52% of the total agricultural area lies in the valley and is responsible for the livelihood of more than half the populace of Manipur valley. \\n\\nPaddy is the principal crop that is cultivated. The quintessential Manipuri Rice is famed all over the country for its sweet flavor and aromatic fragrance. This sweet rice can be consumed wholly on its own, without any additional gravy or curry. Apart from rice, wheat, maize and pulses, fruits and vegetables are also grown aplenty. \\n\\nPunghul and relocating and transplanting seeds are the primary modes of cultivation that are practiced in the state. Jhum and terrace cultivation is extensively practiced in the hilly areas. The land is usually cleared during the months of January and February and couple months later, during the summer months of April, May and June the seeds are planted. Finally harvesting commences in October and culminates in early December. The soil and climatic conditions are also conducive to the growth of all sorts of crops.
The Quest for Environmental Justice in the National Park System\\n\\n=== Introduction === \\nFrom its inception, the national park system had the dual goal of improving conservation of natural resources and creating places of enjoyment for the public and future generations. Currently, in 2012 there are over 10,000 protected areas around the world, with 365 national parks located in the United States alone (Tilden 1951:13). In light of the prevalence of protected environmental areas worldwide, it is important to assess the social as well as environmental impacts of the creation of national parks. Little attention has been placed on evaluating the extent to which environmental justice is achieved within the park system, which is of particular concern as bioprospecting efforts and forced relocations of indigenous populations increase. \\n\\n\\nEnvironmental justice within national parks primarily concerns locals’ access rights, which are dictated by the political and social institutions that govern protected areas. The EPA defines environmental justice as, “The fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies” (Miller et al. 2003:G5). Given the EPA’s definition, environmental justice necessitates the involvement by local populations in the national park system. Yet limited access rights and restricted management participation, in addition to ideological legacies of national parks that stem from Eurocentric views of the environment, have made it challenging to achieve environmental justice fully. To facilitate scholarly discussion about environmental justice within the national park system, the central issues that obstruct justice will be presented, followed by methods to overcome these obstacles to achieve the multifaceted goal of promoting conservation, sustainability, and recreation fairly for all populations. \\n\\n=== The Establishment of National Parks ===\\n \\n==== Motives ==== \\nThere is some debate about the true intentions behind creating national parks. While some historians assert that the national parks were developed with altruistic intentions of ecological preservation and wildlife protection (Kuo 2012:728), biodiversity protection and conservation (Cernea 2006:1809), and out of closeness with nature, the actual motives for creating land preservations may have been much darker. Other historians, ecologists, and anthropologists contend that the national park system arose because certain land was not profitable as a source of agricultural or timber production (Kuo 2012:728). \\n\\nWarwick Frost and Michael Hall claimed that the motivation for the creation of the national park varied between different countries to fit each country’s needs (Frost et al. 2009:357). While national parks were set up to promote outdoor recreation in countries like the United States and Canada, the underlying factor for creation of the parks however, is purely economic (Frost et al. 2009:357). The notion of the national park relied primarily on the perceptions of “worthless land (for large scale mining or agricultural production), tourism’s economic value on the land, and an acute demand for places for public enjoyment” (Frost et al. 2009:357). Robert Turner, in Market Failures and the Rationale for National Parks, asserts that national parks were established in order to create a sense of national identity, and to protect important historical and ecological resources (Turner 2002:350). Although he notes that national parks successfully preserve ecosystems, conserve biodiversity, protect wildlife, and safeguard native cultures, he ultimately argues that market failures (i.e. unprofitable land) are used as justification for national parks (Turner 2002:347-350).  \\n\\n==== Western Ideologies of the Environment ==== \\nDiffering views toward the environment and peoples’ role within it, dictates the way that land is utilized and managed. As Dahlberg, Rohde, and Sandell astutely observed, “Conservation of protected areas is primarily about how we perceive such landscapes, how we place differential values on different landscape components, and who gets to decide on these values” (Dahlberg et al. 2010:209). Thus, society’s perception of the environment, as well as the social and political institutions that decide which landscapes to protect, play significant roles in the determination of national park regions. \\nWestern ideologies regarding the environment typically neglected the interplay between man and forest, and portrayed nature as pristine and untouched by local populations. The areas that received attention as natural environments worthy of protection were those that were free of human activity, and there was general disregard for the significance of the relationship indigenous populations maintained with the land (Dahlberg et al. 2010:210).\\n\\n\\nThe Eurocentric view of pristine nature and wilderness dictated which lands were ultimately selected as national parks. The National Park Service sought to “Preserve, in a condition as unaltered as is humanly possible, the wilderness that greeted the eyes of the first white men who challenged and conquered it,” said Freeman Tilden (Tilden 1951:417). Tilden’s remarks accurately depict the white elitist views that shaped the park system. Tilden highlights the point that, according to traditional Western ideologies, nature is seen juxtaposed with mankind, and minority populations are considered to be submissive to whites. This tainted perception of the relationship between indigenous populations and the environment severely limited local access to the land, because white elitists looked down upon locals’ dependence on the environment and their use of natural resources (Frost et al. 2009:357). Since the institutions and sectors of society that possessed the most power were predominately white, Western ideologies formed the basis for the national park system and continue to impede environmental justice because the basic principles the park system was founded upon were unjust. \\n\\n=== Forced Displacement of Indigenous Populations ===\\nOne of the most difficult obstacles to environmental justice in the national park system lies in the fact that indigenous populations, who both lived on and shaped the land, are forced to relocate if their territory is selected for a national park citing. This unfair eradication of local communities results in local communities bearing a disproportionate cost of conservation (MacKenzie 2012:93).\\nDisplaced populations face a slew of economic, social, and political problems. Compulsory removal processes leave locals without their land, homes, and source of income. The lifestyles of local communities that revolved around hunting and gathering, for example, cannot be altered instantaneously. Compensation for displacement is rarely commensurate with the value of all that is lost during relocation, and this unfairly hurts the livelihoods of locals. \\n\\nForced displacements additionally strip locals of their connection with the land and along with it, their cultural identity. Displaced individuals face the risk of marginalization by society, especially when they relocate to regions with different cultural, social, and economic backgrounds (Cernea 2006:1829). In addition to these social ramifications, locals are further disempowered by the denial of both human rights and positions of authority as managers of national parks. Community members are endowed with the right to utilize and live on land that they inhabited for hundreds of years, and they have the right to be justly compensated should they decide to relocate for the creation of a national park. However, the social institutions that protect the rights of local communities are lacking and require improvement (Cernea 2006:1829). \\nAdditionally, forced displacement of indigenous populations negatively impact biodiversity. The livelihoods of local communities depends on natural resources found in the park, and there is a tendency for displaced individuals to return to national parks to continue to hunt and gather food, even though it is now illegal for them to do so. Also, evicted persons contribute to unsustainable resource use outside of national parks by putting stress on the environment and ecological resources in already overpopulated regions (Cernea 2006:1828). Given the risks to biodiversity posed by forced relocations, it seems only logical to protect both the human rights of communities and the environment, by halting coerced displacements. As Cernea advocated, the forced relocations, “that destroy people’s livelihood and trample on their human rights should not be done” (Cernea 2006: 1829).\\n\\n=== Environmental Racism === \\nEnvironmental racism occurs when minority populations are unfairly exposed to contamination, pollution, and degraded environments due to their race and inferior political and economic status. In light of current opinions which claim national park land was selected based on the economic uselessness of land and originated from a white elitist perception of nature, it comes as no surprise that environmental racism plays a role in the obstruction of justice in the park system. \\n\\nThe Eurocentric ideologies that shaped the formation of protected areas do not promote local engagement or increase community benefits. Cernea makes this point eloquently; “Science and nationalism have been employed by powerful elites to justify exclusion and control of national parks” (Cernea 2006: 1808). Land belonging to poor and marginalized communities was targeted for situating national parks by elites who disregarded rights of locals, and locals were further disempowered by displacement from their homeland (Cernea 2006:1827). Moreover, while whites benefited from the creation of national parks, other minorities bore disproportionate costs of conservation. “For the white elite, national parks and other protected areas became popular for recreational purposes and access opportunities increased; The management structures of national parks worked to alienate black people from land and landscapes that had previously been part of their identity and knowledge base” (Ramutsindela 2004:1). \\nWhile some nations including the United States, sought to develop a sense national identity through the development of national parks, minority communities were stripped of identities that they developed over centuries of inhabiting the land. \\n\\nLocals who are displaced by national parks do not enjoy the same economic and political status, or overall wellbeing as other parts of society. Resettlers face increased morbidity and mortality from exposure to more different diseases, compounded by the fact that they are less able to pay for expensive medical care (Cernea 2006:1826). For example, in the Botwa population in Africa, the child mortality rate was a staggering 47.7% in 2004; triple that of Uganda’s national average of 14.1% (Cernea 2006:1826). \\n\\n=== Poverty === \\n\\nForced resettlements of local populations upon park establishment inflicted poverty and caused negative ramifications for locals, compromising the quest for conservation and biodiversity. Displacement of local populations expels individuals from their source of income and diminishes their standards of living. Studies conducted by Michael Cernea found that the majority of displaced people went on to find marginalized jobs that did not pay well and were further impoverished by lack of compensation by the park system (Cernea 2006:1820-1824). Moreover, research conducted in Africa found that more than 80% of the displaced Batwa population remained uncompensated for their loss of land and did not have homes after six years of displacement (Cernea 2006:1828).\\n\\nCernea criticizes the national park system for its lack of regard for the economic and social costs from the creation of preservation areas, and he promotes the concept of double sustainability which entails a dual pursuit of people’s livelihoods and biodiversity (Cernea 2006: 1808-1830). One flaw in the national park system is that it tends to pay attention only to the environment, while it disregards the role indigenous populations maintain with nature and the social and economic effects of park development. \\n\\n=== Ecotourism === \\nEcotourism is touted as a green industry and has its roots embedded in the formation of the national park system (Frost et al. 2009:729). This form of tourism focuses on nature and aims to improve conservation and sustainability while fostering an appreciation for cultural heritage. Despite the potential monetary and environmental benefits of ecotourism, there are also negative impacts that accompany this market practice. \\nEcotourism’s altruistic goals are often compromised by “demand for access, construction of tourism facilities, and the wide spread ill-behavior of visitors” (Frost et al. 2009:729). The increasing development of land that was set aside for the sake of preservation, defeats the purpose of creating the national park in the first place. Moreover, increasing populations and stresses on natural resources prohibit national parks from fully achieving conservation. This calls into question the “applicability of the national park concept,” because if the system does not adequately further conservation and an appreciation for nature, then the system could be deemed a failure (Frost et al. 2009:729). Despite Burnett and Bulters’ positive views on the national park system regarding conservation, these authors affirmed the inherent problem in using the national park as a development (tourism) tool for its preservation objectives (Burnett et al. 1987:41). Too often, economic incentives overtake ecological goals of conservation thereby defeating the purpose of the park system. \\n\\nCernea similarly voices concern over ecotourism. Despite ecotourism’s reputation as something that promotes biodiversity and conservation efforts, it rarely generates benefits that outweigh the costs of increased tourism. “The most recent GEF study recognized about such assumed ecotourism benefits that ‘it is highly unlikely that revenue from wildlife and tourism will ever constitute a particular large source of income for all members of a community’” (Cernea 2006:1827). Furthermore, the stark disregard for indigenous people’s role in the environment and their lack of political influence in developing and managing parks, leave local communities disempowered.  \\n\\n=== Bioprospecting === \\nBioprospecting is the commercial use of biological resources and traditional knowledge in the development of new products (Hayden 2003:359). Bioprospecting has become more prevalent worldwide as scientists and pharmaceutical companies endeavor to uncover biological resources and develop new ways to utilize fauna and flora. However, there is often failure by commercial companies and scientists to properly compensate or recognize the contributions from locals’ knowledge. Today, more and more large companies and research groups view national parks as potential bioprospecting sources, which calls into question the role national parks should play in supplying commercially exploitable resources to these entities.\\n\\nProponents of bioprospecting in national parks view the parks as a library of environmental knowledge and resources (Jansen et al. 1998:39). The knowledge and information that could be obtained within national parks might, according to bioprospecting supporters, greatly benefit society. Furthermore, in order to properly preserve the geologic features within the parks, it is necessary to have an in depth understanding of its resources and this necessitates scientific research. \\n\\nIn addition to the appeal of scientific information that could provide useful products and tools for society, economic incentives also entice the Park Service to encourage bioprospecting efforts. Poor funding and commercial pressures from companies and research facilities make it increasingly difficult for the Park Service to deny bioprospecting companies’ access to the parks’ biological resources (Jansen et al. 1998:44). These unexpected monetary gains from national parks’ resources appear to be an additional benefit, but in reality, income from bioprospecting is usually small, and by engaging in bioprospecting, national parks fail to uphold their duties as places of conservation and public enjoyment. \\n\\n==== The Case of Bioprospecting in Yellowstone ==== \\nControversy surrounding bioprospecting in national parks is especially evident in the case of Yellowstone National Park. As the first national park in the world, Yellowstone is expected to provide an example of the qualities a national park should possess. Notably, the goals of the national park system are to preserve scenery, natural resources, and aid conservation in a “natural and unimpaired state for the benefit and inspiration of all people” (Jansen et al. 1998:45). Bioprospecting in Yellowstone however, compromised the aforementioned goals. \\nIn 1997 Yellowstone National Park signed an agreement with the biotechnical company, Diversa, to allow Diversa to collect organisms from thermal pools in search of commercially exploitable products (Doremus 1991:407-409). In exchange for access to Yellowstone’s resources, Diversa would pay Yellowstone $20,000 per year plus royalties from revenues generated by the bioprospecting products (Doremus 1991:409). However, the financial costs were twice as much as the cash return to Yellowstone, and in 1998 plaintiffs from the Edmonds Institute sued the Park Service for not preparing an Environmental Impact Statement before allowing Diversa to carry out bioprospecting in Yellowstone (Doremus 1991:411). This private expropriation of public resources was considered inappropriate (Jansen et al. 1998:45), and opponents viewed it as, “the kind of science the Park Service should not permit” (Doremus 191: 477).  \\n\\nFinancial incentives from bioprospecting dilute the goals of the national park system. While the argument that bioprospecting encourages conservation and a better understanding of the natural resources in national parks sounds appealing, no economic inducement should be necessary to protect national parks (Doremus 1999:401). National parks were originally created in order to promote conservation and foster a meaningful relationship between man and the environment – not for exploitation of natural resources. The paradigm shift from regarding parks as a place of conservation, to a place of economic gain, defeats the innate purpose of setting aside land as a protected area. Furthermore, it could create a slippery slope where the Park Service has no choice but to sell the parks’ biological resources in order to generate enough revenue to keep the parks up and running. Therefore, bioprospecting should be prohibited in national parks so that they may fulfill their original intentions of preserving the environment and wildlife for generations to come.  \\n\\n=== Local Access Rights ===\\nLocal indigenous populations too often lose their access to and ability to utilize land after it has been designed as a national park. Stemming back to the Eurocentric view of the environment as something pristine and untainted by mankind, the institutions that established protected areas sought to curtail locals’ utilization of the land. Unfortunately, this negatively impacted indigenous livelihoods because of the locals’ reliance on natural resources including forests, fish, and other game. “Local communities can perceive the loss of access to these [national parks] lands as limiting their ability to survive and building economies based on natural resource extraction from, or agricultural development, of these protected areas” (MacKenzie 2012:93). While individuals who are forced to relocate obviously have restricted access to cultivatable lands, they can also be prohibited in using the land and its resources in their traditional way. Restricted access, Cernea argues, is another form of forced displacement and severely hurts locals’ livelihoods (Cernea 2006:1809).  \\n\\n=== Room for Improvement === \\nDespite the aforementioned issues that make it difficult to achieve environmental justice for local populations, there are many ways the National Park Service can improve local’s access to the environment, decrease forced relocations, improve benefit sharing, limit impoverishment of displaced locals, halt bioprospecting, while concomitantly preserving the environment and fostering an appreciation of nature for the general public. These solutions require increased local involvement in the decision-making processes regarding national parks, and a restructuring of the political and social institutions that govern the parks. Environmental justice will only be achieved once a paradigm shift occurs that transitions away from the Eurocentric ideology of pristine nature, toward another that recognizes the interplay between the environment and indigenous populations. The following measures will help achieve these goals: \\n\\n	\\n* Reform the ideological contexts that dictated the way conservation efforts evolved. Recognize the different ways people view the environment and acknowledge the historical and cultural values of local populations.   \\n* 	Safeguard indigenous livelihoods by avoiding involuntary displacement operations that impoverish locals (Cernea 2006:1808).  \\n* 	Increase revenue sharing to benefit local communities while improving conservation efforts (MacKenzie 2012:93-97).   \\n* 	Provide more benefits to the locals who lost more due to the development of the park, instead of distributing compensation homogenously (MacKenzie 2012:93).  \\n* 	Halt bioprospecting in national parks in order to safeguard natural resources and local knowledge, without compromising the National Park System’s original goals to further conservation.   \\n* 	Include local communities in the process of establishing, planning, and developing national parks to provide them with the same political and human rights as other sectors of society.   \\n* 	Conservation agencies should be denied funds so long as they do not enact social safeguards to protect local communities from forced displacements from parks. These safeguards include policies consistent with those developed by the World Bank (Cernea 2006:1830).  \\n* 	Pursue double sustainability that protects both people’s livelihoods and natural resources, instead of focusing solely on the biological side (Cernea 2006:1830).  \\n\\n\\n\\nBurnett, G Wesley, and Lisa Mathis Butler\\n    1987 National Parks in the Third World and Associated National Characteristics.    \\n    Leisure Sciences, 9(1): 41.\\n\\nCernea, Michael M, and Kai Schmidt-Soltau. \\n     2006 Poverty Risks and National Parks: Policy Issues in Conservation and  \\n    Resettlement.

Antartica is a quite "primitive" country. It is uncivilized (to some extent) however, there are a select few who still inhabit this age-old "block of ice". As of 5:46 P.M. central time, April 21st, 2007, the country was conquered and is now under the sole responsibility of Richard Smith, a native to the United States. He is currently requesting any help that anyone will gladly offer; fundage is a most significant point of focus. If you have any talent(s) whatsoever, such as repairing lawn mowers, making cheese sandwiches, eating peanut butter, etc., you can help him in his attempt to develop a more advanced civilization. You will be gladly granted citizenship in your effort towards making Antarctica a better place to live. Polar bear wranglers are another necessity we ask for. Much of the past civilization (1 out of 3 people) have been eaten by polar bears. It was only one bear that has been a pain in the ass, but still, come on, we can't have that. More information coming soon...

Thanks to the technology we have today it is much more difficult to limit the flow of information. Resources such as wikipedia and google give us the ability to have a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips. Unlike books, there is no single author who can change facts to suit his own ideas. Millions of easily accessible sources eliminate the monopoly of information that was once held by the rich, and allows anyone to post their opinion, making biases much more easily detectable. How does this system compare to what was available to Liesel?\\n<br />\\nIn fact that’s a question that is quite easy to answer. The MMC library offers a large number of books that relate to the holocaust. I ''strongly'' recommend that you check out “The war against the Jews” by Lucy S. Dawidowicz.
Poverty is a state that some people in the world are in which includes them, having little or no money, little support, and having poor conditions. In my opinion, too many people in the world are in poverty, especially in other countries. People, especially in different countries, should have the privilege to obtain good health, money, and a fair amount of support. My prediction is that the United States doesn’t have a big percent of population in poverty. Also, I think that some countries in South America and certain places in Europe don’t have as high as percentage of people in poverty as other places. On the other hand, Countries and cities in Africa, Asia, and Mexico might have a higher percentage of the population in poverty. Poverty cannot be classified in counties, because one part of the country might be rich and one part might be poor. It is easier and more accurate to classify percentages of poverty by towns, and city, because for the most part the whole city or town is either in poverty or it isn’t.
Oliver, British Columbia, is a small town located in the South Okanagan. Billing itself as the "Wine Capital of Canada," Oliver is renowned for its high quality wine. The climate and topography offer the optimum conditions necessary to grow the preferred Vinifera wine grapes and the town has the largest concentration of both vineyards and commercial wineries in British Columbia. Approximately 30 wineries are located within 15 minutes of Oliver. Many of these are located along what is known as the Golden Mile of Highway 97, just south of Oliver. The rolling terraces, exceptionally mild climate with lots of sun, gravelly soil and availability of irrigation produce the right elements for growing high-quality grapes, as well as cherries, peaches and other soft fruits.
Mental/Squad Telepathy\\n          Mental telepathy has also been   referred to as "Squad Telepathy." \\nThe first origins were from Ancient Rome, when philosophers such as Aristotle\\n and Copernicus observed such patterns. They noticed that they had many of\\n the same ideas as the other philosophers that they associated with. Not much\\n was said or documented about these claims, as it was waved off as a coincidence.\\n Later, in the Renaissance, more philosophers noticed evidence of mental telepathy,\\nalso known as squad telepathy. It was documented for the first time during the\\n Renaissance by Galileo, when he conducted experiments with local peasants,\\n Knights, and even royalty. What he found was shocking. Some people are said\\n to have a certain gift of squad telepathy. These select few tend to have a few\\n common qualities. They have a strong connection with themselves, their associates,\\n the world around them, and a great sense of humor. Approximately ninety percent \\nof these subjects were also in excellent physical condition.\\n          Many modern studies have been conducted at the University of Miami and the\\n College of Notre Dame, where squad telepathy is very prevalent. The most recent case\\n was in a Notre Dame student in 1997. No since cases have been documented, but going\\n along with mental telepathy trends, a new "mind reader" is born approximately every\\n twenty years.
\\nKuru\\n\\n\\nKuru is a disease of the nervous system.\\n\\nCauses, incidence, and risk factors\\n\\nKuru is a very rare disease. It is caused by an infectious protein (prion) found in contaminated human brain tissue.\\n\\nKuru is found among people from New Guinea who practiced a form of cannibalism in which they ate the brains of dead people as part of a funeral ritual. This practice stopped in 1960, but cases of kuru were reported for many years afterward because the disease has a long incubation period.\\n\\nKuru causes brain and nervous system changes similar to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Similar diseases appear in cows as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also called mad cow disease.\\n\\nThe main risk factor for kuru is eating human brain tissue, which can contain the infectious particles.
== Introduction ==\\nWith snow avalanches, there is little that it will not take with it. Rocks, soil, trees, ice and the debris of anything that gets in its way. Avalanches interrupt transportation, destroy buildings, pylons and transmission towers and can ruin the reputation and economy of otherwise desirable settlements. The economic cost of prevention and reaction to all these impacts is considerable, but more importantly the human cost is often high and many people are injured or killed in avalanche related accidents every year.\\n\\nOne of the largest avalanche disasters in recent history occurred in February 1999 when a single avalanche in [[Galtur_Avalanche | Galtür]] cost thirty-eight people their lives (Thompson 1999). The heavily populated mountain ranges of Europe are often where the effects of avalanches are most serious. In the Alps approximately 120 people are killed every year. In some years the death toll is even higher. For example, in 1951, 98 people were killed in Switzerland and, in 1954, 143 people were killed in Austria alone (McClung and Schaerer 1993). Little was known about the physics of avalanches or how to predict them back then in the fifties so these disasters were very difficult to forecast. Fifty million people now go skiing every year (Holdsworth 1998) so it is clear that we need to know when avalanches are going to occur so we can act proactively and save lives and money rather than waiting for the avalanches to happen and then act. \\n\\nTo know when an avalanche may happen we need to know under what conditions they are likely to occur and which of these conditions are most important. Once these conditions are known, processes can be set up to judge whether or not an avalanche is likely. This is the science of avalanche forecasting, a science in which there are no second chances. An unforeseen avalanche could result in loss of life, disruption and high clean up and repair costs; whereas almost as seriously, a false alarm may result in unnecessary panic and evacuation. The net result of both these occurrences being loss of faith in the forecaster and in the science as a whole. If people do not trust the warnings or assurances of an avalanche forecaster they become ineffective no matter how accurate they are next time. Williams (1980) states that to be effective, an Avalanche warning program must inspire public confidence. It is therefore in everyone’s interest for the processes involved in avalanche forecasting to be a fool–proof and trustworthy as possible.\\n\\nAccording to LaChapelle (1977), avalanche forecasting has been done ever since human beings first began to live on mountains, even by resorting to witchcraft, he suggests. Since the 1950s methods of avalanche forecasting have become more scientific, although depending on empirical experience and intuition. Recent work has concentrated on the use of computers and models with some exceptions, notably Professor Dent of Montana State University who places an observation hut in the path of an artificially induced avalanche. From there he can make close observations of the way the snow travels and the velocities, densities and pressures thus involved; in the hope of learning more about how an avalanche is initiated. He hopes to develop new models and tools to remove the educated guesswork, replacing it with ‘hard science’ (Dent in Holdsworth 1998). The Swiss Snow and Avalanche Institute has recently initiated similar research led by Dr. Issler. Some of their findings were critical in solving the mystery of the catastrophic and unexpected Galtür avalanche in February 1999. Before these scientists braved real avalanches, studies relied upon the simulation of avalanches using powdered glass in water tanks (Thompson 1999, Hopfinger et al 1977).\\n\\n== Field Methods ==\\n\\n== Computer Models ==\\n\\n== References ==\\nArmstrong, R.L. 1977. ‘Continuos Monitoring of Metamorphic Changes of Internal Snow Structure as a Tool in Avalanche Studies.’ Journal of Glaciology, 19, pp 325 – 334.\\nBolognesi, R., Buser, O and Good, W. 1994. ‘Local Avalanche Forecasting in Swizerland: Strategy and Tools.

Bank robbery is the crime of stealing from a bank. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, robbery is, "the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear."[1] By contrast, burglary is defined as, "unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft."[2] Definitions vary in other countries, however. In the United Kingdom, robbery is the removal or taking away of property from a place in which you are entitled to be (without any requirement for force or violence to be threatened or used)[dubious – discuss], whilst burglary is largely in line with the US version, entering property unlawfully. In layman's terms, therefore, bank robbery is entering a bank when it is open and either by using force or the threat of force or otherwise obtaining valuables, usually money. Entering a bank when it is closed is burglary.\\n\\nBank robbery is a predominantly urban crime, taking place most frequently in cities and large towns. The share of bank robberies in small towns increased from about 20% in 1996 to about one third in 2002[citation needed], but the majority of bank robberies are concentrated in urban areas. This concentration is often attributed to there being more branches in urban areas, but the number of bank robberies is disproportionately higher than the number of branches. In Canada, for example, seven cities have 30 percent of all bank branches but 66 percent of all bank robberies; in the United Kingdom, London has 10 percent of the nation's branches but 39 percent of its bank robberies.\\n\\nThis has advantages both for bank robbers and for the law enforcement community. Being in urban areas the transportation infrastructure is more highly developed, especially where banks tend to cluster near to retail shopping areas and commercial districts. Such banks are highly profitable targets for bank robbers who are then afforded a number of potential escape routes. The law enforcement community benefit by being able to respond more quickly and the likelihood of catching a bank robber on or near the scene is higher than for other types of crime. This is because most bank robberies are reported very quickly, frequently while the crime is in progress, most bank robberies occur during daylight hours, have multiple witnesses and with modern technology often produce photographic images that can be distributed and used immediately to canvass the local area. Consequently, many robbers are caught the same day. In fact, the clearance rate for bank robbery is among the highest of all crimes, almost 60 percent.\\n\\nThe urban location of the crime also contributes to its repeat victimization profile, a measure of how quickly a crime victim will suffer a repeat of the original crime. One study carried out by the Home Office found that in England, one third of banks at which a robbery has occurred will be robbed again within three months, while the same study found that in Tallahassee, Florida, one quarter of robbed banks will suffer repeat robbery within a week, and over half of robbed banks will be robbed again within a month. [3]\\n\\nThe Australian Institute of Criminology analyzed trends in bank robbery over a four year period. Of the 808 bank robbery incidents between January 1998 and May 2002 in which the number of offenders involved in the hold-up was recorded, more than half (55 percent) were committed by lone offenders, about 25 percent by pairs, and around 20 percent by three or more robbers. Unarmed lone offenders accounted for the majority of all robberies (28 percent of all robberies), caused the least number of injuries to victims (one percent of all victims' injuries), were the type of robber who most often used a note to threaten bank staff (46 percent of all their robberies), and failed most often in their robbery attempts (33 percent of their robberies). Unarmed gangs inflicted the most injuries to victims (51 percent of all victim injuries) and failed the least in their robbery attempts (six percent of their robberies). Armed robbers used a disguise more often compared to unarmed robbers, with armed pairs employing disguises most often (59 percent of their robberies).[4]\\n\\nA 2005 study by Pastore and Maguire found that injuries occur in about two percent of bank robberies in the US, and about six percent of robberies in Australia, and that a death occurs in approximately one third of all bank robberies.[5]\\n\\nViolent takeover type bank robberies do occur, but are very rare. The majority of bank robberies taking place today are so called "note jobs." These are usually accomplished by simply passing a written note to the teller demanding money. The idea is to attract as little attention as possible. In most cases, other customers present in the bank during such a robbery are completely unaware of what is occurring. Standard bank policy is to avoid violence as much as possible, so they will normally hand over the money and try to adhere to the robber's demands. The robber usually makes away with cash, but typically in relatively small amounts.\\nContents\\n[hide]\\n\\n    * 1 History\\n          o 1.1 Historical Bank Robbers\\n    * 2 Prevention\\n    * 3 See also\\n    * 4 References\\n    * 5 External links\\n\\n[edit] History\\nBurglars Tools Found in the Bank, printed in 1875 in the Canadian Illustrated News\\n\\nAccording to the Independence Hall Association in Philadelphia, the first bank robbery in America happened during the night of August 31 or the early morning of September 1, 1798 at the Bank of Pennsylvania at Carpenters' Hall. The vaults were apparently robbed of $162,821, or approximately $1.8 million in 2006 dollars. Because no forced entry evidence existed, authorities assumed it was an "inside" job. Several suspects were immediately imprisoned and prosecuted, but the culprits eventually charged were a man, Isaac Davis, and a partner. Within days of the heist, Davis' partner fell victim to a plague of yellow fever that ravaged Philadelphia that summer.\\n\\nDuring the American Civil War, raiders from both Union and Confederate armies robbed banks in enemy-controlled towns. These robberies were at the time regarded as legitimate acts of war, but many of the raiders carried on robbing banks in the post-war era, giving rise to the famous robber gangs of the late 19th century.\\n\\n[edit] Historical Bank Robbers\\n\\nIn the early twentieth century Willie Sutton was asked why he robbed banks and he was famously reported as answering "Because that's where the money is." This is, in fact, a quote invented by the interviewer to make the story more interesting.[6] Another famous bank robber was John Dillinger, who committed bank robbery crimes in mid-western America. Some considered him a dangerous criminal, while others idolized him as a supposed present-day Robin Hood. He gained this latter reputation (and the nickname "Jackrabbit") for his graceful movements during bank heists, such as leaping over the counter (a movement he supposedly copied from the movies) and many narrow getaways from police. On July 22, 1934 in Chicago, Illinois, Dillinger was cornered by FBI agents in an alley outside of a movie theater, drew a pistol against them, and died at that location of gunshot wounds.\\n\\n[edit] Prevention\\n\\nBanks have implemented modern security measures, like motion-sensing and high resolution color security cameras, time-locked heavy vault doors, silent alarms, exploding dye packs, bait money and locator devices. Some banks supplement this protection with armed or unarmed security guards. [7]\\n\\nGone are the days when expert safe crackers could crack the code to a vault or safe. Today's biometric technology makes non-violent methods of gaining access nearly impossible. Modern vaults and safes are also reinforced to the point that the amount of explosives needed to blow them open would likely create unwanted attention and possible even cause the building to collapse. Even the most impregnable vault or safe needs to be able to be opened by someone. To circumvent vault and safe security features, robbers often kidnap the bank manager, but that is not always a successful workaround as banks have often removed the manager's ability to open the vault. Kidnapping also enables the police to lay more charges and thus more jail time for the robbers should they get caught.\\n\\nThe police have new measures at their disposal to catch robbers, such as well-armed SWAT teams, and pursuit cars (often a high-powered vehicle) driven by a trained driver that is capable of keeping pace with getaway cars. Forensic identification techniques have also improved greatly; should a bank robber fire a gun, the police can trace the bullet to the exact firearm using ballistic fingerprinting. Martin Kemp, in a BBC documentary, once inquired on the effectiveness of an Uzi in a bank robbery, to which the firearms training instructor joked "that would be thirty pieces of evidence to convict you." The sawed-off shotgun, a common robbery weapon in United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand where handguns are difficult to obtain, are easily concealable but not particularly effective.\\n\\nWhile it is likely but not certain that the first time someone robs a bank they will not be caught, it is highly likely that if they continue they will be caught. Few criminals are able to make a successful living out of bank robbery over the long run, since each attempt increases the probability that they will be identified and caught. Bank robberies are still fairly common and are indeed successful, although eventually many bank robbers are found and arrested. A report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation[8] states that, among Category I serious crimes, the arrest rate for bank robbery in 2001 was second only to that of murder. Today most organized crime groups tend to make their money by other means, such as drug trafficking, gambling, loan sharking, identity theft, or online scamming and phishing.\\n\\nA further factor making bank robbery unattractive for criminals in the United States is the severity with which it is prosecuted. Accounts at all US banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a corporation of the federal government, bringing bank robbery under federal jurisdiction and involving the FBI. United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines for bank robbery mandate long prison terms, which are usually further enhanced by the use or carrying of loaded firearms, prior criminal convictions, and the absence of parole from the federal prison system. As with any type of robbery, the fact that bank robbery is also inherently a violent crime typically causes corrections administrators to place imprisoned bank robbers in harsher high-security institutions.\\n\\n[edit] See also\\n\\n    * List of famous bank robbers and robberies\\n    * Convenience store crime\\n\\n[edit] References\\n\\n   1. ^ FBI definition of Bank Robbery\\n   2. ^ FBI definition of Burglary\\n   3. ^ Home Office study\\n   4. ^ Australian Institute of Criminology\\n   5. ^ Pastore and Maguire\\n   6. ^ Willie Sutton\\n   7. ^ Design of a GPS/GSM currency tracker device\\n   8. ^ Bank Robbery in the United States\\n\\n[edit] External links\\n\\n    * Armed Robbery Training Manuals and Training for sale\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2003\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2004\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2005\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2006\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2007 Q1\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2007 Q2\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2007 Q3\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2007 Q4\\n\\nRetrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_robbery"\\nCategories: Bank robberies | Bank robbers\\nHidden categories: Cleanup from July 2007 | All pages needing cleanup | Articles with limited geographic scope | Articles with disputed statements from June 2009 | All articles with unsourced statements | Articles with unsourced statements from April 2009\\nViews\\n\\n    * Article\\n    * Discussion\\n    * Edit this page\\n    * History\\n    * Watch\\n\\nPersonal tools\\n\\n    * Try Beta\\n    * VERY2PACKING00\\n    * My talk\\n    * My preferences\\n    * My watchlist\\n    * My contributions\\n    * Log out\\n\\nNavigation\\n\\n    * Main page\\n    * Contents\\n    * Featured content\\n    * Current events\\n    * Random article\\n\\nSearch\\n \\nInteraction\\n\\n    * About Wikipedia\\n    * Community portal\\n    * Recent changes\\n    * Contact Wikipedia\\n    * Donate to Wikipedia\\n    * Help\\n\\nToolbox\\n\\n    * What links here\\n    * Related changes\\n    * Upload file\\n    * Special pages\\n    * Printable version\\n    * Permanent link\\n    * Cite this page\\n    * PDF version\\n\\nCreate a book\\n\\n    * Add page to book\\n    * Books help\\n\\nLanguages\\n\\n    * Cymraeg\\n    * Deutsch\\n    * Español\\n    * Nederlands\\n    * 日本語\\n    * Svenska\\n    * ไทย\\n\\nPowered by MediaWiki\\nWikimedia Foundation\\n\\n    * This page was last modified on 12 August 2009 at 05:54.\\n    * Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License; additional terms may apply.

'''The Environmental impact of Uranium mining in Namibia'''\\n\\n[[Rossing Uranium Mine]] is owned by [[Rio Tinto Group]], the world’s largest mining group, which has annual Profits of over $1.4 billion.  It supplies enriched yellow cake uranium to power stations in France, UK, USA and Japan. The open-cast mine opened in 1976 and it has now been decided that the mine will close with the next few years. The company had an option of spending $100 million and expanding the mine, or closing down all operations by the year 2007; it close the latter. The mine also provides employment for 800 local people. In a country like [[Namibia]] which suffers from a severe lack of water, and has an annual rainfall of less than 30mm, that is a real probe Although mining causes environmental damage, these problems do not necessarily disappear with the closure of the mine. There are many dangerous waste products which would need to be disposed of and many methods that have been used at other mines in the past have been in effectual. Namibia is one of the African countries with a good environment compared to other countries.\\n\\nEvery prospecting and mining operation needs to comply with an environmental management plan (EMP), which is an outgrowth of the assessment of its environmental impacts (EIA). An EIA is mandatory before a prospecting or mining license is granted, and the EMP defines the activities that the operation must undertake to minimize environmental damage. The environmental impact of uranium mining in Namibia has also change the environment as Uranium mining is polluting the environment.  The uranium mining activities are done in the [[Namib-Naukluft National Park]], and this has even worried the Topnaar communities and has expressed their concern over the ongoing prospecting and mining of uranium in all areas that are protected because of their unique flora and fauna.  Mining in protected area is a threat to conservation of the desert and its living organisms.  The government should not give out too many prospecting licences, the Topnaar chief cautioned (New Era Oct. 13, 2008) mining uranium does not only possess health hazards but also environmental concerns such as water contamination, one of the serious issues that have not been addressed properly ( New Era April 21, 2005).\\n\\nAll the Namib uranium mines will bring ore to the surface, crush it, extract the valuable uranium and return the waste to the ground as rock piles or tailings dams or in-filled pits. A common denominator in all these operations is dust. Tons and tons of it – liberated at the surface and exposed to the desert winds. We all know that strong Namib winds pickup and carry dust over hundreds of kilometers, and some of this will blow over towns such as [[Swakopmund]], [[Arandis]] and [[Walvis Bay]]. How significant is this problem? It is difficult to tell, as the uranium mineral car notate can be found naturally on the surface of the gravel plains at Trek kopje, so we should not be surprised to find some of that material in the air.  \\n\\nThe activities that are being done at park is experiencing environmental effects from uranium prospecting and possibly in the future mining and what will happen to the tourism industry in the Namib when mining activities takes place ? Tourists will not want to visit the areas that are near mines or prospecting because of the visual scars on the landscape, noise and dust pollution.  Sensitive desert plants are being destroyed.  The levels of dust, itself being a problem, as well as the radioactive particles that it might carry, will be elevated by all this mining activity. Groundwater contamination Rössing is proud to proclaim that it has adequate measures in place to detect and prevent any spillage or leakage.\\n\\n'''Minimizing the risks'''\\n\\nThese five aspects reflect the biggest changes that could be inflicted upon us. Irrespective of how much you may want to keep Swakopmund or the Namib ‘as you knew it before’, it is going to be changed by uranium mining, so we should get used to the idea and make a positive contribution to the changes. One way could be to motivate for, and get involved in, a strategic planning exercise which spells out the various scenarios and provides options for how to guide or plan those scenarios better. For example, we might consider a zoning exercise in which certain high-value areas (for biodiversity, tourism or wilderness) would be forbidden for mining, as has been done in the Sperrgebiet. Certain areas and routes, already heavily disturbed, could be ear marked as the future desalination foci and the corridors for pipelines power lines that would serve the region at large. Social growth scenarios could be planned, including the growing need for domestic water, waste management and health services. Environmental monitoring stations could be set up to record possible pollutants and health statistics for the region as a whole could provide indicators of the effectiveness of radiation safety precautions.\\n \\n[[Uranium mining]] can be an economically and environmental accepted method for extracting uranium. Environmental impact in uranium mining has also advantages of such as lower capital and operating costs which required much smaller workforce, and the limited environmental impact as no waste lock, no tailing, and lower consumption of water.  One’s long-held impression of mines may be that they profess to bring great economic benefit to a country, yet deep down they are unconcerned with the environmental damage they inflict. Early indications, from the thoroughness of their EIAs, are that they operate on principles of transparency and responsibility to our natural and social environment. The proof of their commitment to make a net positive impact to this country will be seen in how effectively they prevent environmental damage arising from their cumulative activities. \\n\\nUser: Shikomba 21037319 | Shikomba 21037319 ([[User talk: Shikomba #top|talk]] ) 13:25, 16 May 2012 (UTC)\\n\\n== References ==\\n* Environmental Evaluation Associates of Namibia by: John Pallet\\n* Barnard Phoebe (ed) 1998 Biological Diversity of Namibia\\n* Uranium mining in Namibia” The mystery behind low level radiation by: H Shindondola-Mote\\n* Guidebook on Environmental impact Assessment for in Situ leach mining project (IAEA-TECDOC- 1428)\\n* Namibian Newspaper: uranium mining versus tourism, biodervisty by: Ndeshi Shiviya and Michelle Fourier (19 March 2012)\\n\\n\\n[[Wikipedia:School and university projects/Polytechnic of Namibia]]\\n\\n~~Liina K.

\\n\\nUnique characteristics of Rational Behavior Therapy as a psychotherapy in general, and as a cognitive-behavioral therapy in particular:\\n\\n* Based on the [[neurophysiology]] of a healthy [[human brain]] (unlike other therapies based on introspection, observation, or the stoic philosophical influences on [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]]). \\n* It is relatively easy to teach and easy to learn (doesn’t require identification of disorders or knowledge of medical terms). \\n* Clients define what is healthy thinking for them. \\n* Clients are coached to become their own therapists (Rational Behavior Self-Counseling).  \\n* In 1971, RBT psychiatrists pioneered visualization practices and the use of imagery to develop healthy thoughts, emotions and behaviors. \\n* Formulated psychosomatic learning theory and recognizes a specific form of cognitive-emotive dissonance as an inevitable stage in the process of voluntary change. It is an instance when as soon as one starts practicing the new behavior that is in conflict with old habits one begins experiencing a feeling as wrong, weird, or unnatural. That is the stage where people frequently, unfortunately, quit practicing.  \\n* It also accepts the potential health value of religious, spiritual, and deeply-rooted philosophical or existential beliefs, and their beneficial application and integration into a cognitive-behavioral, non-denominational, spiritual or existential counseling.

\\n What is EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY ?\\n\\nEducational technology may be defined as the arrangement of tools in order, that might prove helpful in advancing student learning. It includes systems that are used in the process of developing human capability. Technology can refer to the materials, tools; that humans use. some modern tools include LCD projectors,Laptop and Computers. Technology also means "applied science". In other words, any valid and reliable process or procedure that is derived from basic research using scientific method is considered technology. So,educational technology may be extended to include the techniques of the educators.\\n\\n\\n What are the importance of Educational Technology?\\n\\nEducational technology is very important to the humanities. Today, the instructor doesn't need to be in the same room where the learner is. All they need is an internet connection and they are ready to have a session of teaching. Today, learning becomes more interesting with the use of streaming audio and video or a Powerpoint presentation with voice overs. With the emergence of advanced technology, it is important that educators use these tools to their advantage to not only make teaching easier and more interesting but also to acquire more knowledge to their students.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can get more information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology
Our Children’s Place is a non-profit organization which aims at allowing young children, mostly infants and preschoolers to live with their mothers while the women serve out their sentences for nonviolent offenses. This initiative breaks the cycle of crime, poverty, substance abuse and family violence among generations as well as empowers the child with the help of his/her mother to enhance his/her social, cognitive, physical and emotional development. Ultimately, this project could allow many children to develop better inter-personal skills for their future by interacting with their mothers and will allow them a better chance at a successful future. Our Children’s Place was spear-headed by North Carolina Senator Ellie Kinniard in 2004. They are finally completing construction on a $3.5 million facility that will be able to hold ten women and twenty children, which will open in 2010. These women must be serving a sentence of three years or less and must be convicted of a non-violent crime. The children will receive free childcare, in addition to sessions with therapists and other health professionals. Our Children’s Place also works with H.A.T.S. (Handcrafted And Totally Special), an organization that allows female inmates and community members to create hats and other items.\\n\\n<ref></ref>http://ourchildrensplace.com/
'''OPEN INNOVATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY'''\\n\\n    Open Innovation is a new strategy which many industries, corporate houses and the like are applying in order to commercialize their internal IP (intellectual property) and to obtain a huge plethora of external innovations in order to commercialize them as well. In this approach, firms work and interact with external partners and create newer and better technologies and products and thereby benefitting from this interaction. In other words Open Innovation is also known as Commons based Peer Production. This term was coined by Harvard Law School Professor Yochai Benkler to portray a new model of economic production, in which the resourceful energy of a large number of people is coordinated with the aid of internet into projects without the usual hierarchical organization. Open Innovation actually means connecting external and internal ideas/technologies.\\n\\n    The basic premise of Open Innovation is: Keep your valuable proprietary to yourself and leave everything else to external innovation. Innovation is less about inventing new or building new things and more about coordinating good ideas for commercialization.

see: www.PedroBOrtiz.com\\n\\nSince June 2010, the world has reached the threshold where more than 50% of its population lives in cities. Growth of many metropolitan urban areas is experiencing an annual growth of 4% to 6%. This means a doubling of population each 15 years. It now takes only 15 years to grow as much as the regions did during the past 400 years. This phenomena is not natural growth nor even rapid growth. It can only be defined as explosive growth.\\n\\nThis phenomenon must be controlled to avoid the metastasis of slums that's currently taking place. If this is not addressed, these metropolises will be unsustainable and will not be incapable of competing in global markets. The World Bank is addressing this critical issue through its Urban Unit of the Sustainable Development Network, supporting the work done throughout the world by the Region Units (LAC, MENA, SSA, ECA, SEA, EPA). \\n\\nPedro Ortiz introduced a metropolitan growth methodology in the 1996 when he developed the Madrid Regional Plan, (the ORT, (Ordenacion Reticular del Territorio). This plan addressed the explosive growth Madrid was experiencing at that time (50% every 20 years). It was successful in controlling and monitoring the the city's growth in a sustainable manner (Spatial and Transport integrated policies). This methodology (Smart Metropolises: MetroCT Method) is now being enhanced and applied to numerous metropolises globally.

VIRUS IDENTIFICATION: A CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIVIRAL THERAPY\\nBiswendu B. Goswami, Ph.D.\\nUnited States Food and Drug Administration (Retired)\\nCurrent Address: 7624 Epsilon Drive, Derwood, MD 20855\\nTel:301-990-6940; \\nAbstract:\\nThe necessity for rapid methods of virus identification arose from the fact that human diseases caused by food-borne viruses range from infectious hepatitis to acute gastroenteritis. The viral causative agents run the gamut from simple single stranded RNA viruses (hepatitis A or infectious hepatitis), to more complex double stranded RNA viruses such as rotavirus and large single stranded RNA viruses such as corona virus. To complicate matters further, each of these virus species have dozens of genotypes ( each genome differing from the prototype by a few to hundreds of nucleotides, depending on the size of the genome. The number of human infections reported each year has made these viruses a major public health problem in the USA in recent years. Food-borne viruses have been associated with high morbidity and some mortality. Currently, other than disinfection guidelines, there are no effective control measures available for public health agencies to intervene in a meaningful way to reduce the incidence of food-borne infections. Viruses can be detected in both stool and vomitus, and the usual route of spread is via person to person. With the availability of more sensitive molecular diagnostics, increasingly outbreaks are reported where the initial source of the infection is contaminated food or water. For FDA (Food and Drug Administration), CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and ORA (Office of Regulatory Affairs), detection of the virus in clinical samples and contaminated food or water is essential to develop meaningful policies for control and prevention.\\nKeywords: Virus Identification; Microarray; Sequence independent target synthesis\\n2\\nIntroduction:\\nProcedures for virus identification is going through a revolution due to two recent developments. The orthodox methods for virus identification by cell culture followed by secondary confirmation by immunological or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques were too slow and labor intensive. PCR based methods have the added disadvantages they are extremely sensitive to impurities in the test material, and have very narrow specificity, requiring individual tests for each virus, and confirmation by sequencing is frequently a necessity to distinguish viral genotypes and sub-genotypes in a species..\\nMicroarray hybridization based techniques for the identification of known mutations in specific areas of viral genomes initially were successfully performed by synthesizing oligodeoxy nucleotide probes based on the sequence of wild-type and mutated viral genomes. The probes (individually synthesized) were then immobilized on solid supports by hand spotting, and later by automated programmable applicators that could handle several hundred probes [1] - [9]. An alternative to the traditional dye termination method of sequencing nucleic acids based on hybridization to oligonucleotide probes on solid support was developed in the 1990s [10]- [13].. However, the true potential for identification of viruses on a massive scale based on sequence of viral genomes did not take off until the development of in situ probe synthesis and immobilization techniques by [11] [14] ;[15]. These newer photolithographic techniques allowed for the synthesis and simultaneous immobilization of hundreds of thousands of probes in a single microarray allowing re-sequencing on a large scale by hybridization to identify virus genotypes. Wong et al., [16]Genome Res. 2007 or 2004?) used such an\\n3\\narray incorporating more than 383,000 probes to sequence the entire 29.7 kb genome of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (coronavirus). Since then, microarrays have been developed that can incorporate over two million probes , This development opened up the possibility of identifying multiple virus species and genotypes in a single experiment. However, to realize this potential, it is necessary to have a target synthesis method that is independent of the sequence of the viruses present in the test material.\\nThe new microarray based method developed in my laboratory at Food and Drug Administration (FDA), avoids PCR amplification with virus specific primers normally used for target synthesis in microarray experiments. However, it must be realized that PCR increases the number of specic targets by millions of folds, that makes very sensitive virus detection possible, As can be imagined, such sensitive detection is not possible without a means of target or signal amplification. This disadvantage in sensitivity is somewhat mitigated by the ability to amplify the signal produced by hybridization using biotin labeling of targets follwed by immunological detection of the biotin by Cy3 labeled streptavidin due to its strong affinity to biotin. A further signal amplification is possible by a second round of reaction with streptavidin foloowed by reaction with Cy3 labeled strptavidin. [17 ]. Detection and identification of any viral sequence is thus possible within this limitations, as,long as it’s sequence is represented in the array [17; 18;19]. Sensitivity may be further improved using modifications such as anti-sense RNA (aRNA) amplification.\\nConsidering the number of viral diseases extant in the world today, only a few of them are controllable by prophylactic use of vaccines. The ease with which viruses\\n4\\ndevelop resistance to vaccines is another major concern. Emergence of resistance viruses is difficult to detect by orthodox methods of cell culture, or even by conventional PCR. As an example , we can cite the experience in many third world countries , which at one time were considered free of poliovirus, but are now experiencing reemergence of this scourge, mainly due to the use of attenuated virus strains for vaccination, which then circulate within the population mainly through fecal contamination [5; 6]. This recirculation allows the virus to undergo multiple rounds of replication raising the possibility of mutations in the genome. A single or a handful of mutations in the genome gives rise to a resistance strain. It is not difficult to imagine a situation when other viruses now effectively controlled by vaccination will develop resistance to existing vaccines. The flu virus is a prime example. New Flu vaccines are needed to be developed almost every year due to development of resistance due to genome mutation [].\\nAn even more dangerous and potentially disastrous trend is developing in the United States where a false correlation between Thermosal , a mercury based preservative used in vaccines and Autism has been widely publicized. As a result, many parents now believe that it is preferable not to vaccinate the children to prevent development of Autism, and leave them exposed to risks of diseases such as polio and mumps. The faulty initial report has since been rescinded, but a potentially very dangerous movement has taken root.\\nFood-borne viruses have been recognized as a major challenge to public health for a number of years. Historically, paralytic poliomyelitis transmitted mainly by unpasteurized milk was an eye opener to public health agencies including FDA to the connection between unsafe foods and human health. The introduction of pasteurization\\n5\\nand subsequently the development of polio vaccines, and a national program for polio vaccination have made polio a thing of the past. Recently however, other food-borne viral illnesses have emerged to threaten the health and safety of a public that have become increasingly complacent due to the increased bacterial surveillance and implementation of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) throughout United States and Europe. Fortunately, it is much easier to detect bacteria in foods. Bacteria grow in simple media, which can then be identified by multiple methods [17, 20]. Despite this, frequent localized epidemics of E.coli and Salmonella from contaminated foods such as meat and vegetables are frequently reported. Virus detection in foods is much more difficult, because unlike bacteria they are obligatory intracellular parasites, and can only be grown with difficulty in cultured animal cell lines [1,2,3,5,7,9,16]. The time factor is of critical importance, and detection can only be achieved by extremely sensitive molecular methods such as PCR. More recently, attempts are being made to use the microarray techniques for virus detection [7; 9 21; 22; 23; 24; 25; 26; 27; 28]. Unfortunately, both types of methods are prone to false negative results, particularly when applied to food matrices. Laboratories are reluctant to invest in equipment and trained personnel because the success rate is so low. The success rate of virus detection is fairly high in body fluids and feces, because these sources have relatively high levels of virus contamination [5; 6; 16; 21; 22; 29; 30; 31. The success rate at FDA and other laboratories in virus detection in foods is very low as noted above, because we had to deal with foods, where contamination levels are naturally low. Moreover, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have the added advantage of hindsight [32]. They test specimens only from patients with overt signs of disease. But once a disease outbreak has occurred in a\\n6\\npopulation, control measures by the CDC are totally inadequate. Vaccines available are effective only prophylactically to prevent further spread of the disease among the non-infected population. Not knowing what food caused the disease outbreak, FDA is unable to advise the population to avoid certain types of food except in very general terms. Recommendations concerning the cleaning of food prior to cooking and consumption, also is hardly effective..\\nMost food-borne viruses have RNA genomes, with minimal viral functions necessary for virus propagation. As a result, development of chemical therapeutic agents has been very slow, with only a handful of agents such as Ribavirin [33] and a few other nucleoside analogs such as Xyloadenosine (XyloA) showing potential to be effective against certain viruses [34; 35; 36]. Interferon induced 2’-5’ linked oligoadenosine (2-5A) and its analogs have not been adequately tested [37; 38; 39]. Additionaly, food-borne RNA viruses are notoriously resistant to inactivation by physical or chemical agents [40; 41 ]. Chief among them in developed countries is norovirus (NV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV).. It is now a recognized fact that NV is the causal agent of most food-borne viral infections in the U.S., while other viruses such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), enteroviruses A and B (HEA and HEB) and rotavirus are also contributors. These illnesses can occur following consumption of contaminated food, person-to-person contact, or food contaminated by infected food handlers, or by contact with water contaminated by treated or untreated sewage [42].\\nA number of factors have compromised FDA’s ability to respond to this new threat by instituting adequate regulatory framework. Projects implemented by FDA have been top-heavy with much more emphasis on sophisticated methods of virus detection, while\\n7\\nthe problem resides in the isolation of low levels of virus from large quantities of suspected foods in a sufficiently pure form to be effectively detected by these ultrasensitive techniques [. We will address this gap in our ability to provide an underpinning of laboratory science by investigating new detection technologies that will allow FDA and other regulatory agencies such as CDC to respond to food-borne virus infections by identifying the viral agent, determining the source, and the relatedness and extent of such outbreaks, when discussing specific results [24;27]\\nMaterials and Methods\\nThe paradigm of virus detection technologies currently available is inadequate in several respects. The technology is mainly based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based amplification of viral nucleic acids. Since most food-borne viruses have an RNA genome, a process called reverse transcription (RT) to first transcribe viral RNA to cDNA is appended to the PCR procedure (called RT-PCR). This technology is two decades old [43] , although the application of this technology for virus detection in foods is more recent [24;27; 28;29;30; 31]. Several important modifications to the basic RT-PCR have been instituted, such as multiplex PCR [30], competitive PCR [32], real time PCR [23] ,which have increased the sensitivity of virus detection and reduced the time needed to obtain results. The major disadvantage of (real-time) RT-PCR for detection of an unknown virus is the specificity of most of these assays. For example, during an outbreak investigation samples will be screened for an etiologic agent that best matches the clinical symptoms when evaluable (norovirus and rotavirus for acute gastroenteritis and HAV for hepatitis) which may delay reporting if an unexpected etiologic agent is causing the outbreak [33]..\\n8\\nTo develop new high density oligonucleotide microarray methods with broad specificity for the sensitive detection and typing of foodborne viruses, these methods will have to be able to i) detect which virus is present, ii) the genogroup and genotype and if needed sub-genotype of the virus. This information could then be used to alert the regulatory agencies on the emergence of new virus strains which is currently not possible without sequencing multiple PCR products. Such detection processes will not be dependent on PCR amplification. Therefore, no prior knowledge of the nature of the virus or its genome sequence will be necessary. The same analyte will be used in a single experiment to obtain all the information needed to identify multiple viruses in the same sample. The high density oligonucleotide microarray based procedure has been used in combination with PCR amplification to study the evolution of the SARS coronavirus ([ 16], and bacterial genomes [20;17] as well as for the detection of mutations in the poliovirus genome ([6] . We have identified different types of HAV and HEA and HEB (more commonly known as coxsackieviruses A and B) viruses as well as studied the evolution of the wild type HAV genome HM175 to a cytopathic variant HM175/18f using a high density (> than 13,000 probes) microarray to detect the nucleotide changes accompanying this phenotypic change [18].\\nAdvances in microarray technology have allowed the identification of genetic variability over very long stretches of DNA in bacterial genomes [17; 20]. These newly developed high density microarrays contain thousands to hundreds of thousands of oligonucleotide probes, instead of a few dozen as used for detection of mutations in poliovirus genome during evolution from a vaccine strain to paralytic poliomyelitis strain [ 6 ; 5] in a single array thereby expanding the power of identification.\\n9\\nIsolation and labeling of Viral RNA. Viral RNA from HAV and CXKV strains were purified from 140 μl of virus cell culture supernatant with a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For norovirus samples, a 10% (wt/vol) stool suspension was prepared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 20 minutes. RNA was extracted from 140 μl to 280 μl of the supernatant with QIAamp viral RNA mini kit. The RNA samples were eluted in 50 μl of elution buffer and stored at -80 ºC until used. Reverse transcription was performed for one cycle (42 °C, 60 min) using random hexamer primers (Invitrogen, CA) followed by 15 min at 70 °C. This is essentially the initial step in current RT-PCR protocols. Reverse transcriptase requires a primer DNA or RNA) with a free 3’OH group hybridized to a template (DNA or RNA) to initiate cDNA synthesis. Viral RNAs that do not have a poly (A) sequence at their 3’end (such as rotavirus genomic RNA) cannot be primed by oligo (dT)15 and are primed by random hexamers. Resulting cDNA was fragmented with DNase I (Invitrogen, CA) at 37 °C for 1 min. Fragmented cDNA was labeled with Terminal Transferase (Invitrogen, CA) in the presence of biotin-11-ddATP (PerkinElmer, MA) at 37 °C for 4 hrs so that the fragmentwd cDNA is extended by a single nucleotide, which does not change its hybridization characteristis to the probes in the array..\\nThe biotin labeled synthesized targets are then hybridized to the probes on the microarray. Following a series of washes, the hybridized targets are reacted with Cy3 labeled streptavidin. After further washes to remove unreacted Cy3 coupled strptavidin, hybridized targets are detected by Cy3 fluorescence by scanning the array.\\n10\\nA typical result is shown in Fig.1... Computer analysis of the signal by software developed for this purpose is used to identify the virus species, genogroup and the strain within the genogroup.\\nMicroarray Hybridization, Scanning, and Data Analysis. Microarray hybridization was performed using the Affymetrix protocol. Briefly, Biotinylated cDNA in the presence of Affymetrix hybridization buffer was hybridized to the microarray chip in a total volume of 120 μl. Before application to the array, the samples were heated to 98 °C for 1 min, cooled at 45 °C for another 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 5 min. The microarray chip was then incubated at 45 °C for 16 hrs in a hybridization oven. Following hybridization, the wash and stain procedures were carried out by the Fluidics station (Affymetrix, CA). All arrays were imaged by using Affymetrix microarray scanner at a resolution of 10 μm per pixel. Signal intensity of the hybridization was extracted by using Affymetrix power tools, and the subsequent data analysis was performed using MS Excel. For each viral genome represented on the array, the average signal intensity for all the probes within that genome was determined. The average intensity is first determined as described by Jackson et al. (16), and Ayodeji et al. (17). Each average genome intensity was then normalized by the average intensity of all the probes represented on the array. To minimize effects of nonspecific hybridization, an empirical cutoff value of 3 was considered as a threshold value for a positive signal. Microarray hybridization data were then converted to color visualization schemes in which hybridization signal intensity is reflected by the color scale of vertical strips.\\nMicroarray design:\\n11\\nAll microarrays used in this study were customer ordered to be fabricated by Affymetrix Inc. (Santa Clara, CA) using a maskless array synthesis technology (Singh-Gasson et al., 1999; Nuwaysir et al., 2002. The tiling microarray contained 25-mer oligonucleotide probes which were designed to detect common food-borne viruses including hepatitis A virus, norovirus, coxsackievirus, rotavirus, hepatitis E virus, and astrovirus as well as saporovirus. All viral genetic sequence data were obtained from database of viral genomes from Genbank. The chips were composed of overlapping 25-mer oligonucleotides which covered 3,000 bp sequences from 5’ end viral genomes of each virus. Each sequence of interest was tiled with the 25-mer probes with 2-bp spacing. The microarray representation of common foodborne viruses are listed in Tables. 1 to 6 along with specific hybridization signal intensities that reflect relatedness of virus strains within the same species..\\nThe design of the microarray follows closely the protocol we have recently described ([39]Ayodeji et al. 2009; Chen at al. [41}). However, instead of 13,000 probes, these arrays each contain 100,000 probes covering every complete and partial sequences available in the database for NoV, HAV, HEA, HEB and RV. We also developed probes covering the entire sequence of several individual viral genome sequences. . Probes are designed to have a 2 base overlap i.e., each probe starts at the 2nd nucleotide of every sequence, thereby covering a 7.5kb genome with about 1500 probes. 7.5 kb is the average size of the RNA genome of a common food-borne virus except rotavirus that has a segmented double stranded RNA genome, where each segment RNA is 1.5 to 2kbp long. Alternatively, the 5 base overlap between consecutive probes may be reduced to increase the number of probes to cover the same sequence Since the capacity of the\\n12\\nmicroarrays (up to 2 million probes) far exceeds the number of probes in our current array design (100,000), we could incorporate probes covering more viruses, although not all virus groups were tested for this study. However, these served the purpose of negative controls to show that false positives were not seen. For target synthesis for these experiments, we have investigated whether viral targets can be obtained in sufficient quantities in a sequence non-specific manner to hybridize to a high density microarray containing greater than 100,000 probes representing all the known sequences (partial or complete) of the major foodborne viruses (NV, HAV, HEA, HEB and rotaviruses) and identify the viral strain (or strains) present in a sample.\\nRESULTS\\nTables1to 6 show the lists the selected enteric viruses and the number of probes for each strain of virus that were synthesized directly on the FDA_EVIR microarray by photolithography whereby the total number of probes on the array is 91542. Selected regions of several enteric viruses’ genomes were tiled at two nucleotide spacing. Each probe is 25 nucleotides long and there is a 23 base-pair overlap between consecutive probes for the same virus genotype; therefore, the complete array covers 183,084 nucleotides of viral genomic sequence. The probe numbers we used for each strain of HAV for the sequence coverage of several HAV strains belonging to HAV genogroups I to III are shown in Table 1.. But no attempt was made to include all the partial sequences that exist in the database., although we included some of the VP1-2 and VP3 regions, that are reported to contain maximum sequence conservation.\\n13\\nTable 1.

They included HM-175/18f, HAS-15, and PA21, which represented genotype IB, IA, and IIIA, respectively.

Although cross-hybridization within different genotype strains in HAV genus occurred, this was expected due to less divergence among genotypes of HAV. Stronger hybridization signal was obtained between specific genotype viral RNA and array elements derived from the same genotypic virus. Based on the hybridization pattern and the sequence information of the probes, it is clearly possible to detect and type HAV.\\nOur results indicate that the microarray hybridization technique can be applied to the identification of different viruses present in a sample and detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) to identify closely related viral strains belonging to the same species [35](Ayodeji et al. 2009). However, the current protocols for SARS virus ([16]Wong et al., 2004), poliovirus ([5]Cherkasova et al., 2003; [6]Laassri et al., 2005),\\n17\\nand rotavirus ([38]Honma et al., 2007; [3]Chizhikov, et al., 2002), still depend on RT-PCR for target synthesis to be used in hybridization experiments. Using virus-specific RT-PCR assays requires prior knowledge of the virus to be expected in the sample hence potentially missing other viral disease agents that may be present in the sample but go undetected. Since current microarray allow of the use of up to 2 million probes in a single array, the potential for the detection and identification of many viral disease agents in a single experiment is not fully realized.\\nIn our laboratory, we have investigated whether viral targets can be obtained in sufficient quantities in a sequence non-specific manner to hybridize to a high density microarray containing greater than 100,000 probes representing all the known sequences (partial or complete) of the major foodborne viruses (NV, HAV, HEA, HEB and rotaviruses) and identify the viral strain (or strains) present in a sample. Synthesis of cDNA in a non-sequence specific manner was accomplished by reverse transcription of viral RNA using a mixture of random hexamers or olig(dT)15 to prime cDNA synthesis using viral RNA as template by AMV reverse transcriptase. This is essentially the initial step in current RT-PCR protocols. Reverse transcriptase requires a primer DNA or RNA) with a free 3’OH group hybridized to a template (DNA or RNA) to initiate cDNA synthesis. Viral RNAs that do not have a poly (A) sequence at their 3’end (such as rotavirus genomic RNA) cannot be primed by oligo (dT)15 and are primed by random hexamers. We then label the cDNA (see below for details). The synthesized targets are then hybridized to the probes on the microarray and the array scanned for hybridization signal (see Fig.1). Computer analysis of the signal by software developed for this\\n18\\npurpose is used to identify the virus species, genogroup and the strain within the genogroup.\\nSimaltaneous Detection of Mulitple HAV Genotypes\\nDetection of Noroviruses.\\nTo access the applicability of the tiling microarray for norovirus identification in a clinical setting, we examined three stool specimens isolated from infected patients.

The samples including noro#1, noroGI and #3263 have been genotyped via quantitative RT-PCR. They all belonged to genogroup I. As anticipated, hybridization to genogroup I-specific norovirus-derived oligoprobes was detected in all three virus samples. No cross-hybridization to noro genogroup II oligoprobes was observed. In sample of GI and #3263, strong hybridization to genogroup I specific sequence L07418 was obtained. In the meantime, hybridization to genogroup I specific sequence DQ340089 was also observed, whose signal was slightly lower than cut-off value. (Fig.2, 3). Viral RNA isolated from sample #1 was hybridized to a number of genogroup I-specific oligoprobes without cross-hybridization to genogroup II-specific oligoprobes (Fig. 4). Detailed nucleotide sequence identity with positive signal was listed in Table.5.\\nSaitamaU17 (GII)Fig 2.

A mixture of cDNA derived from the three viruses was hybridized to the microarray chip. As shown in Fig. 5, CXKV B3 displayed a clear-cut hybridization pattern distinguishable from other coxsackieviruses, making it possible to determine the virus serotype; Strong hybridization to the genotype IB oligoprobes was observed in HAV HM-175/18f although cross-hybridization to genotype IA oligoprobes also occurred (Table.6). In all positive hybridization, the average signal intensity ratio of IB-specific oligoprobes was 8.3 while IA was 4.2, which indicated that the array elements are capable of detecting and typing HAV. Good hybridization was observed between #3263 and genogroup I oligoprobes derived from noro1 L07418 sequence with signal intensity ratio of 3.9 (Table.6). Fig 5.

The insert shows close-up view of positively hybridized sequences derived from each virus.\\n23\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe long term objective is to use this technique to identify any viral agent present in the sample without investigator bias. Thus the proposed technological change will reveal a true picture of the viral disease agent and not just the confirmation of a notion based on vague symptoms of a disease. This is particularly important because many of the enteroviruses often show similar disease symptoms. It will also enable us to determine whether multiple strains or virus species are involved in a disease outbreak. Although we deem it unnecessary, the outcome of a microarray detection experiment can be independently verified using the more conventional PCR based amplification and sequencing or a second round of hybridization to a more narrowly focused less complex microarray with fewer probe features. We believe that the strength of the microarray technique is in the redundancy of probes used to interrogate a particular sequence making the technique essentially error-free. Variations in the probe sequences in the form of mutated probe oligonucleotides can be included in the array design to further increase the fidelity of virus identification and confidence in the result.\\nNoroviruses (NoV) and to a lesser extent HAV and human rotavirus (RV) are the most common foodborne viruses. Othe picornaviruses such as human enteric viruses A and B have at least the potential to be transmitted via person to person contact, through infected food handlers and contaminated foods. Current epidemiological studies indicate that NoV is responsible for the vast majority of food borne outbreaks in developed countries. The time frame of gastrointestinal disease caused by NoV is very unique due to the rapid onset of symptoms and easier to spot and a correlation to specific food consumption easier to establish that other viruses such as HEA or HEB or RV. The\\n24\\nsecond most common foodborne virus HAV has a rather long incubation period before disease symptoms become apparent. Epidemiological correlation to any specific food consumption thus is rather difficult to establish.\\nThe detection of food-borne viruses in clinical samples (mainly stool samples from outbreak investigations) is extremely difficult using cell culture due to the inability to grow NV and HAV in cultured cells. Hence molecular methods such as real-time RT-PCR are currently used for the detection of foodborne viruses in clinical samples. The current hypothesis developed from this need to broaden the scope of detection without sacrificing the sensitivity and rapidity of detection and the need to obtain more information from an experiment that is currently possible with RT-PCR.\\nThe strategy behind this proposal is to investigate whether food-borne virus detection and identification based on high density microarray hybridization currently being developed at Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) can be utilized for routine virus detection in FDA and other agencies such as CDC and Office of Regulatory Research (ORA) for the rapid detection and unambiguous identification (genotyping) of these viral disease agents from diverse source materials. Due to time limitation, we will concentrate our efforts on the detection of virus from stool samples from outbreak investigations available from CDC. Currently, outbreak investigations are geared to detecting and broad genogroup identification of the most common food borne virus NV. Due to the relative low frequency of other foodborne viral diseases, these viruses are usually not targeted. However, RNA virus populations are highly heterogeneous even within a particular genogroup, and genogroup identification using PCR primers based on consensus sequences are unable to identify the particular strain within the genogroup.\\n25\\nAnalysis of outbreak strain identification is therefore incomplete, since a particular strain within a genogroup may be responsible for the outbreak being studied. In addition, the narrow focus on a particular species of virus ignores other viruses that are also food-borne and may be present in a particular outbreak, which could have provided valuable information as to the source o[[File:Example.jpg]]f the outbreak.\\nConclusion:\\nWe hypothesize that advanced microarray design that incorporates probes for multiple virus species and strains will be able to provide the needed information to pinpoint the exact strain of the virus responsible for the outbreak, and also provide information as to the presence of other viruses that may be associated with that outbreak.\\nStatistical significance of array hybridization signals is computed using array package software where data points are calculated as signal intensity above normalized background (corrected to internal standards) and converted to average probe intensity (Jackson et al. 2007; Wong et al. 2004). Viral samples in the form of stool samples from outbreak investigations will be provided by CDC (NoV) and CBER (RV). The samples will have been typed by specific RT-PCR based methods prior to coding and then supplied to us for microarray experiments. Any initial negative hybridization will trigger a re-sampling and analysis due to the possibility of sampling error or a negative (no virus) sample. Sampling error rates and percent positive identification (following code breakage) will be used to determine statistical success rate of the microarray analysis. We realize that a sample with very low viral load may produce poor hybridization signal. In that case, the viral RNA will be amplified in a sequence non-specific manner using T7 RNA polymerase to preserve the original distribution.\\n26\\nThe success of our microarray screening protocol depends on target synthesis that is not specific to any particular virus. In our preliminary experiments we have achieved target synthesis for our microarray hybridization experiments by eliminating the PCR step by relying on a highly efficient synthesis and labeling of target. Viral RNA was purified from the all virus containing stool samples with a QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer primers. The resultant cDNA is fragmented by DNase 1 digestion and the mixture of the fragments is labeled with biotin-11-ddATP (PerkinElmer, MA) in the presence of Terminal Transferase (Invitrogen, CA). The use of ddATP assures that only a single nucleotide is added to the 3’end of each cDNA fragments and therefore the hybridization characteristics to the oligo-probes on the array is not altered. For signal amplification at the end of hybridization, the biotin in the target now hybridized to the probe is reacted with cy3 labeled streptavidin. The cy3 is detected by scanning and the scans analyzed for the detection of hybridization to specific probes on the array. An example of a typical result is shown in Fig.1. The applicability of this protocol in detecting a single species of virus is shown in Fig.2. The experiment detected genogroup I of NV, with the two peaks of average intensities identifying two different strains. Significantly, the microarray detected two different strains of group I NV in the same sample. The smaller peak has a 91% sequence identity to the main peak supporting our hypothesis (see above) that outbreak samples may contain multiple NV strains that can only be detected using microarray.\\nThe second hypothesis that we propose to test is that microarray hybridization can detect multiple viruses in the same experiment if the target is synthesized and labeled\\n27\\nusing technology that are not dependent on sequence specific PCR amplification. An example is shown in Fig.5 from a recent experiment carried out in our laboratory. RNA samples from three different viruses HAV (genotype HM175), NoV (Group I) and HEB (strain CVB 3) were separately reverse transcribed and labeled as described above. The labeled cDNAs were mixed in equimolar quantities and hybridized. Analysis of hybridization data show that all three viruses were identified. In addition to the HAV and CV strains, the array experiment again identified two closely related strains of NoV as seen in Fig.2, that could not be distinguished by RT-PCR.\\nExpected Outcomes:\\nExperiments performed in different laboratories that have used microarray technology for virus detection and identification have concluded that the potential benefits of the use of microarrays in diagnostic settings is very high. The ability of the microarray for virus identification is attested by the proliferation of virus species that are being examined using this technology (Wong et al., 2004 for SARS coronavirus, Laasari et al. 2005, for Poliovirus, Honma et al. 2007, Chizikov et al. 2002, for rotavirus, Ryabinin et al. 2006, for orthopox virus, Deregt et al. 2006, for swine fever virus, Ayodeji et al. 2009, for hepatitis A and human enteric viruses A and B. The dependence on RT-PCR for target synthesis however has restricted the realization of the full potential of the microarray for multiple virus identification in a single experiment. We have shown by eliminating the PCR step during target synthesis that NoV, HAV and human enterovirus can be identified in the same analyte (Fig.3). Comparison of hybridization intensities from targets synthesized from two different strains of the same virus species can identify nucleotide changes in the virus genome occurring over time (Wong et al. 2004; Ayodeji et.al.\\n28\\n2009). As shown in Fig.3, perhaps the greatest advantage of this technique is to identify a virus strain in the absence of any prior knowledge of the sequence of the virus in the sample by eliminating the need for PCR. Eliminating the need for PCR does not reduce the sensitivity to the level that the virus can no longer be detected (Fig.3). Conceivably it is possible that such a situation will be encountered in samples with very low viral load. In such cases a sequence non-specific RNA amplification procedure may be used to increase the sensitivity. We have to yet test this hypothesis. The other advantage accruing to the agency will be the ability to identify emerging virus strains which are not detectable due to change of sequence at the PCR primer binding site on the genome, and the need for sequencing every PCR product.\\nCurrently, a vaccine against HAV, the second most prevalent foodborne disease is available for prophylactic use. However, a vaccine against NoV is not available to prevent NoV outbreaks. Even where a vaccine for a particular virus is available, vaccination programs to prevent viral disease outbreaks have to be initiated well in advance of a disease outbreak in order to allow time for the targeted population to develop immunity. Another drawback is that viruses frequently mutate to escape immunity as well as to become resistant to antivirals. The microarray data can be of value to provide indication to health officials if resistance strains are emerging and provide sufficient time to change the strategy for controlling an outbreak.\\nEND END\\n29\\nAcknowledgement:\\nThe author wishes to acknowledge the full financial support of the Food and Drug Administration for the work carried out while he was an employee of the Federal Government of the United States of America.\\nReferences:\\n[1] Verhoef LPB, Kroneman A, van Duynhoven Y, Boshuizen H, van Pelt W, Koopmans M.

Briefly, Biotinylated cDNA in the presence of Affymetrix hybridization buffer was hybridized to the microarray chip in a total volume of 120 μl. Before application to the array, the samples were heated to 98 °C for 1 min, cooled at 45 °C for another 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 5 min. The microarray chip was then incubated at 45 °C for 16 hrs in a hybridization oven. Following hybridization, the wash and stain procedures were carried out by the Fluidics station (Affymetrix, CA). All arrays were imaged by using Affymetrix microarray scanner at a resolution of 10 μm per pixel. Signal intensity of the hybridization was extracted by using Affymetrix power tools, and the subsequent data analysis was performed using MS Excel. For each viral genome represented on the array, the average signal intensity for all the probes within that genome was determined. The average intensity is first determined as described by Jackson et al. (16), and Ayodeji et al. (17). Each average genome intensity was then normalized by the average intensity of all the probes represented on the array. To minimize effects of nonspecific hybridization, an empirical cutoff value of 3 was considered as a threshold value for a positive signal. Microarray hybridization data were then converted to color visualization schemes in which hybridization signal intensity is reflected by the color scale of vertical strips.\\nValidation of Norovirus Microarray Genotyping. To confirm the microarray genotyping result of the norovirus sample #186 (NoV#186), we performed a specific PCR with a published primer set G1SKF (5’-CTGCCCGAATTYGTAAATGA-3’) and G1SKR (5’-CCAACCCARCCATTRTACA-3’); G2SKF (5’-\\n34\\nCNTGGGAGGGCGATCGCAA-3’) and G2SKR (5’-CCRCCNGCATRHCCRTTRTACAT-3’; Y=C/T; N=A/T/G/C; R=A/G; H=A/T/C). This pair of primer was used for the amplification of genogroup I and group II norovirus. (Kojima, S., Kageyama, T., Fukushi, S.,et.al. (2002). Genogroup-specific PCR primers for detection of nowalk-like viruses. J Virol Methods. 100: 107-114.) The PCR was carried out as described previously (Kojima, S. above). The amplicon was sequenced and its relationship to known NoV strains were determined by phylogentics analysis program ClustalX as described by Thompson et. al. (1997). (Thompson J.D., Gibson,T.J., Plewniak,F., Jeanmougin,F. and Higgins,D.G. (1997) The CLUSTAL_X windows interface: flexible strategies for multiple sequence alignment aided by quality analysis tools. Nucleic Acids Res., 25, 4876–4882.). A phylogentic tree from boot-strap analysis was generated by Neibour-Joining method. Other norovirus samples were genotyped by Dr. William Burkhardt (FDA, Dauphin Island, AL) and by Dr. Jan Vinje (CDC, Atlanta, GA) via RT-PCR.\\nHybridization Profile of coxsackieviruses A and B and different strains of HAV\\n35\\nCXKV A2Fig 1.

Viral samples in the form of stool samples from outbreak investigations will be provided by CDC (NoV) and CBER (RV). The samples will have been typed by specific RT-PCR based methods prior to coding and then supplied to us for microarray experiments. Any initial negative hybridization will trigger a re-sampling and analysis due to the possibility of sampling error or a negative (no virus) sample. Sampling error rates and percent positive identification (following code breakage) will be used to determine statistical success rate of the microarray analysis. We realize that a sample with very low viral load may produce poor hybridization signal. In that case, the viral RNA will be amplified in a sequence non-specific manner using T7 RNA polymerase to preserve the original distribution.\\nIsolation and labeling of Viral RNA:\\nThe success of our microarray screening protocol depends on target synthesis that is not specific to any particular virus. In our preliminary experiments we have achieved target synthesis for our microarray hybridization experiments by eliminating the PCR step by relying on a highly efficient synthesis and labeling of target. Viral RNA was purified from the all virus containing stool samples with a QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer primers. The resultant cDNA is fragmented by DNase 1 digestion and the mixture of the fragments is labeled with biotin-11-ddATP (PerkinElmer, MA) in the presence of Terminal Transferase (Invitrogen, CA). The use of\\n39\\nddATP assures that only a single nucleotide is added to the 3’end of each cDNA fragments and therefore the hybridization characteristics to the oligo-probes on the array is not altered. For signal amplification at the end of hybridization, the biotin in the target now hybridized to the probe is reacted with cy3 labeled streptavidin. The cy3 is detected by scanning and the scans analyzed for the detection of hybridization to specific probes on the array. An example of a typical result is shown in Fig.1. The applicability of this protocol in detecting a single species of virus is shown in Fig.2. The experiment detected genogroup I of NV, with the two peaks of average intensities identifying two different strains. Significantly, the microarray detected two different strains of group I NV in the same sample. The smaller peak has a 91% sequence identity to the main peak supporting our hypothesis (see above) that outbreak samples may contain multiple NV strains that can only be detected using microarray.\\nThe second hypothesis that we propose to test is that microarray hybridization can detect multiple viruses in the same experiment if the target is synthesized and labeled using technology that are not dependent on sequence specific PCR amplification. An example is shown in Fig.3 from a recent experiment carried out in our laboratory. RNA samples from three different viruses HAV (genotype HM175), NoV (Group I) and HEB (strain CVB 3) were separately reverse transcribed and labeled as described above. The labeled cDNAs were mixed in equimolar quantities and hybridized. Analysis of hybridization data show that all three viruses were identified. In addition to the HAV and CV strains, the array experiment again identified two closely related strains of NoV as seen in Fig.2, that could not be distinguished by RT-PCR.
Individualist cultures are those in which people are on a whole loosely connected to each other and prefer to be identified as an individual. Self-importance, promotion, and achievement are highly valued. Competition is encouraged more than cooperation. Individualist cultures expect one to act for self-promotion and self-advancement in the job market. There is also competitiveness in social situations,where people are expected to fend for themselves and any sign of assistance (i.e. - getting set-up on a blind date)can be seen as a sign of weakness. Parental approval is helpful to have in situations such as marriage, but not necessary. People in an individualist culture place more importance on their own interests than the interests of other members of the culture.\\n\\nIndividualistic cultures place emphasis on the "I"consciousness.  These cultures are very competitive and self-centered, as opposed to the cooperation and loyalty focused values of a collectivist culture.  Individualistsvalue their privacy and usually indentify themselves as independent from the group indentity.  The JMU campus, for example, is largely individualistic.  The faculty, staff, and students of JMU are not necessarily unfriendly or unhelpful towards one another, but each student is competitive for the top grades and academic standing.  One will rarely ever witness a college student studying for hours on end in order to help his or her classmate achieve an A on an exam. Overall, individualist cultures emphasize individual goals,independence, privacy, and self-help.
==Quantitative Taxonomy of Wikipedia Editors==\\n\\n===Abstract===\\nSome quantitative methods for categorizing Wikipedia editors and their editing styles are described. \\n\\n===Introduction===\\nWikipedia is one of the most popular websites on the internet. It is composed of several million articles written in over 250 different languages. Wikipedia is created by  thousands of volunteer editors, who are guided by a set of policies, principles, guidelines, conventions and traditions. Different editors are involved in a wide variety of tasks, and exhibit different editing styles. \\n\\nThere are many reasons to categorize editing styles on Wikipedia. For example, not all editing styles contribute equally to the production of Wikipedia, and it is valuable to understand which styles are more useful to Wikipedia and in what circumstances. Recognizing unproductive or inefficient behavior and measuring it's characteristics  can be useful in the creation of evidence-based management systems, which hopefully will replace the current intuition-based management systems. For example, when selecting editors for promotion to administrative positions, or other positions of responsibility, current methods can skew the selection process towards those with limited forms of editing experience. Gauging editing styles and experiences can allow a conscious decision to avoid certain kinds of editors, to create a wider diversity of candidates, or to otherwise assist in the selection process. Also, measuring the results of certain administrative actions or imposition of policy changes can be valuable information for evaluating the appropriateness of these actions and changes.\\n\\nQuantitative methods of analysis are often desirable. Quantitative methods are amenable to automation and computer implementation, which is appropriate for a computer-based document production project.  Numerically-based procedures can reveal features of situations that are not readily apparent to less exacting and rigorous methods.
What UP does:\\n\\nUP is a group of under-30s based in London in the UK who want to support people of their own age affected by depression. Their aim is to raise awareness of depression, promote understanding of mental health issues and work to reduce the stigma that might prevent depression sufferers seeking help. UP is there to encourage seeking the best support to help individuals, families and friends learn to overcome the illness, improve quality of life and realise potential.\\n\\nUP is part of the Charlie Waller Memorial Trust (CWMT).\\n\\nWhy target young people?\\n\\nDepression is widespread among the under-30s. This age group often struggle to cope with the pressures of education, work, money, relationships and simply finding their way in the world. Sadly, it is also the age group most likely to try to cover up any mental health issues.\\n\\nUnwarranted shame, lack of information or believing that this age group should just ’pull their socks up‘ mean that they’re often unable to admit to friends, family or even themselves that something’s wrong. But with depression, something is badly wrong.\\n\\nUP believes it shouldn’t be this way. UP promotes finding the correct treatment, that really works; currently in the UK there’s no clear path to getting help. Often the most common answer to the question “what would you do if you felt depressed, or worried that a friend might be?” is “I don’t know”. UP wants to answer that question and provide a gateway to the support that may be needed.
=World War II: Mobilization=\\n<br/>\\n==Introduction==\\n<br/>\\n   World War II was the largest and most violent armed conflict in the history of mankind. However, the half century that now separates \\nus from that conflict has exacted its toll on our collective knowledge. While World War II continues to absorb the interest of military scholars and historians, as well as its veterans, a generation of Americans has grown to maturity largely unaware of the political, social, and military implications of a war that, more than any other, united us as a people with a common purpose.\\n\\n \\n\\n   Highly relevant today, World War II has much to teach us, not only about the profession of arms, but also about military preparedness, global strategy, and combined operations in the coalition war against fascism. During the next several years, the U.S. Army will participate in the nation's 50th anniversary commemoration of World War II. The commemoration will include the publication of various materials to help educate Americans about that war. The works produced will provide great opportunities to learn about and renew pride in an Army that fought so magnificently in what has been called "the mighty endeavor."\\n\\n \\n\\nWorld War II was waged on land on sea, and in the air over several diverse theaters of operation for approximately six years. The following essay on the wartime mobilization effort supplements a series of studies on the Army's campaigns of that war.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis brochure was prepared in the U.S. Army Center of Military History by Frank N. Schubert. I hope this absorbing account of that period will enhance your appreciation of American achievements during World War II.\\n\\n \\n\\nGORDON R. SULLIVAN\\n\\nGeneral, United States Army\\n\\nChief of Staff
'''What is Sustainable Tourism?'''\\n\\nSustainable tourism is a form of tourism that provides economic, social, and environmental benefits through the knowledgeable management of tourism resources. Long-term sustainability is achieved without losing any local cultural identity or natural values.\\n\\nBoth tourist operators and tourists can help achieve sustainable tourism.\\n\\n'''What kinds of tourism are sustainable?'''\\n \\nECOTOURISM : Ecotourism is a form of tourism that occurs in natural areas and integrates the local socio-cultural identity with ecosystem considerations. It promotes a sustainable ecosystem through a participatory environmental management processes involving all stakeholders.\\n \\nHEALTH TOURISM : Health tourism is a form of tourism involving activities that deliberately promote good health. Examples of health tourism include visiting exercise or meditation centres or resorts that provide health services or specialise in vegetariam food. Such visits are typically of a specified duration, such as 3,5, or 7 days.\\n \\nAGROTOURISM : Agrotourism is a form of tourism in agricultural areas such as orchards, agroforestry farms, herbal farms and animal farms, which have been prepared in some way for the tourists. More importantly, tourists gain experience in farming activities such as working with animals or harvesting crops, usually under the supervision of a farm guide. Lecture describing the operation of the farm may also be given.\\n \\nCULTURAL TOURISM : Cultural tourism is a form of tourism that allows tourists to admire and learn about local cultures and tradition. The local community participates in the management of this form of tourism, which is based on the principle of conserving local culture and the environment. Examples of culture-based tourism include visiting the Royal Court or experiencing local life in a hill-tribe village\\n\\n'''Every kind of existing tourism operation can become Sustainable Tourism if tourism managers take responsibility for the destinations socio-cultural and natural environment.'''
After practicing law for 29+ years I am amazed that I seem to be the only counsel that has been consistently using the term "fraudulator" to define, generally, one who actively engages in fraudulent, deceptive, and misrepresentative type behavior.  Fraud is precisely defined in Federal and State statutes, and has become part of American and English lexicon in terms of "common law" deliberate deceptions for unfair and/or unlawful gain and advantage.  It is also generally defined as a swindle or a trick, and has been known to describe an imposter.\\n\\nBut, I have yet to see or read about anyone who is consistently or chronically involved in this type of conduct as being a "FRAUDULATOR".\\n\\nI believe this word should be added to common dictionaries and particularly "BLACK's LAW DICTIONARY" as a word that best articulates the true sense of the root-word, Fraud, when describing an individual and/or entity that engages in intentional fraudulent and deceptive conduct.  \\n\\nThank you in advance for your comments.
                                      '''\\n                                        '''''Contemporary society''''' ''                \\n\\nContemporary society, according to social and political scientists, is characterised by at least three fundamental directions:\\n* '''increasing human interconnection''' through a network of relationships that is progressively covering the whole planet;\\n* '''the pace and depth of the evolution of human ways of life''' determined by technological innovation represent an absolute novelty in human history;\\n* the scale of '''anthropological and and ecological transformation''' due to the interaction between evolutionary factors (social, cultural, economic, and technological) has no historical precedent.\\n\\nThese directions are the result of a number of fundamental changes that are irreversibly transforming our daily lives, our way of thinking and perceiving the world and our way of living together. Among these fundamental changes are: improvements in life conditions, life expectancy, literacy and gender equality; changes in domestic and international political institutions; and the breakdown of natural equilibria.\\n\\n\\n==Improvement of life conditions==\\nThe UN estimates that, at the beginning of the 20th century, about 60% of the world population lived in conditions of extreme poverty. In 1981, 40% of the world population lived extreme poverty. In 2001, the percentage had been halved to 20%.\\nSeveral developing countries, in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa, still suffer from social and economic backwardness, but life conditions have significantly improved in most regions of the world, in particular in Asia. \\nThe overall improvement in life conditions and the role of technologies now available have contributed to increase GDP per capita by one and a half times in less than half a century (1960-2005), with peaks of over eight times in Eastern Asia. Only in a few countries, concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, growth of per capita income has been very slow.\\n\\n\\n==Life expectancy==\\nIn 1960, the average life expectancy of the world population was 50 years. Forty-five years later, in 2004, life expectancy had improved by over 30% to 67 years. Improvements in health care and the reduction in child mortality have led to a jump forward in middle-income countries, where life expectancy is now over 70 years. In high-income countries life expectancy is now over 80 years, extending well beyond the traditional length of working life, causing social and economic problems.\\n\\n\\n==Literacy and gender equality==\\nThe ability to read and write is next to universal: in 2004, 80% of adult men and 73% of adult women had basic literacy skills. Of great social importance is the rapid growth of female school enrollment and the increasing presence of women in the labour market. These deep changes constitute a primary driver of economic growth in developing countries.\\nFemale literacy has great consequences in terms of fertility. When female school enrollment and employment rates increase, fertility rates decline rapidly and tend to stabilise around the natural rate of reproduction of 2.1 children per women (see E. Todd, "After the Empire"). Several demographers believe that, as a consequence, world population will stabilise over the next few decades, at a level compatible with the resources of the planet [reference].\\n\\n\\n==Spread of communication technologies==\\nThe world population has a number of "passive" (broadcasting) communication technologies (radio, television) that cover the whole globe. Moreover, a large portion of the population uses "active" commmunication technologies (telephone, internet). Internet connections are expanding rapidly: in 2004 there were 140 Internet users every 1000 inhabitants (according to data from the "International Communication Union"). The spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) is remodelling the material fundaments of society. The sociologist [[Manuel_Castells|Castells]] believes that these technologies have started a revolution of the productive structures of society and of daily life.\\n\\nThe new communication technologies represent a critical instrument to obtain consensus and as a result they are transforming the organisational models of the State and of politics. The power system becomes less visible but more pervasive in the way it can influence choices and ways of thinking Manuel_Castells|M. Castells]], "Galassia Internet", Feltrinelli, [[2002]]).\\n\\n\\n==Economic growth and evolution of political institutions==\\nThe economic success of authoritarian regimes, mainly in Asia, suggests that (at least in the short term) economic growth is independent from the democratisation of political institutions. However, economic development favours the development of democratic institutions--but only if economic growth leads to substantial changes in cultural and social structures. ([[Ronald Inglehart|R. Inglehart]], "La società postmoderna").\\nThe "World Values Survey", which captures political values in 43 countries, shows that no country with a per capita income below the poverty line has democratic or free institutions. Almost the totality of nations with high per capita income are classified as democratic.\\n\\n==Globalisation==\\nOver the last fifty years, world GDP has increased by about five times, while trade has increased ten-fold over the same period. These data suggests that the intensity of the commercial exchange between countries has developed faster than the overall economy. However, globalisation has gone beyond the exchange of physical commodities and it is progressively modelling also the lifestyles and consumption patterns of individuals and societies. The Swiss think-tank KOF has developed a number of globalisation indicators that show the increasing development of global individual, social and commercial networks.\\n\\n\\n==Social tension and opposition to change==\\nNew international flows have diminished the role of traditional political institutions--sometimes with negative consequences for social stability. In many societies, stability (or slow evolution) has been substituted by unstoppable and irreversable transformations.\\nAs a result, individuals and communities perceive a high degree of insecurity--insecurity that touches every aspect of their lives. Growing masses of people feel threatened by the changes that affect their material (work, income, house), psychological (personal relationships), and cultural life (with the need to continuously update knowledge and professional skills)[[Digital divide|it.Wikipedia.org "Digital divide"]]).\\nThe social improvement of the masses --resulting from increasing literacy and income, universal means of communication and a new social role of women-- has eroded the traditional role of the elites and have weakened the traditional regulatory role of the state.\\nAs the speed of social and cultural evolution sweeps away old life habits, religious beliefs, ancestral moral convictions and radicated political opinions, the anxiety towards a future that is mutating and unknown causes a cultural opposition that is at the root of fundamentalism. Opposition against new life conditions is justified also by increasing economic inequality: "the gap between the wealth of the North and that of the South of the world has increased by a multiple of five since the beginning of the XX century" ({{in lang|fr}} [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cohen_%28%C3%A9conomiste%29 Daniel Cohen], "Trois leçons sur la société postindustrielle").\\n\\n\\n==Breakdown of natural equilibria==\\nWhen demographic growth is multiplied by the growth of per capita income and consumption, one can have a measure of the global impact on environmental sustainability. Demographic and economic development is endangering our current forms of civilisation and social co-living and our future ability to inhabit our planet.\\nAlternative scenarios developed by international organisations suggest the possibility of a serious breakdown of natural equilibrium unless political, scientific and economic tools are directed to a correction towards an acceptable equilibrium between humankind and with nature.\\n\\n\\n== Related voices==\\n* {{in lang|en}} [[:en:Samir Amin|Samir Amin]]\\n* [[Zygmunt Bauman]]\\n* [[Manuel Castells]]\\n* [[Derrick de Kerckhove]]\\n* [[Anthony Giddens]]\\n* [[Jack Goody]]\\n* [[Ronald Inglehart]]\\n* [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Levy]]\\n* [[Nicholas Negroponte]]\\n* [[Emmanuel Todd]]\\n* [[Immanuel Wallerstein]]\\n* {{in lang|en}} [[:en:Martin Wolf|Martin Wolf]]\\n* [[Postmaterialismo]]\\n* {{in lang|ca}} [http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moviments_socials Moviments socials]\\n\\n==Sources==\\n* World Bank: World Development Indicators Online database [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20398986~menuPK:64133163~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html]\\n* World Bank: Social Indicators of Development 2004\\n* World Bank: Data & Statistics, 2001\\n* World Bank: International Telecommunications Union\\n* Human Development Index\\n* UNO Yearbook 2004\\n* World Value Survey\\n* Eurobarometro\\n* Konjunkturforschungsstelle (KOF): Index of Globalization 2004\\n* International Monetary Fund: World Economic and Financial Survey 2006\\n* UNESCO/OECD: World Education Indicators Programme 1999\\n* United Nations Development Program: Human Development Report 2004\\n* United Nations Population Division: World Population Prospect, 2000\\n\\n==Bibliography (in Italian)==\\n* Krishan Kumar, "Le nuove teorie del mondo contemporaneo" 2000\\n* Martin Wolf, "Perché la globalizzazione funziona" 2006\\n* Ulrich Beck, "Cos'è la globalizzazione" 1999\\n* Peter Sloterdijk, "Breve storia filosofica della globalizzazione" 2002\\n* Peter Sloterdijk, "La morte nel postumanismo" 2004\\n* Peter Sloterdijk, "Non siamo ancora stati salvati" 2001\\n* Jack Goody, "Capitalismo e modernità" 2005\\n* Samir Amin, "Il capitalismo nell'era della globalizzazione" 1997\\n* Zygmunt Bauman, "Dentro la globalizzazione" 2001\\n* Pierre Lévy, "les tecnologies de l'intelligence" 1990\\n* Nicholas Negroponte, "Essere digitali" 1990\\n* Manuel Castells, "Il potere dell'identità" 2003\\n* Manuel Castells, "Galassia internet" 2002\\n* Manuel Castells, "La nascita della società in rete" 2002\\n* Derrick de Kerckhove (a cura di), "Brainframes" 1991\\n* Mark Dery, "Velocità di fuga" 1997\\n* Kevin Robins, "Oltre l'immagine" 1999\\n* Remo Bodei, "Destini personali" 2002\\n* Michel Foucault, "Tecnologie del sè" 1992\\n* Antony Giddens, "La Trasformazione dell'intimità" 1995\\n* Emmanuel Todd, "Dopo l'impero" 2003\\n* Ronald Inglehart, "La società postmoderna" 1998\\n* Daniel Cohen, " Trois leçons sur la société postindustrielle" 2005
'''Academic Art''', a style of painting and sculpture, particularly the style sanctioned by the French Académie des Beaux-Arts in the 19th century. Although the French Academy was then the dominant arbiter of artistic taste, it had influential counterparts in other nations, particularly the Royal Academy in England. The annual exhibitions, or salons, of the national academies featured the work of members and other work selected by a jury. Most salon art reflected the taste of the new bourgeoisie, which was often sentimental and literary, with cultural pretensions.\\n\\nAcademic art was characterized by a respect for classical antiquity, faithful transcription of nature, illusionistic space, minute detail, and eclectic borrowing from the past. It was basically retrogressive, with an emphasis on traditionalism, and usually lacked originality. It was against the canons of academic art that the progressive artists of the 19th century constantly battled, and their reaction against it led to the rise of styles that were diametrically opposed to the academic.\\n\\nThe birth of impressionism in the 1870s brought the dominance of academic art to an end. In the 20th century, when the intense opposition to academic art had diminished, some merits were found in it as a reflection of its time and for its sound technique.
---> Side 7\\n\\nLe Roy Ladurie has also worked on the history of French regions (''Histoire de France des régions'', 2004) and on [[anthropometric history]] as well as on the impact of climate changes on human history. Besides writing books, Le Roy Ladurie is a prolific essayist writing on variety of subjects such as the utility of computers as method of historical research, rates of delinquency in the French Army in the 19th century, the spread of global diseases and the belief of French peasants that magic could be used to generate impotence. The latter was a reference to the widespread practice of French peasant men in the Middle Ages and the early modern period of paying witches to use their (supposed) magical powers to make their rivals in love go impotent. Le Roy Ladurie is also known as one of the first modern [[environmental historian]]s because his work focused on human agency in environmental change, as well as environmental factors in human history.
'''Non-kinetic operations'''\\n\\n"active, as opposed to latent." Dropping bombs and shooting bullets—you know, killing people—is kinetic. But the 21st-century military is exploring less violent and more high-tech means of warfare, such as messing electronically with the enemy's communications equipment or wiping out its bank accounts. These are "non-kinetic."\\n\\n\\nThe kinetic part is easily defined: using the military to kill\\nterrorists “with a global reach,” disrupt their infrastructure,\\nand dissuade those who fund terrorists and their state sponsors upon threat (and occasionally actual visitation) of physical injury.\\n\\nThe nonkinetic parts are often euphemized as the “drain\\nthe swamp” or, better, the “hearts and minds” problem. These\\nnonmilitary aspects focus on terrorism’s motivation and\\nrecruitment patterns, the sociology of terrorist groups that\\nleads them to mobilize, compete, and strike; and the underlying social conditions said to feed that motivation and those\\nrecruitment patterns.\\n\\n\\nGetting at the nonkinetic aspects of the war on terrorism\\ncan be conceived as consisting of immediate, midterm, and\\nlong-term parts. The essence at all stages, however, appears to\\nbe fourfold:\\n#Stigmatize the idea of murdering civilians for any political cause whatsoever, just as slavery, piracy, and human ritual sacrifice were so stigmatized in previous generations.\\n#Identify and stop the flow of money and other resources at all levels from those who approve of terrorism to those who carry it out, redirecting that money and those resources to positive ends, as possible.\\n#Refute, tirelessly and skillfully, the almost endless distortions of U.S. policies and motivations that are promulgated by Islamist propagandists (and others) and that inexorably make Americans and their allies targets of hatred and violence.\\n#Work patiently at social, economic, and political reform (generally in that order) in Muslim-majority countries and among Muslim communities outside the Middle East and South Asia where terrorist cadres are known to have arisen.\\n\\n\\nNonkinetic operations. Training units in non-kinetic operations requires establishing an environment in which human terrain predominates. In such an environment, units can employ nonkinetic resources such as civil affairs (CA) and psychological operations (PSYOP) teams and public affairs officers; and they can conduct leader engagements, disburse money, and participate in reconstruction. to provide the human terrain necessary to train nonkinetic operations, the NTC populates its towns and villages with up to 1,600 role players, of which 250 are Iraqi-Americans who remain in their roles and live in the field for the entire 14-day training event. Each role player is influenced by respective tribal and religious leaders and maintains familial, social, and business relationships throughout the rotation. Some role players have businesses and jobs; others are unemployed and disenfranchised, ripe for insurgent recruitment. Each urban area has its own government structure, police force, businesses, criminal element, and ethnic tension. Provincial government and police forces also exert influence on towns and villages.\\n\\nThe human terrain element makes leaders and soldiers engage with real Iraqis, a function that requires them to adapt to Iraqi culture and seek cooperation. Leaders conduct engagements and negotiate with provincial, town, and tribal leaders to gather information on insurgent activity and to find out who can create jobs, provide medical aid, or develop reconstruction projects. The human element also allows the training unit to employ CA and PSYOP teams throughout its area of operations to influence the role players. Iraqi role players' attitudes change based on unit actions.\\n\\nThe recently constructed Joint coordination center, modeled after facilities in theater, is the focal point of nonkinetic operations. It serves as a coordination center for those acting as coalition forces; Iraqi security forces; local government, tribal and religious leaders; local security and medical personnel; and nongovernmental organization (NGO) workers.\\n\\n\\na Kinetic warfare situation where we are in all out war: dropping bombs, rolling in with tanks, shooting everything that moves. We have since moved on from a Kinetic warfare situation to a Expanded Warfare situation where our primary concerns are to maintain order, repair infrastructure, implement domestic services, and conduct warfare operations against those that wish to disrupt the previous objectives.
'''Coral Reefs'''\\n     Coral reefs are very important ecosystems in our oceans. They are found in tropical areas that have clear, warm water. Coral reefs are formed by polyps that secrete hard calcareous exoskeletons, giving an amazingly firm structure. These colonial “hard corals” form elaborate finger-shaped, branching, or mound shaped structures and can create masses of limestone that stretch for tens or even hundreds of miles. These corals continue to build on top of the skeletal remains of older colonies and eventually a reef is established. Today, richly diverse coral reefs are found in the tropics along coastlines, on the margins of volcanic islands, and as isolated coral atolls. According to a website I found, coral reefs are home to over 25 percent of all marine life and are among the world's most fragile and endangered ecosystems. In the last few decades over 35 million acres of coral reefs have been destroyed and many other reefs have been damaged. One of the major threats to coral reefs is coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which corals lose their distinctive color because they expel the zooxanthellae that live within them. This bleaching is caused by stress to the corals. If a coral is fully bleached, it will turn entirely white, and will die unless the stress on the coral is reduced, allowing the zooxanthellae to return to the coral. The main causes of stress to the coral reefs are the rising water temperatures of the ocean and increased ultraviolet radiation. Two other factors that are believed to be causing stress to the reefs are increased salinity and increased sedimentation. Coral reefs are important, because they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and help regulate atmospheric temperatures, they protect our coastlines from erosion, act as homes to many marine animals, they are used for fishing, provide people with jobs, and of course they play a significant role in tourism.\\n\\nEnvironmental News Network staff.

Physics (Greek: physis – φύσις meaning "nature") is a natural science that involves the study of matter, its motion through spacetime, and all allied components, such as energy and force. This has led to the discovery and understanding of the laws and principles which govern the physical universe. More broadly, Physics is the general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the world and universe behave. One tool which helps with this general analysis is the study of the elementary constituents of the universe and their interactions.\\n\\nPhysics is one of the oldest academic disciplines, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy. Evidence exists that the earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000 BCE, such as the Sumerians, Ancient Egyptians, and the Indus Valley Civilization, all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. Although originally part of other physical sciences and mathematics, Physics emerged to become a unique modern science during the Scientific Revolution of the 16th century.\\n\\nPhysics is both significant and influential, in part because advances in its understanding have often translated into new technologies, but also because new ideas in physics often resonate with other sciences, mathematics, and philosophy. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products which have dramatically transformed modern-day society (e.g., television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons); advances in thermodynamics led to the development of motorized transport; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.\\n\\nPhysics also has philosophical implications. It can be historically traced back to ancient Greek philosophy. From Thales' first attempt to characterize matter, to Democritus' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state, the Ptolemaic astronomy of a crystalline firmament, and Aristotle's book Physics, different Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature. Well into the 18th century, physics was known as "Natural philosophy". By the 19th century physics was realized as a positive science and a distinct discipline separate from philosophy and the other sciences. Physics, as with the rest of science, relies on philosophy of science to give an adequate description of the scientific method.\\n\\n\\nMore about physics\\nedit  \\nSelected article\\nPortrait of Galileo Galilei by Giusto Sustermans\\n\\n    Galileo Galilei was an Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who played a major role in the Scientific Revolution. His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations and support for Copernicanism. Galileo has been called the "father of modern observational astronomy", the "father of modern physics", the "father of science", and "the Father of Modern Science".\\n\\nHis contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter (named the Galilean moons in his honour), and the observation and analysis of sunspots. Galileo also worked in applied science and technology, inventing an improved military compass and other instruments.\\n\\nGalileo's championing of heliocentrism was controversial within his lifetime, when most subscribed to either geocentrism or the Tychonic system.[9] He met with opposition from astronomers, who doubted heliocentrism due to the absence of an observed stellar parallax. The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, and they concluded that it could only be supported as a possibility, not as an established fact. Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point. He was tried by the Inquisition, found "vehemently suspect of heresy", forced to recant, and spent the rest of his life under house arrest. It was while Galileo was under house arrest that he wrote one of his finest works, Two New Sciences. Here he summarized the work he had done some forty years earlier, on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials.\\n\\n    Classical mechanics describes the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, as well as astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, stars, and galaxies. Within these domains, it produces very accurate results. And thus, is one of the oldest and largest subjects in science, engineering and technology. Besides this, many related specialties deal with gases, liquids, and solids, and so on. In addition, classical mechanics is enhanced by special relativity for high velocity objects that are approaching the speed of light. General relativity is employed to handle gravitation at a deeper level, and finally, quantum mechanics handles the wave-particle duality of atoms and molecules.\\n\\nMore selected articles\\nedit  \\nSelected picture\\n\\nThe Hubble Deep Field (HDF) is an image of a small region in the constellation Ursa Major, constructed from a series of observations by the Hubble Space Telescope.

{{Userspace draft|source=ArticleWizard|date=December 2009}}\\n\\n'''KOMAZA''' is a not-for-profit social enterprise working to end rural poverty and unlock economic opportunities for smallholder farmers living in Kenya’s semi-arid climates. \\n\\nFounded in 2006 by Tevis Howard, the organization has developed an innovative grassroots model that generates an unprecedented amount of income for rural families by helping them plant cash crops on previously degraded land. These crops are then harvested, processed and sold to high-value markets.\\n\\nDue to the dry, semi-arid conditions of Coastal Kenya, most people struggle to subsist on poor harvests from drought-prone, infertile land. Because families cannot generate enough money to survive, they have also grown more reliant on the unsustainable use of natural resources, leaving agricultural livelihoods in further peril. This leads to a perpetual cycle of extreme poverty and irreversible deforestation.  \\nIn response to these challenges, KOMAZA has developed intensive microforestry programs, combining microfinance, forestry and family farming.  After identifying interested farmer groups under the advice and consent of community leadership, KOMAZA provides farmers with appropriate farm inputs and tools on credit – such as improved seeds, fertilizer and irrigation technologies.  Then, working through an extension network of more than 50 field staff, KOMAZA offers on-farm training and support as well as complete vertically integrated value capture services so that farmers can access markets and earn a profit.  Farmers can then reinvest this profit to start their own business, pay school fees for their children and receive improved healthcare.  \\n\\nThe organization’s portfolio of crops provides both an immediate and permanent increase in annual income to improve basic life conditions and also yields large lump-sum capital for families to reinvest in major life improvements.  According to KOMAZA, its farm families can earn the equivalent of ten to twenty years’ income over the eight-year lifespan of a half-acre tree farm. KOMAZA has also established two industry-leading experimental farms to research agricultural best-practices for semi-arid farmers. \\n\\nKOMAZA (Swahili for "promote development; encourage growth") is based in Kilifi, Kenya.  As of December 2009, the organization has partnered with nearly 500 farm families, benefiting X.  KOMAZA plans to significantly expand its operations in Kenya to reach 10,000 farmers by the end of 2012.  \\n\\nKOMAZA is registered as a 501(c) 3 charitable organization in the United States and incorporated in the State of California.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n== External links ==\\n* [http://www.example.com/ example.com] \\n\\n\\n<!--- Categories --->

For instance, building a positive community is integral to the workings of an Ecovillage. As these groups are quite small, members need to feel empowered, included and comfortable speaking and sharing ideas. As well, cultural and spiritual practices are encouraged - such an an understanding of the interconnectedness of the earth.\\nEcologically, Ecovillages allow people to be connected to the earth. Members respect their environment as it provides them with the majority of their sustenance. Villages grow the majority of their food organically, use local materials for their buildings, protect biodiversity and growing seasons and protect local water, soil and air. The majority of the practices undertaken by Ecovillages aim to take care of the land. \\nEcovillages demonstrate a unique economic dimension, as money is kept within the community and is circulated between members. Income is often generated through the retail of their products and services and recycled to improve everyone in the community.\\n<ref{{cite web|title=Dimensions of an Ecovillage|url=http://gen.ecovillage.org/ecovillages/4pillarsofsustainability.html|accessdate=March 20 2012}}/ref>\\n\\n\\nWith the increasing evidence of human-initiated climate change, people throughout the world are coming together to try to reduce their carbon-footprint. Groups are trying to move away from the dependence of fossil fuels and consumerist practices. There is a focus on producing and consuming locally, forging meaningful relationships and living as sustainably as possible. Many initiatives are encouraged such as: reducing energy use, creating sustainable local businesses, localizing farming and creating environmentally minded communities.
     Did you know that there is another disastrous event aside from global warming?\\nIt is called global dimming.Global dimming is the gradual reduction in the amount of global hemispherical irradiance (or total solar irradiance) at the Earth's surface, observed since the beginning of systematic measurements in 1950s. The effect varies by location, but worldwide it is of the order of a 5% reduction over the three decades from 1960–1990. This trend has reversed during the past decade. Global dimming creates a cooling effect that may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.\\n\\n     It is currently thought that the effect of global dimming is probably due to the increased presence of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Aerosol particles and other particulate pollutants absorb solar energy and reflect sunlight back into space. The pollutants can also become nuclei for cloud droplets. It is thought that the water droplets in clouds coalesce around the particles. Increased pollution, resulting in more particulates, creates clouds consisting of a greater number of smaller droplets, which in turn makes them more reflective, therefore bouncing more sunlight back into space.\\n\\n     Clouds intercept both heat from the sun and heat radiated from the Earth. Their effects are complex and vary in time, location and altitude. Usually during the daytime the interception of sunlight predominates, giving a cooling effect; however, at night the re-radiation of heat to the Earth slows the Earth's heat loss.\\n\\n     Early reports of "global dimming" attracted little interest, perhaps because the term itself had not yet been coined. The earliest reports seem to be by M. Budyko: "The effect of solar radiation variations on the climate of the Earth" in 1969, published in Tellus. From the late 1980s onwards, scientists independently began working on solar radiation datasets and discovered declining trends worldwide; Atsumo Ohmura Secular variation of global radiation in Europe in 1989; Vivii Russak in 1990 "Trends of solar radiation, cloudiness and atmospheric transparency during recent decades in Estonia", and Beate Liepert in 1994 "Solar radiation in Germany - Observed trends and an assessment of their causes". Gerry Stanhill who studied these declines worldwide in many papers coined the term "dimming". Dimming exists in sites all over the Former Soviet Union.\\n\\n     Independent research in Israel and the Netherlands in the late 1980s showed an apparent reduction in the amount of sunlight, despite widespread evidence that the climate was actually becoming hotter. The rate of dimming varies around the world but is on average estimated at around 2–3% per decade, with the possibility that the trend reversed in the early 1990s. It is difficult to make a precise measurement, due to the difficulty in accurately calibrating the instruments used, and the problem of spatial coverage. Nonetheless, the effect is almost certainly present.\\n\\n     The effect is due to changes within the Earth's atmosphere; the value of the solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere has not changed by more than a fraction of this amount.

The researchers found that those who had experienced WRIST FRACTURES were fifty percent more likely to suffer a disability later on down the road than those who had not suffered a fracture at all. Note that this study did take into effect such things as life styles and demographics into account of the participants studied.\\n\\nWhile the study might not contain some interesting statistics, it does emphasize the need to prevent falls in the home as much as possible. Elderly people, and their caregivers if they have them, need to be very aware of fall risks like steps, thresholds, loose rugs, clutter and anything that could cause a fall.\\n\\nIt's also important for someone who has had a wrist fracture to view the study in the proper light and not be discouraged thinking that it means there's double the chance of becoming disabled. The most likely conclusion to take away is that a person with a broken wrist is more likely to end up with a disability because they fell while others didn't and not because of the broken wrist itself.\\n\\nhttp://www.samiralgazzar.com/article-1313.html
               The spate of recent terrorist attacks on Bombay only goes to evince the fact as to how vulnerable the megalopolis was for such unsuspected assaults that left as many as 180 people dead ,and about 200 wounded in the carnage perpetrated by the assailants.Though the intelligent inputs clearly indicated such possible assaults by the terrorists,no preventive steps were taken either by the Center or by the state government which turned pathetically helpless to defend its citizens, and became susceptible to the vitriolic criticism by the people across the country.A few face- saving measures were initiated to pacify the groundswell of peoples' anger.The change of a home minister or the ousting of a chief minister will not absolve the government of the sins of omission or commission unless a foolproof defensive mechanism is in order.India needs to fortify its intelligence wing, and make it much more accountable.The gross failure to warn the Indian leadership of the possible terrorist attacks only leaves wide gaps in the defence of the country.Every citizen needs to be protected since the constitution guarantees the fundamental right to live ,and the present governement has perforce to answer why it has woefully failed to protect its people.\\n\\nBy Dr Karanamrao
== Nigerian Public Policy ==\\n\\nBy: Hannah Viertel, Taylor Stein, and Karli Lutton\\n\\n\\na. Three facts from today's reading\\n\\n1) The reason most Nigerians live in debt is due to Nigeria’s large dependence on oil revenue. Instead of the people benefiting from the oil revenue, the government officials pocket all of the money, leaving their people in poverty. \\n\\n2) Most Nigerians support federalism; they want any power to be shared and they want to be able to contact their government which would in turn create a true democratic rule. Many southerners point out that federalism can only exist if the central government gives some of its power to state and local governments.\\n\\n3) After international oil prices plummeted in the early 1980's, Nigeria was forced to turn to international organizations for help in managing its huge national debt. In 1985, the Babangida regime developed an economic restructural adjustment program with the support of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The program sought to restructure and diversify the Nigerian economy so that it could decrease its dependence on oil.\\n\\n\\nb. Three assumptions from today's reading\\n\\n1) The government of Nigeria operates under a patron-clientelism system in which the military and political elite operate with only their self interest in mind. State control of resources means that those in the pyramid get the spoils and they alone have access to wealth and influence.\\n\\n2) Southerners protested the practice of revenue sharing because they do not trust the government and therefore no one believed that the profits would benefit anyone except corrupt government officials.\\n\\n3) Northerners generally don't support the true federalism movement with regions controlling their own resources because their regions historically have not had as many resources or as much revenue to share.  Many northern states benefit more than southerners from nationally sponsored redistribution programs.\\n\\n\\nc. Three unanswered questions from today's reading\\n\\n1) Will Nigeria be able to remain together as a nation despite their lack of a coherent national identity?\\n\\n2) Will Nigeria ever be able to diversify its economy and not rely solely on oil?\\n\\n3) Is it possible for Nigeria to change from its system of patron-clientelism to establish a true democracy?

\\n<gallery>\\nImage:Example.jpg|Caption1\\nImage:Example.jpg|Caption2\\n</gallery>\\nSurface geology\\n \\nGlobal view of the surfaceMain article: Geology of Venus\\nMuch of Venus's surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity. Overall, Venus has several times as many volcanoes as Earth, and it possesses some 167 giant volcanoes that are over 100 km across. The only volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii.[20] However, this is not because Venus is more volcanically active than Earth, but because its crust is older. Earth's oceanic crust is continually recycled by subduction at the boundaries of tectonic plates, and has an average age of about 100 million years,[26] while Venus's surface is estimated to be about 500 million years old.[20]\\n\\nSeveral lines of evidence point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. During the Soviet Venera program, the Venera 11 and Venera 12 probes detected a constant stream of lightning, and Venera 12 recorded a powerful clap of thunder soon after it landed. The European Space Agency's Venus Express recorded abundant lightning in the high atmosphere.[27] While rainfall drives thunderstorms on Earth, there is no rainfall on the surface of Venus (though it does rain sulfuric acid in the upper atmosphere that evaporates around 25 km above the surface). One possibility is that ash from a volcanic eruption was generating the lightning. Another piece of evidence comes from measurements of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which were found to drop by a factor of 10 between 1978 and 1986. This may imply that the levels had earlier been boosted by a large volcanic eruption.[28]\\n\\n \\nImpact craters on the surface of Venus (image reconstructed from radar data)There are almost a thousand impact craters on Venus, more or less evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as the Earth and the Moon, craters show a range of states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, while on Earth, it is caused by wind and rain erosion. However, on Venus, about 85% of craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters together with their well-preserved condition indicates that the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago,[12] followed by a decay in volcanism.[29] Earth's crust is in continuous motion, but it is thought that Venus cannot sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100 million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.[20]\\n\\nVenusian craters range from 3 km to 280 km in diameter. There are no craters smaller than 3 km, because of the effects of the dense atmosphere on incoming objects. Objects with less than a certain kinetic energy are slowed down so much by the atmosphere that they do not create an impact crater.[30] Incoming projectiles less than 50 meters in diameter will fragment and burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground.[31]
Hydrogen chloride, also known under the name HCl, is a highly corrosive and toxic colorless gas that forms white fumes on contact with humidity. These fumes consist of hydrochloric acid which forms when hydrogen chloride dissolves in water. Hydrogen chloride gas as well as hydrochloric acid are important chemicals in chemistry, science, technology, and industry. The name HCl often refers somewhat misleadingly to hydrochloric acid instead of the gaseous hydrogen chloride.\\n\\nHydrogen chloride forms corrosive hydrochloric acid on contact with body tissue. Inhalation of the fumes can cause coughing, choking, inflammation of the nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract, and in severe cases, pulmonary edema, circulatory system failure, and death. Skin contact can cause redness, pain, and severe skin burns. Hydrogen chloride may cause severe burns to the eye and permanent eye damage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a telescope in orbit around the Earth, named after astronomer Edwin Hubble for his discovery of galaxies outside the Milky Way and his creation of Hubble's Law, which calculates the rate at which the universe is expanding. Its position outside the Earth's atmosphere allows it to take sharp optical images of very faint objects, and since its launch in 1990, it has become one of the most important instruments in the history of astronomy. It has been responsible for many ground-breaking observations and has helped astronomers achieve a better understanding of many fundamental problems in astrophysics. Hubble's Ultra Deep Field is the deepest (most sensitive) astronomical optical image ever taken.\\nMeanings and types of eugenics\\nThe word eugenics etymologically derives from the Greek word eus (good or well) and the suffix -genēs (born), and was coined by Francis Galton in 1883.\\n\\nEugenics has, from the very beginning, meant many different things to many different people. Historically, the term has referred to everything from prenatal care for mothers to forced sterilization and euthanasia. Much debate took place in the past, and takes place today, as to what exactly counts as eugenics.[3] Some types of eugenics, such as race-based eugenics and class-based eugenics, are sometimes called 'pseudo-eugenics' by proponents of strict eugenics that deals only with beneficial and detrimental intrinsic traits.\\n\\nThe term eugenics is often used to refer to movements and social policies that were influential during the early 20th century. In a historical and broader sense, eugenics can also be a study of "improving human genetic qualities". It is sometimes broadly applied to describe any human action whose goal is to improve the gene pool. Some forms of infanticide in ancient societies, present-day reprogenetics, preemptive abortions and designer babies have been (sometimes controversially) referred to as eugenic.\\n\\nBecause of its normative goals and historical association with scientific racism, as well as the development of the science of genetics, the western scientific community has mostly disassociated itself from the term "eugenics", although one can find advocates of what is now known as liberal eugenics. Ideological social determinists, some of which have obtained college degrees in fields relevant to eugenics, often describe eugenics as a pseudoscience. Modern inquiries into the potential use of genetic engineering have led to an increased invocation of the history of eugenics in discussions of bioethics, most often as a cautionary tale. Some ethicists suggest that even non-coercive eugenics programs would be inherently unethical, though this view has been challenged by such thinkers as Nicholas Agar.[4]\\n\\nEugenicists advocate specific policies that (if successful) would lead to a perceived improvement of the human gene pool. Since defining what improvements are desired or beneficial is perceived by many as a cultural choice rather than a matter that can be determined objectively (e.g., by empirical, scientific inquiry), eugenics has often been deemed a pseudoscience. The most disputed aspect of eugenics has been the definition of "improvement" of the human gene pool, such as what is a beneficial characteristic and what is a defect. This aspect of eugenics has historically been tainted with scientific racism.\\n\\nEarly eugenicists were mostly concerned with perceived intelligence factors that often correlated strongly with social class. Many eugenicists took inspiration from the selective breeding of animals (where purebreds are often strived for) as their analogy for improving human society. The mixing of races (or miscegenation) was usually considered as something to be avoided in the name of racial purity. At the time this concept appeared to have some scientific support, and it remained a contentious issue until the advanced development of genetics led to a scientific consensus that the division of the human species into unequal races is unjustifiable. Some see this as an ideological consensus, since equality, just like inequality, is a cultural choice rather than a matter that can be determined objectively.\\n\\nEugenics has also been concerned with the elimination of hereditary diseases such as haemophilia and Huntington's disease. However, there are several problems with labeling certain factors as "genetic defects":\\n\\nIn many cases there is no scientific consensus on what a "genetic defect" is. It is often argued that this is more a matter of social or individual choice. \\nWhat appears to be a "genetic defect" in one context or environment may not be so in another. This can be the case for genes with a heterozygote advantage, such as sickle cell anemia or Tay-Sachs disease, which in their heterozygote form may offer an advantage against, respectively, malaria and tuberculosis. \\nAlthough some birth defects are uniformly lethal, disabled persons can succeed in life. \\nMany of the conditions early eugenicists identified as inheritable (pellagra is one such example) are currently considered to be at least partially, if not wholly, attributed to environmental conditions. \\nSimilar concerns have been raised when a prenatal diagnosis of a congenital disorder leads to abortion (see also preimplantation genetic diagnosis).\\n\\nEugenic policies have been conceptually divided into two categories: positive eugenics, which encourage a designated "most fit" to reproduce more often; and negative eugenics, which discourage or prevent a designated "less fit" from reproducing. Negative eugenics need not be coercive: a state might offer financial rewards to certain people who submit to sterilization, although some critics might reply that this incentive along with social pressure could be perceived as coercion. Positive eugenics can also be coercive. Abortion by "fit" women was illegal in Nazi Germany, and William Shirer (in The Decline and Fall of the Third Reich) mentioned unsubstantiated reports that Aryan women unwilling to become pregnant were often forced into pregnancy through state-supported rape.\\n\\nDuring the 20th century, many countries enacted various eugenics policies and programs, including:\\n\\nGenetic screening \\nBirth control \\nPromoting differential birth rates \\nMarriage restrictions \\nImmigration control \\nSegregation (both racial segregation as well as segregation of the mentally ill from the normal) \\nCompulsory sterilization \\nForced abortions, or, conversely, forced pregnancies \\nGenocide \\nMost of these policies were later regarded as coercive, restrictive, or genocidal, and now few jurisdictions implement policies that are explicitly labeled as eugenic or unequivocally eugenic in substance (however labeled). However, some private organizations assist people in genetic counseling, and reprogenetics may be considered as a form of non-state-enforced "liberal" eugenics.\\n\\nThere are 3 main ways by which the methods of eugenics can be applied. They are:\\n\\nmandatory eugenics, in which the government mandates a eugenics program. \\npromotional voluntary eugenics, in which eugenics is voluntarily practiced and promoted to the general population, but not officially mandated. \\nprivate eugenics, which is practiced voluntarily by individuals and groups, but not promoted to the general population. \\nThere are also different goals of eugenics.[5] They are:\\n\\nintrinsic eugenics, which seeks to exclusively improve a person's genetic traits that are intrinsically beneficial or detrimental to them, such as physical health, mental health, attractiveness, reproductive ability, physical aptitude, intelligence, and self-control \\nracial eugenics, which emphasizes selectively breeding a specific race or races \\nextrinsic social eugenics, which selectively breeds people that have high social status and the genetic traits thereof, such as wealth, attendance at popular colleges, college degrees, popularity, extroversion, personality, and humour
Article Proposal\\n\\nI propose to create an article on “Social Determinants of Health in Poverty” for several reasons: \\n\\n1.	There exists a problem: Within the United States, and across the globe, there exists massive differentials in health outcomes between disadvantaged individuals and the rest of the population, and these health outcomes can be determined based on social factors specific to impoverished populations. Research supports that there exists these differentials. \\n2.	Its importance: Differences in health attributable to different factors such as health care, access to the social safety net, and access to nutritional foods can ensnare the impoverished in the cycle of poverty, disadvantaging many people in society. Poverty traps easily arise from the condition of poor health as people cannot provide themselves with proper care to properly treat their illness, disadvantaging their lives and society. Health is a basic human right that ensures a life where individuals can maximize their capabilities, and understanding the causes of the differences between health will help create policies that solve the underlying causes. Such importance will be reduced to clearly cited factual information within the Wikipedia article itself, with nearly all of this material stated and cited. \\n3.	Lack of awareness: Very few people realize how devastatingly enormous differentials in health care and health outcomes are between privileged and disadvantaged populations, across the globe and within one population. The general public does not recognize the immense ramifications of prevalent injustices in healthcare and social safety nets within one country, and comparatively between different regions of the world. Readers should recognize the social determinants of health within impoverished populations that have different dynamics than the rest of the population. \\n4.	Providing solutions: Health, health care, and access to these provisions represents one of the most prominent debates currently, and has been of vital importance over the past decades to the United States, governments across the globe, and non-profit organizations seeking to understand and improve the health of people. Understanding health, health differentials, differences in these outcomes, as well as access to health care and obstacles embedded in society provides an educated view that builds the foundation for making policy decisions that influence the health and well-being of our nation.\\n\\nI opt to create a new page rather than edit the existing page [[social determinants of health]] for the following reasons: \\n\\n1.	That article has many tags for subpar content, including having multiple issues, being written like a personal reflection or essay rather than an encyclopedic description of the subject, disputed neutrality, a slanted tone, and the perspective provided deals primarily with Canada and does not represent a world view.\\n2.	This article does not provide a specific approach to how poverty, low income, or low socioeconomic status greatly affects the health of people, and how even with those in poverty there is great disparity between health outcomes. Neglect of this fact provides readers with a limited scope of just how divisively health care disparities cut society, even within similar income classes within a country and across the world. \\n3.	Finally, structural causes inherent in society are not clearly represented, and need to be to provide a clear picture to the public of how structural institutions and policy provide these health differentials between different groups of people, even within the lives of the impoverished. \\n\\nIntroduction: \\n\\nThis article will focus on social determinants of health outcomes in impoverished communities by focusing on the disparities in health and causes of such attributable to gender, socioeconomic status, geographical location, society, developed nation status, and underlying societal causes. I will explain all the statistics of gender differences in health and then address underlying causes including a structural violence aspect of gender differences. Structural violence will be one of many academic paradigms that explains the underlying causes of social characteristics determining health outcomes. Health inequalities among economically disadvantaged people, which have be attributed to poor healthcare, lack of nutrition, lack of resources to maintain healthcare, and the influence of neighborhood, location, education, and other factors on health outcomes. Social determinants discuss not only discrimination but also the fundamental causes of health differentials.  \\n\\nI propose the following preliminary outline: \\nSocial determinants of health in poverty\\n\\na.

Unlike other forms of lending, borrowers in this sector tend to be of low income and are often on social benefits. Repayments tend to be on a weekly basis and are collected by an agent. The rate of interest offered by providers of credit in this sector is high, often at £40 or £50 per £100 meaning that operators in this sector often face controversy.\\n\\n'''History'''\\nHome Credit has been around since the nineteenth century - but in a form much different to today. The current form of Home Credit predominantly involves cash loans, whereas in past times drapery and home products were the norm.\\n\\n'''Companies who Provide Home Credit'''\\nThe biggest provider of Home Credit in the UK is [[Provident Financial]] which has over 50% of the market providing credit to 2.4 million customers. The biggest four companies have a 70% market share.
The Indian telecom sector has been growing at an exponential rate – being one of the fastest growing sectors in recent times with over 494.07 million subscribers according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). Wireless telephony is definitely the in thing. Even despite the slowdown 11 to 13 million new subscribers are added every month. And this explosive growth of the sector is matched only by the cutthroat competition among the players. As an industry insider revealed, “This is a high stakes game – one in which no one is willing to become the sucker, and it explains the rampant corruption in it. If any one party loses, it perversely seeks to drag its rivals into the quagmire also.” It is more or less the same story in sectors like defense and mining, which too have high stakes and high returns.\\n\\nBut one thing that is special to the telecom sector is that it is not just growing in size but in its scope as well. Earlier we had just GSM-based services; now there is CDMA too. And to these will shortly be added 3G and WiMax, followed by Long Term Evolution (LTE). None of these can enter till the government gives its nod, and without State involvement and intervention at practically every stage.
== North American Carbon Exchange ==\\n\\nThe [http://www.NoCarbEx.com North American Carbon Exchange NoCarbEx.com] is a voluntary "[[carbon_credit]]" exchange.  NoCarbEx purchases carbon credits from individuals and businesses planting trees to reduce greenhouse gases.  The Exchange bundles the shares of carbon credits and resells them to help businesses offset their carbon footprint. \\n\\n=== Lowering Greenhouse Gases ===\\nRising world levels of CO2 ([[Greenhouse effect]]) from fossil fuel emissions is a major cause of global warming. It is widely accepted that global temperature is increasing because world levels of CO2 are rising. The majority of the CO2 is produced by human activity, specifically by the burning of fossil fuels in power plants, automobiles, and deforestation.\\n\\nLowering these CO2 levels is being addressed by two major approaches. Non-fossil fuel approaches include nuclear, wind, and solar. Removing CO2 from the atmosphere is possible by planting trees. Wood, almost half carbon, provides one of the most commercially viable approaches for sequestering massive amounts of carbon dioxide. The world marketplace has existed since 2004 for carbon sequestration.  The largest US marketplace for voluntary carbon credits is the [[Chicago_Climate_Exchange]].\\n\\n=== Individual Participation in Carbon Credit Trading ===\\nThe North American Carbon Exchange allows individuals to participate in the voluntary carbon markets by providing financial incentives for [[afforestation]]. The Exchange has its own methodology to measure and transparently verify that all carbon dioxide offsets are additional and permanent. The NoCarbEx methodology fully complies or exceeds the principles of all major global warming regulatory regimes (i.e., the [[Kyoto_treaty]], the California Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and most of the draft US Federal Legislation). These principles are:\\n\\nAdditionality. From the perspective of global warming, offsets need to be additional and result in a net decrease of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In other words, the sequestration of greenhouse gases needs to happen in addition to what would happen in the absence of the intervention. \\n\\nLeakage. It is important to ensure that the additional carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere is not emitted elsewhere as a result of the planting of new trees. \\n\\nPermanence. The carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by growing trees needs to become "permanently" sequestered. NoCarbEx participants commit to keep the trees planted for a minimum of 40 years and pay a penalty if the tree is removed before this time. \\n\\nVerification. Every single tree registered with NoCarbEx has a technical data-sheet that is maintained by NoCarbEx showing the type of tree and its expected growth and carbon sequestration potential. All NoCarbEx trees are geo-referenced and can be found easily through Google or other mapping software.\\n\\n==Copyright problems==\\n[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|left|48px|]]Hello.

Globalisation is a term which developed momentum during the 1970's as world relationships increased with the establishment of several organisations, aimed at developing global unity through international trade, the spreading of multiculturalism and the widespread diffusion of technology. Due to the fact that there are many sub-divisions of globalisation, a standard and generally accepted definition has not yet been created as different sectors view globalisation according to their specialty. According to Horst Kohler, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), globalisation is the "process of increasing international divisions of labour and the accompanying integration of national economies through trade in goods and services, cross border cooperate investments and financial flows". However it is also the integration of world culture and society through the "proliferation of communication and information." Increased world relationships, usually controlled by Core Countries, can impact both positively and negatively on developing countries such as the Caribbean where dependant development is practiced.\\n\\nThe process of globalisation can be traced back to the voyages of the Spanish, Dutch and Portugeese during "European maritime and mercantile expansion" in the early 16th century where these explorers traded with overseas nations and developed navigational technologies in an effort to expand trading relationships. Even the Africans and Nordics traded with indigenous North American peoples long before the arrival of the Europeans in the New World, and exercised some degree of cultural influence on the American's way of life, where habits were adopted and languages fused to establish a plane of understanding. The first hints of globalisation for the Caribbean could have begun with colonization where different people of different nationalities and culture were under the same umbrella of society, resulting in increased trade and communications between the Metropolis and the colonies, as well as the start of cultural hegemony which can be considered a negative impact of globalisation.\\n\\nAfter World War 2 with the establishment of the UN, world organisations were formed such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) who assumed its role as the "directing and coordinating authority of international health work" where they aim to attain the "highest possible level of health". Due to the fact that Caribbean countries lack the financial resources to develop their health sector, the WHO assists these countries financially as well as offer external assistance by "training the countries' human resources and strengthening other institutions" so that they will possess the scientific and technical knowledge to combat common disease within the region.\\n\\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) an agency of the U.N. developed as a result of globalisation, also seeks to facilitate the needs of the Caribbean Countries through providing financial assistance to both the public and private sector to develop their economies and achieve a favourable balance of payments. They support the establishment of organisations such as the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC) where they contribute financially to the provision of technical and tax training as well as financial supervisions and public expenditure management for Caribbean countries in need.\\n\\nSince the 1970's onwards, the Caribbean has experienced lower levels of mortality rates through better technologies in the health sector made available by world organisations established as a result of globalisation. Adult Literacy has increased by almost 10% in the Caribbean due to the fact that one of the concepts of globalisation is free trade and a reduction on trade tariffs which enables Caribbean communities to access proper reading materials as well as offer citizens a greater opportunity to be educated outside the Caribbean by promoting international student policies and scholarships. Due to the fact that Globalisation constructs free trade zones, Caribbean islands are able to import goods with reduced import restrictions and custom duties as well as allow the influx of multi national firms which would lead to a greater variety of goods and services, stimulating economic growth and devolopment by an increased national income, GDP as well as increased levels of employment.\\n\\nHowever despite all its attractive advantages, globalisation can be considered the reason for the existence of "poor countries" such as Africa where the slave trade and the "scramble" for Africa in the 1870's (early signs of globalisation) underdeveloped the once prosperous nation, acording to Walter Rodney. Increased social relationships among "distant localities" and neo-liberal policies result in the exploitation of the resources of the Lesser Economically Devoloped Countries (LEDC) as the developed countries practice a form of neocolonisation where they acquire "inexpensive natural resouces from poorer countries" including oil, which contributes to their dependency on the Metropolitan countries, while not raising their standard of living. The US consumes 80% of the world's resources and obtains 40% from other countries such as Latin American and the Caribbean as well as mediterranean nations.\\n\\nGlobalisation also result in cultural and political imperialism. Through increased interaction among nations, governments are able to exercise vasts amounts of political power through "military might and economic influence". Trade and economic connections with foreigh countries have had an adverse effect on the Caribbean since our relationship with the US has heightened their interest in political affairs, where they have taken up the opportunity to intervene whenever their "humanitarian and political interests were being threatened" as with Cuba 1959 and Grenada 1983. Trade has also led to cultural imports of foreign food, music, language and other aspects of European/American way of life which pressure local culture. Due to the fact that Latin America and the Caribbean account for 10% of international television viewing, this constant input of foreign taste threaten unique Caribbean identity through the adoption of traditions, norms and values of Core Countries leading to deculturalisation and conflict with identity which may cause cultural erasure.\\n\\nGlobalisation has many positive effects stemming from increased trade and technologies to global organisations which assist the Caribbean financially in order to develop their economies. However according to Norman Girman, this leads to financial dependency for "government capital" through a one-way preferential trading relationship with Core Countries. It promotes political and cultural hegemony leading to a loss of identity, customs and unique societal traits. Globalisation stimulates the tourism industry of the Caribbean through increased awarness and international visibility via the mass media, however this results in the exploitation of our natural resources such as the coral reefs and beaches as well as the involvement of foreigners in the industry where they establish hotel and businesses, thus returning capital to countris such as Germany, USA and England. Hence the question is globalisation really beneficial to Caribbean communities or is the concept really just in the interest of developed nations?[[User:Krissiebaby1987|Krissiebaby1987]] 23:49, 17 September 2007 (UTC)
The advent of "hybrid showering" systems is rather new. Powerful consumption made possible by a highly automated destruction of vast quantities of hydrocarbons from the Earth, have in a sense over a short time developed a "blind spot" that camouflages the heinous waste of thermal energy, water, and consumables like soap that the contemporary but still extremely primitive bathroom shower system requires to operate.\\n\\n\\nThe practical laws that govern "extreme waste" in contemporary showers was first discovered by Michael Vittorio Collalto who in the period during 1986 and particularly from 1994 onwards set about materializing what has become this worlds first "hybrid shower", that is one of many hybrid showering configurations possible..\\n\\n\\nIt gradually incorporated a research facility, used to test the hypothesis amongst others that the shower seemed to be no better than an efficient "cooling tower", amazingly adverse to the aim of providing a warm or hot environment.\\n\\n\\n(used to cool water in order to improve the efficiency of the refrigeration cycle in larger applications. e.g. commercial buildings.)--[[User:Hybrid Shower|Hybrid Shower]] 09:11, 18 April 2007 (UTC)\\n[[Shower science]]
Over the past 35 years or so, phosphite has been widely used to improve the yield of many crops throughout world. Phosphite’s use is controversial as it is being widely marketed both as a crop fungicide and as a superior source of crop phosphorus nutrition (i.e. P fertilizer). At least 10 different agrochemical companies in Europe and North America appear to have avoided the substantial cost and time associated with registering a fungicide by labeling their phosphite product as a P-fertilizer. It is well established that fungicides based on phosphite are an effective control agent for crop pathogens belonging to the order Oomycetes (esp. Phytophthora sp). However, no evidence exists that plants can use phosphite as their sole source of nutritional P. Although plants readily absorb and translocate phosphite, it is quite stable in planta and is not readily metabolized. Phosphite rapidly kills phosphate-starved plants as it represses plant genes that are specifically induced during phosphate starvation (to help plants survive phosphate deprivation), as well as plant morphological responses to Pi stress (such as an increased root:shoot growth ratio). This research seriously compromises the credibility of the many companies that market phosphite as a ‘super P-fertilizer’rather than as a fungicide.\\n\\nAll of this is summarized in a recent review article about phophite that was written by Thao & Yamakawa (2008) and published in Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, vol 55: pp. 228-234

It's easy for people to have communication issues on the internet, from getting hurt feelings from nothing and rising tensions to becoming trolls. This, I believe, is partly because the medium robs some of our humanity from us. In real life, people don't have miscommunication as frequently as online because our species, barring those with certain brain disorders, has a lot of instinctual emotion tied into being in the physical presence of each other. In the flesh, when we see people suffer, we have an emotional response, and when we talk, we get a rich context of nonverbal communication in tone, facial expression, eye movements, and even scent. Online, we're almost flying blind, and so it's easy to run into problems. Wikipedia, like any other online community, suffers from this problem. There is no solution to this, one just needs to keep this in mind and take extra care to be civil, not to say things that can easily be misunderstood, and to be careful in interpreting what other people say, asking for clarification when necessary. --[[User:Improv|Improv]] 05:28, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

This climate generally features warm, but not hot summers and cool, but not cold winters, with a narrow annual temperature range. It typically lacks a dry season, as precipitation is more evenly dispersed through the year. It is the predominant climate type across much of Europe, coastal northwestern North America, portions of southern South America and small areas of Africa, southeast Australia, New Zealand, as well as isolated locations elsewhere.\\n\\n\\n\\ndistruction:\\nThe most extreme change in Earth surface conditions during the Cenozoic Era began just after the temporal boundary between the Paleocene and Eocene epochs approximately 55.0 million years ago. This event, the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, alternatively "Eocene thermal maximum 1" (ETM1), and formerly known as the "Initial Eocene" or "Late Paleocene Thermal Maximum",[1] (IETM/LPTM)), was associated with rapid (in geological terms) global warming, profound changes in ecosystems, and major perturbations in the carbon cycle.\\nGlobal temperatures rose by about 6 °C (11 °F) over a period of approximately 20,000 years. That is a 0.0003 °C (.00055 °F) increase per year. Many benthic foraminifera and terrestrial mammals went extinct, but numerous modern mammalian orders emerged. The event is linked to a prominent negative excursion in carbon stable isotope (δ13C) records from across the globe, and dissolution of carbonate deposited on all ocean basins. The latter observations strongly suggest that a massive input of 13C-depleted carbon entered the hydrosphere or atmosphere at the start of the PETM. Recently, geoscientists have begun to investigate the PETM in order to better understand the fate and transport of increasing greenhouse-gas emissions over millennial time scales.\\n\\nEndangered plants and animals:\\nEndangered marine species in the Arctic Ocean include walruses and whales.[12] The area has a fragile ecosystem which is slow to change and slow to recover from disruptions or damage.[12] Lion's mane jellyfish are abundant in the waters of the Arctic, and the banded gunnel is the only species of gunnel that lives in the ocean.\\nThe Arctic Ocean has relatively little plant life except for phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are a crucial part of the ocean and there are massive amounts of them in the Arctic, where they feed on nutrients from rivers and the currents of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.[26] During summer, the Sun is out day and night, thus enabling the phytoplankton to photosynthesize for long periods of time and reproduce quickly. However, the reverse is true in winter where they struggle to get enough light to survive.[26]\\n\\nHelp Them:\\nThe provision of the law in Section 4 that establishes critical habitat is a regulatory link between habitat protection and recovery goals, requiring the identification and protection of all lands, water and air necessary to recover endangered species.[29] To determine what exactly is critical habitat, the needs of open space for individual and population growth, food, water, light or other nutritional requirements, breeding sites, seed germination and dispersal needs, and lack of disturbances are considered.[30]\\nAs habitat loss is the primary threat to most imperiled species, the Endangered Species Act of 1973 allowed the Fish and Wildlife Service(FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service(NMFS) to designate specific areas as protected "critical habitat" zones. In 1978, Congress amended the law to make critical habitat designation a mandatory requirement for all threatened and endangered species.\\nThe amendment also added economics into the process of determining habitat: "...shall designate critical habitat...on the basis of the best scientific data available and after taking into consideration the economic impact, and any other impact, of specifying...area as critical habitat." [31] The congressional report on the 1978 amendment described the conflict between the new Section 4 additions and the rest of the law.\\n\\nplants and animals: \\nMarine animals are divided into three groups: zooplankton, nekton, and benthos. Zooplankton are drifting animals and are usually small, however, they can grow to fairly large size. For example, the jellyfish and the Portuguese man-of-war are examples of larger types of zooplankton which are unable to propel themselves effectively and are therefore at the mercy of either wind or current. The zooplankton population also includes some temporary members such as fish eggs or larval forms of organisms which may grow up and leave the planktonic community to join the nekton or benthos.\\n\\nNekton are the free swimmers and probably the largest portion of familiar animals found in the ocean belong to this class. Common fishes, the octopus, whales, eels and squid are all examples of nekton. The nekton category includes a number of very diverse creatures. The whale, dolphin and porpoise are certainly very different from codfish or trout because whales represent sea mammals whereas cod.\\n\\nOcean Shores is a city in Grays Harbor County, Washington, United States.

Long before the arrival of European explorers and settlers, the peninsula was used by the various local tribes for trading and other purposes. The Chinook, Chehalis, and Quinault Tribes used the area, as well as others that now make up the Quinault Indian Nation.\\nOn May 7, 1792 Captain Robert Gray sailed into the bay and named the area Bullfinch Harbor. Later, Captain George Vancouver re-named the area after Captain Gray, now called Gray's Harbor. The first white established settler on the Point was Matthew McGee, who settled in the early 1860s. He sold the southern portion of the peninsula to A.O. Damon in 1878 for a trading supply center whose dock extended into the Oyehut channel. A.O. Damon took over the entire peninsula from McGee with the land passed along to his grandson, Ralph Minard, who used the area as a cattle ranch from 1929 until he sold to the Ocean Shores Development Corporation in 1960 for $1,000,000.\\nAt the time the Washington State legislature was considering legalizing some forms of gambling. In expectation of a huge casino development, the Ocean Shores Development Corporation opened their sale of lots in a travel trailer parked in the dunes. Soon the word spread about the California-style development of the place called Ocean Shores. The price of lots began at $595 and were sold sight unseen from the first plat maps. As the numbers of lots sold rose, the prices rose. Property lots were staked and numbered only as the road construction crews began to lay out the massive road system. Even though the first roads were only 20 miles (32 km) in length, the downtown area had mercury vapor lights to show that this was a booming city. In the first year 25 homes were constructed and their owners had charter membership certificates in the Ocean Shores Community Club.\\nAs the development grew, the Ginny Simms Restaurant and Nightclub brought in the Hollywood set. In fact, on Grand Opening night chartered planes flew up a whole contingent of Hollywood stars, and 11,000 people turned out at Bowerman Basin to see the celebrities.\\nBy December, 1960, 25 miles (40 km) of canals were planned, a six-hole golf course was drawing players, and the mall shopping area was ready for the 1961 Ocean Shores Estates construction boom. The mall, 100 motel units, three restaurants and the airstrip sprang up from the sandy ground with the marina opening in 1963. The S.S. Catala was brought up from California to become a "boatel" and charter fleet office. Two years later a southwest winter storm drove her into the sand and for many years she was the most famous shipwreck on the Washington Coast. In 1966 the famous gates to the city were installed.\\nPat Boone became a local resident in 1967 as a stockholder in the Ocean Shores Estates Incorporated and promotion of the development was sped along by the famous Celebrity Golf tournaments hosted by Boone.\\nBy 1969 Ocean Shores was declared the "Richest Little City" with an assessed evaluation of $35 million and 900 permanent residents. The following year the city was incorporated with a planning commission formed to zone the city and codify streets. The city's first school opened in 1971 and road paving on streets began in earnest.\\nDuring the 1970s, the town struggled through many setbacks brought on mainly by the state's economic recession. By the 1980s, the slump was over and construction of homes and businesses increased.\\n[edit]Geography\\n\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 12.1 square miles (31 km2) of which 8.6 square miles (22 km2) of it is land and 3.4 square miles (8.8 km2) or 28.50% of it is water.\\n[edit]Climate\\nOcean Shores experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb).\\n[hide]Climate data for Ocean Shores, Washington\\nMonth	Jan	Feb	Mar	Apr	May	Jun	Jul	Aug	Sep	Oct	Nov	Dec	Year\\nRecord high °F (°C)	68\\n(20)	76\\n(24)	76\\n(24)	85\\n(29)	93\\n(34)	94\\n(34)	96\\n(36)	94\\n(34)	92\\n(33)	85\\n(29)	69\\n(21)	64\\n(18)	96\\n(36)\\nAverage high °F (°C)	49\\n(9)	51\\n(11)	54\\n(12)	56\\n(13)	60\\n(16)	63\\n(17)	66\\n(19)	67\\n(19)	67\\n(19)	60\\n(16)	53\\n(12)	48\\n(9)	57.8\\n(14.4)\\nAverage low °F (°C)	38\\n(3)	37\\n(3)	39\\n(4)	41\\n(5)	46\\n(8)	49\\n(9)	52\\n(11)	52\\n(11)	49\\n(9)	44\\n(7)	40\\n(4)	36\\n(2)	43.6\\n(6.4)\\nRecord low °F (°C)	11\\n(−12)	9\\n(−13)	22\\n(−6)	26\\n(−3)	27\\n(−3)	33\\n(1)	32\\n(0)	35\\n(2)	30\\n(−1)	24\\n(−4)	12\\n(−11)	7\\n(−14)	7\\n(−14)\\nPrecipitation inches (mm)	11.10\\n(281.9)	8.18\\n(207.8)	8.08\\n(205.2)	5.73\\n(145.5)	3.60\\n(91.4)	2.57\\n(65.3)	1.36\\n(34.5)	1.64\\n(41.7)	2.57\\n(65.3)	7.56\\n(192)	12.09\\n(307.1)	10.79\\n(274.1)	75.27\\n(1,911.9)\\nSource: [3]\\n[edit]Demographics\\n\\nHistorical populations\\nCensus	Pop.		%±\\n1970	800		\\n—\\n1980	1,777		122.1%\\n1990	2,301		29.5%\\n2000	3,836		66.7%\\n2010	5,569		45.2%\\nAs of the census[1] of 2000, there were 3,836 people, 1,789 households, and 1,198 families residing in the city.

Particle size analysis, particle size measurement, or simply particle sizing is the collective name of the technical procedures, or laboratory techniques which determines the size range, and/or the average, or mean size of the particles in a powder sample.\\n\\nParticle size analysis is part of Particle Science, and its determination is carried out generally in particle technology laboratories.\\n\\nThe particle size can have considerable importance in a number of industries including the chemical, mining, forestry, agriculture, and aggregate industries.\\n\\n* When one of the reactants is a powder, or when in a chemical reaction the catalyst is in a pulverised state, either in a fixed bed, or in a fluidised reactor.\\n\\nThe Particle Technology Forum, an international and interdisciplinary forum, but also a division of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers says: «…particle technology — that branch of science and engineering dealing with the production, handling, modification, and use of a wide variety of particulate materials, both wet or dry, in sizes ranging from nanometers to centimeters… spans a range of industries to include chemical, petrochemical, agricultural, food, pharmaceuticals, mineral processing, advanced materials, energy, and the environment»\\n\\nThere are a large number of methods for the determination of particle size, and it is important to state at the outset, that these different methods are not expected to give identical resülts: the size of a powder depends on the method used for its measurement, and it is important to choose that method for its determination which is relevant to its use.\\n\\nThe size of materials being processed in an operation is very important. Having oversize material being conveyed will cause damage to equipment and slow down production. Particle-size analysis also helps the effectiveness of SAG Mills when crushing material.\\n\\nParticle-size analysis in the agriculture industry is paramount because unwanted materials will contaminate products if they are not detected. By having an automated particle size analyzer, companies can closely monitor their processes.\\n\\n: [http://www.analysis-technology.com Analyzer]
Hi all.  Comments and discussion about psychotherapy are welcome, particularly around ISTDP ([[Intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy]]).\\n\\nBrief biographical blurb:  I'm finishing up my psychiatry residency in Halifax (Canada) and will be relocating to Vancouver with my fiancée next spring to begin work.  My key area of interest is in the use of psychotherapy with individuals suffering from medically unexplained symptoms.  \\n\\nI have found that, clinically, a frequent cause of unexplained symptoms is autonomic dysregulation of emotions.  In plain language, people get quite anxious about experiencing certain emotions, often because those emotions are thought to be too threatening or overwhelming.  Instead, the emotion is anxiously blocked off from being experienced.  Some of the ways emotions get blocked off get translated into symptoms.  One common example would be a headache at work in the context of a very frustrating situation.\\n\\nThe good news is, with a brief course of psychotherapy, previously feared emotions can be directly experienced, and people who previously had a very poor quality of life can have dramatic improvement.\\n\\n--[[User:Robert Tarzwell|Robert Tarzwell]] 14:24, 27 November 2005 (UTC)
== '''Diabetes Treatment''' ==\\n\\n\\nDiabetes is a quite common and well-known condition. Are you experiencing any of the following: fatigue, thirst, weight loss, blurred vision or frequent urination? These are some symptoms of Diabetes, though some sufferers of this disease show no symptoms. Diabetes can be diagnosed by a blood test. This natural treatment formula includes ingredients that can optimize blood sugar control and may improve the overall health condition. Essential natural ingredients are included in tthis natural treatment of diabetes; for example, chromium which helps to regulate blood sugar level and indirectly affects level of fats in the blood, and taurine may improve insulin sensitivity and decrease cholesterol level.\\n\\n'''Main Functions:'''\\n\\nDiabetes is a disorder characterized by abnormally high blood glucose levels. People with diabetes cannot properly process glucose, a sugar the body uses for energy. As a result, glucose tends to move inefficiently from the bloodstream to the tissues of the body where it is needed. Therefore, at the same time that blood glucose levels are elevated, the rest of the body can be starved for glucose. Chromium helps to regulate blood sugar level and indirectly affects level of fats in the blood. Alpha-Lipoic Acid may relieve symptoms of nerve damage in people with diabetes and may improve the glucose-lowering action of insulin.\\n\\nDiabetes can lead to poor wound healing, higher risk of infections, and damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart. Zinc is an essential mineral that is a component of enzymes needed to repair wounds, maintain fertility in adults, help cells reproduce, preserve vision, boost immunity, and protect against free radicals, among other functions. Antioxidants, including Vitamin C, Vitamin E and phytonutrients in Bilberry, prevent damage to the nerves, eyes, and heart.\\n\\n'''Ingredients Description:'''\\n\\nChromium helps to regulate blood sugar levels and indirectly affects the level of fats in the blood. Alpha-Lipoic Acid may relieve symptoms of nerve damage in people with diabetes and may improve the glucose-lowering action of insulin. Vitamin B Complex helps produce enzymes that convert glucose to energy and may also aid in preventing diabetic nerve damage. Flaxseed contains essential fatty acids that protect against nerve damage and keep the blood supply of the arteries consistent. Flaxseed also works to lower cholesterol, thereby protecting against heart disease. Antioxidants, including Vitamin C, Vitamin E and phytonutrients in Bilberry, prevent damage to the nerves, eyes, and heart. Gymnema may increase insulin production or increase insulin release. Taurine may improve insulin sensitivity and decrease cholesterol level. Zinc is an essential mineral that is a component of enzymes needed to repair wounds, maintain fertility in adults, help cells reproduce, preserve vision, boost immunity, and protect against free radicals, among other functions. Copper is needed with long-term use of zinc, because zinc inhibits copper absorption.\\n\\n'''Supplement Facts'''\\n\\nNatural Diabetes Alternative Remedies\\n\\n{| class="wikitable" border="1"\\n|-\\n!

== Practical Treatments for Generalized Anxiety Disorder ==\\n\\n\\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder is a recognized and common condition. With the levels of stress that most of us face every day, it is no wonder that this disorder could easily develop. It is good to know that it is a medical condition that can be practically treated with medications and/ or psychotherapy. The primary symptoms associated with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) are tension, inability to relax and persistent worrying over matters that don't call for any extreme concern. Any person with GAD will find it difficult to control the symptoms. It is as if there is a roller coaster of anxiety running through the mind at all times and it will not stop unless the person experiencing these symptoms can find quiet isolation. Other symptoms that accompany this disorder are difficulty concentration, being easily startled, chronic irritability which could lead to drug seeking behavior, general restlessness and insomnia (Hoffman SG, 2008).\\n\\nThe most practical approach to treating GAD is a combination of cognitive therapy and medication. Cognitive therapy is a way or re-training the brain to react to certain stimuli in a healthy manner. For example, if the sound of a dog barking induces a panic attack, the therapist would work with someone to discover what triggers this reaction. These triggers set off a chemical cascade in the brain that induces anxiety. By discovering the thoughts that cause the anxious reaction, the cognitive therapist is then able to help re-route the thinking process to eliminate the sensation of anxiety and panic. Often, by the time a person has reached the doctor's office for this problem, it is necessary to use medication to alleviate the symptoms and protect the body from the dangers of chronic stress.\\n\\nCurrently, the primary pharmacological treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder is a class of drugs called SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake inhibitors). These medications have been proven to be the best treatment for GAD. They increase the levels of a neurotransmitter (a chemical that facilitates a specific electrical impulse in the brain) called serotonin. When there is enough serotonin in our brains, we feel content, confident, trusting and safe. When serotonin is deficient, we feel scared, worried, shy and insecure (Pollack MH, 2008 ). SSRIs have been proven effective in countless studies. These include medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft) and citalopram (Celexa), among many others. When someone has remained on one of these medications for 6-8 months, they may be taken off of the medication to determine if it is still needed. The only drawback to SSRIs is the time it takes for them to demonstrate any benefit. This could take 4-6weeks before any results are perceived.\\n\\nIn the interim, drugs known as benzodiazepines are prescribed for short-term relief until the SSRI begins to work and the cognitive therapy starts to show results. These drugs are immediately effective within less than an hour. Alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan) and oxazepam (Serax) are some of the commonly prescribed benzodiazepines. These are the most effective medications for anxiety disorders, but they are highly addictive, so doctors usually prescribe a small amount until other treatments begin to help.\\n\\nAll of this is good news. Psychiatrists around the world have a plan to treat GAD. You don't have to live with this problem or be afraid of treatments.\\n\\nHoffman SG, S. J. (2008).

{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\nThe modern business world is very competitive and always looks for methods to gain profit.  Most profitable companies are those that give customers what they require. Satisfied customers are faithful to those suppliers they feel best understand their requirements. Accordingly they will do again purchases and will recommend the company to their friends. There are two main types of customers for a business. One customer is end customers. They are like looking to purchase an iPod or plasma screen television. Other one is an Organizational customer. For example, a company recording audio CDs would buy in blank CDs, record music to them and sell them on as a finished product. Businesses therefore benefit from working with BSI to meet standards because, standards for project consumers’ fundamental right to safety, the right to be informed and the right to choose. These rights relate to products, services, process and materials, Standardization promote effective research and development, and makes products easier to use and standardization relies on all sections of society being involved in standards, providing an opportunity for everyone to share knowledge and make their voice heard.\\nBusinesses that do not focus on quality will quickly find that there are costs to be paid. Examples of these costs include waste due to products being badly made and therefore not being able to sell them. The reputation of a business will quickly deteriorate as a result of poor quality work.  Standards are continually changing so it is important for businesses to keep up. For example, ISO 9001 which is outlined in Section 4, started out originally as a British Standard, BS 5750 in 1979. It was developed as an international standard and became known as ISO 9001 in 1987. Today, the latest edition (2000) has been adopted by more than 400,000 organizations across the globe.
Censorship is a rather broad umbrella term. Just like communism, 100% no censorship is a grand idea, but it just doesn't work at that level. Being able to protest and march and speak as one pleases are good things not to censor. Having any book available to check-out at your local library is another good example. But where is the line drawn? In the United States, persons under the age of twenty-one cannot consume alcohol, and for most of the country, persons under the age of sixteen cannot operate automobiles on public streets and highways. Is this censorship? In the same country, pornography cannot be viewed and cigarettes cannot be smoked by persons under the age of eighteen. Although I do not consider the photograph in question as pornography, it is pretty darn close. As an umbrella term, "no censorship" can apply to anything. All rules and laws (Including the ones Wikipedia stands by) can be seen as censorship.

Baby Halloween Costume\\n\\nHalloween is most awaited by young and old alike as they can dress in costumes and scare the wits of others. Even babies are made to wear halloween costumes. In fact, baby halloween costumes are much in demand. People like to dress their babies in wonderful clothes and photograph them. Baby halloween costumes manufacturers make a huge profit during halloween season.\\n\\nHalloween is not just about costumes. Trick-or-treating, also known as guising, is an activity for children on Halloween in which they proceed from house to house in costumes, asking for treats such as candy with the question, "Trick or treat?" Trick-or-treating is one of the main traditions of Halloween. It has become socially expected that if one lives in a neighborhood with children one should purchase treats in preparation for trick-or-treaters. The National Confectioners Association reported in 2005 that 80 percent of adults in America planned to give out candy to trick-or-treaters, and that 93 percent of children planned to go trick-or-treating.

'''An antibiotic is a chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits or abolishes the growth of micro-organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, or protozoa. The term originally referred to any agent with biological activity against living organisms; however, "antibiotic" now is used to refer to substances with anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, or anti-parasitical activity. The first widely used antibiotic compounds used in modern medicine were produced and isolated from living organisms, such as the penicillin class produced by fungi in the genus Penicillium, or streptomycin from bacteria of the genus Streptomyces. With advances in organic chemistry many antibiotics are now also obtained by chemical synthesis, such as the sulfa drugs. Many antibiotics are relatively small molecules with a molecular weight less than 2000''' '''''Bold text'''''
{{user page}}\\nThe New England Antiquities Research Association (NEARA) is a non-profit organization which, according to its website: "is dedicated to a better understanding of our historic and prehistoric past through the study and preservation of New England's stone sites in their cultural context. Founded, 1964."[1] The current president of NEARA is Suzanne Carlson.\\n\\nMost NEARA members are curious about what they consider to be poorly understood archaeological sites in and around New England, containing features such as underground chambers, clusters of cairns, unusual walls, perched boulders, and engraved stones.  Some of these sites fall under the category of "ceremonial stone landscapes" by United South and Eastern Tribes, Inc.[2] in their recent resolution on the topic. NEARA members' interests include the documentation of lithic sites, the archaeoastronomy of sites, and their possible cultural origins. All members are interested in the preservation of the diversity of stone structures as part of New England's historic and prehistoric legacy.[3]\\n\\nMost NEARA members are not professional archaeologists or anthropologists. As such, members explore and document but do not dig or otherwise disturb sites. The organization does not take any official view about the origins of the stone sites, and individual members are free to form their own opinions, which range from colonial to Native American to pre-Columbian European interpretations.  \\n\\nNEARA sponsors field trips to visit sites and holds two conferences a year at which professional archaeologists and anthropologists, as well as amateur researchers, are often speakers. Membership information, as well as photographs and information about the sites themselves, can be found at their web site www.neara.org.

'''What is air pollution?'''\\n\\n‘I’ll go out for a breath of fresh air’ is an often-heard phrase. But how many of us realize that this has become irrelevant in today’s world, because the quality of air in our cities is anything but fresh.\\nThe moment you step out of the house and are on the road you can actually see the air getting polluted; a cloud of smoke from the exhaust of a bus, car, or a scooter; smoke billowing from a factory chimney, flyash generated by thermal power plants, and speeding cars causing dust to rise from the roads. Natural phenomena such as the eruption of a volcano and even someone smoking a cigarette can also cause air pollution.\\n\\n--[[User:Ilamaran|Ilamaran]] 14:49, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

== Necessity of Backup Power ==\\nAs long as the electricity is available, no one thinks much about it. The importance is realized when the power goes out. Whether it’s during the day or at night, electricity keeps our lives in order. It affects our business, our schedule and even our entertainment.\\n\\nElectricity runs everything in our everyday life. Think about it and you’ll see how much we depend on electricity to keep everything functioning. Gas stations can’t pump gas without it. Businesses have to close because their cash registers won’t work without it, or their computers won’t function. Banks and teller machines can’t function and must close. Restaurants, even fast food restaurants, can’t cook food without it. Our lives almost come to a standstill without electricity.\\n\\nThese are the times when back up electricity is most needed and becomes very important, especially at home. It keeps our lives in order and insures that everything goes on as normal as possible. It’s important to keep our daily schedule and backup electricity can do just that. Without it, our lives are chaos and our day can be ruined or a total loss.\\n\\nAll aspects of our world today depends on having electricity. In our homes, everything we need and enjoy is plugged into a wall socket and requires electricity. Therefore, backup electricity has become a necessity and is no longer a luxury. This is now true for businesses, hospitals and homes.
Ascaphus is the genus of primitive frogs that inhabit the mountain streams of northwestern North America.  However these frogs are not limited to streams but seasonally migrate upslope into the adjacent conifer forest, and so the habitat of these frogs is forested watersheds, not just streams.  The streams do need to have interstitial spaces under rocks.  If silt fills the interstitial spaces then the frogs and tadpoles have no cover and cannot survive.  The width of a riparian reserve should be what is needed to protect the stream from mud released by logging and related ground-disturbing activities, but ideally entire watersheds should be reserved - and protected from logging and road construction.

In time political unity was followed by important changes in spheres such as religion, language, culture, science, technology, trade and agriculture.  These changes survived the later slow political fragmentation of the region and contributed to the formation of a world which in many ways differed markedly from that of pre-Islamic times.  Very important changes occurred in the agricultural sector at least until 1100 CE and in some areas over a longer period.  Together they are sometimes referred to as the Arab Agricultural Revolution.   \\n\\nAgriculture evolved in three ways:  (1) the technologies for the capture, channeling, lifting, storage and spreading of irrigation water, nearly all inherited from the ancient world, were diffused much more widely than in ancient times and used  more intensively, sometimes in new combinations;  (2)  crops, nearly all of which originated outside the Islamic world, only a few of which had already appeared in limited areas in the lands conquered by the Arabs, were carried throughout the Islamic world and most were grown wherever soil, water and climate would allow their cultivation;  and (3) the improvements in irrigation combined with the new crops made much land more productive, including areas which had not previously been cultivated, and increased markedly the productivity agricultural labour by raising yields, introducing crops of higher value, and  using  labour (and land) over longer periods of the year.\\n\\nThe history of irrigation in West Asia appears to go back at least as far as the history of agriculture, and over the millennia which followed many  technologies were invented to control floods, store water, drain marshlands and irrigate cultivated lands.  The diffusion of these, however,  seems to have been spotty, so that in many parts of the ancient world they were  unknown or little used.  Furthermore, the centuries leading up to the rise of Islam saw a marked decline in irrigation in almost all regions the Arabs were to conquer.  This began in the western part of the Roman Empire as population dropped from c. 250 CE onwards, cities shrank, rural life became more insecure, and the money economy almost disappeared.   With the catastrophic Plague of Justinian in the late sixth and seventh centuries decline spread to Byzantium, the Sasanian Empire and the Arabian peninsula;  in some of these regions political decay and  various natural disasters further curtailed irrigated agriculture.  After the collapse of the dam of Ma’rib in the late-6th century, none of the great ancient works of irrigation in the Hadramaut was in operation.  In 626 CE a huge flood on the Tigris and Euphrates could not be contained and destroyed the important Nimrud dam, many other irrigation works, and much agricultural land. \\n\\nAfter the Arab conquests of the 7th and early-8th centuries, and the great movements of peoples across the early Islamic world, the irrigation losses of the late ancient  world were in large measure recovered and important advances were made.   These were based mainly on known technologies which were diffused  more widely, often into areas where they appear to have been unknown, and indeed over virtually all of the Islamic world.  As landowners and farmers found a wider range of possibilities for irrigation available, they could choose those techniques which were best suited to local environments.  Moreover, the greater choice of technologies  allowed for new combinations which could intensify irrigation, extend its duration, and allow its spread into new regions, large and small.  The lengthening of the period of irrigation through a greater part of the year was of special importance  since, as will be seen below, many of the new crops introduced  had originated in tropical regions and required intensive watering through the hot, dry summer months which characterized the climate of most of the Islamic world.   \\n		\\nOf the new crops which were diffused in the early-Islamic world, Andrew Watson has been able to study seventeen.  These include four crops which had already been introduced before the Arab conquests, namely rice, sugar cane, cotton and sorghum.    Their pre-Islamic distribution appears to have been very limited:  it was  confined entirely to the eastern part of the lands to be conquered by the Arabs, and within this large region it was limited to areas with warm winters, a constraint which seems to reflect the incomplete acclimatization of these plants to the cooler, non-tropical  climate of the region.  This acclimatization was to come in the centuries following the Arab conquests. Twelve other crops appear to have been first introduced into the Islamic world after the Arab conquests, many of them from the Indus Valley where they had arrived some centuries earlier and undergone some acclimatization.  These were sour (or Seville) oranges, lemons, limes, bananas, plantains, coconuts, watermelons, spinach, colocasia, eggplants and mangoes.  And finally, one new crop appeared which seems not to have been known anywhere in the pre-Islamic world:  this was  the artichoke, which was probably developed from the cardoon in Islamic times, possibly in the Maghrib.    Though these 18 crops were of varying economic and social importance, they all were diffused very widely across the vast territories of the early-Islamic world, seemingly coming to be grown almost wherever their cultivation was allowed by soil, water and climate.   The wider choice of crops allowed farmers to choose cropping patterns which were more flexible, better adapted to local conditions and more profitable.  \\n\\nThe appearance of the new crops, many of them summer crops in Islamic lands, and the availability of irrigation water in many places over most of the year were responsible for a considerable intensification of agriculture.  In most places in the ancient world rainfed farming yielded one crop every second winter;  during the remainder of the two-year period, the land was fallowed.   With the improvements in irrigation it became possible to produce four or more crops in a two-year period – indeed such results could be obtained in some areas which had never been cultivated or where farming had long been abandoned.   Though such startling changes were not uncommon, it is probably true that in most places the gains were less spectacular – but still of considerable importance.  These improvements in the productivity of both agricultural land and labour were connected  in complex ways to many developments outside the agricultural sector.   Most obviously, they were linked as both cause and effect to demographic increase, to a  marked rise in  urbanization of the early-Islamic world, to the growth in both local and long-distance trade, and to the increasing monetization of both rural and urban economies.  Although these connections are difficult to study in detail, their importance is evident.   Had the Arab agricultural revolution not occurred, the early-Islamic world would have been a very different place.     \\n\\n\\n\\n{{Reflist}}
GACP is an acronym which stands for "Generally Accepted Compliance Principles", which was conceived by the founders of Fortegrity, a new economy company in the GRC "Governance, Risk and Compliance" space. This standard currently exists only in theory, and it is the hope of the founders of Fortegrity and many others in the GRC community that such a standard will emerge. The benefits of broadly accepted standards in this area will great positive impact on organizations, as it will help guide them in complying with the myriad of regulations and mandates under which they fall, in a measured and efficient manner. \\n\\nSome groups do not have interest in the creation of such a standard. These ''may'' include accounting and consulting companies who benefit from the conflicting, overlapping, confusing, and otherwise daunting GRC matrix which result in their continued engagement in accounts they serve. Others may include politicians who benefit from discussion of problems, rather than their resolution. \\n\\n--Bubbalectual 14:59, 7 June 2007 (UTC)
The Seventh-day Adventist (abbreviated "Adventist"[3]) Church is a Christian denomination which is distinguished mainly by its observance of Saturday,[4] the original seventh day of the Judeo-Christian week, as the Sabbath. The denomination grew out of the Millerite movement in the United States during the middle part of the 19th century and was formally established in 1863.[5][6] Among its founders was Ellen G. White, whose extensive writings are still held in high regard by Seventh-day Adventists today.\\n\\nMuch of the theology of the Seventh-day Adventist Church corresponds to evangelical teachings such as the Trinity and the infallibility of Scripture. Distinctive teachings include the unconscious state of the dead and the doctrine of an investigative judgment. The church is also known for its emphasis on diet and health, its holistic understanding of the person, its promotion of religious liberty, and its conservative principles and lifestyle.\\n\\nThe world church is governed by a General Conference, with smaller regions administered by divisions, union conferences and local conferences. It currently has a worldwide membership of over 15 million people, has a missionary presence in over 200 countries and territories and is ethnically and culturally diverse.[2][1] The church operates numerous schools, hospitals and publishing houses worldwide, as well as a prominent humanitarian aid organization known as the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA).
I take a special interest in the history and science of cancer bacteria research. I have avidly studied this field for twenty five years, have conducted myriad interviews, initiated correspondences with leading and independent cancer organizations including NCI and ACS, and have compiled a sizeable library of published research, correspondences, audio tapes of interviews and newspaper records dating back to early 20th century.\\n\\nOver the years, I have grown from someone opinionated on the topic of "alternative medicine," to someone who has become totally dedicated to judicious presentation of facts and historical records, well aware of the many myths, half-truths and conjectures that exist regarding this subject. Unfortunatley, there is a fair amount of distorted information about cancer bacteria research both in the popular mainstream, and among so-called "advocates." Thus I feel it an obligation as a published author and medical journalist, to convey the highest quality information I am able in the hopes of promoting a better dialogue.
Hey there. I believe that the article regarding the benefits and precautions of veganism, or vegetarianism for that matter, misses the boat by citing mortality studies while failing to address quality of life issues. After all, it is not just the years in your life, but also the life in your years, that matter.  I would challenge someone to seek out more information on studies that might address the relative health of people, and not simply look at their ages at time of death. A meat eater may die at 90, but if he has survived two heart attacks, a bout with cancer, and been bedridden for 8 years, his quality of life is vastly different from a vegan who dies at 90 but was not ill, lived independently and could engage with family and friends until very near the end of life.[[User:Ginquiry|Ginquiry]] ([[User talk:Ginquiry|talk]]) 19:53, 1 March 2008 (UTC)

I found Adrian John's article on early 20th century sheet music piracy fascinating, seeing as I previously knew nothing about the subject. Digital music piracy is often discussed as if it is a new occurrence, while this forgotten history of sheet music proves otherwise. While the same issues of intellectual property, mass culture, media companies' control over the industry, etc. abounded during this time, there are some important differences to recognize. The early 20th century's lack of digital technology provided greater privacy for many pirates. Purchasers of pirated sheet music were protected by secrecy; once they paid for several copies of music they could walk home without the trace of an IP address. The publishing industry focused on larger distributors, and the unfortunate small-scale sheet music peddlers. Nowadays everyone is implicated in piracy. One could even say that the main pirated music distributors are better protected than small-scale consumers seeing as they have greater resources to hide their traces. Another important aspect is the greater support for public goods apparent at that time. As Willetts testified, there was support for a train monopoly that provided transportation for all. In our age of extreme privatization, there is little support for such a public good. Seeing as this was over 100 years ago, Johns may be focusing upon the support for music piracy more than was apparent at the time, similarly to how our culture vilifies piracy while often ignoring the popular support for piracy that does exist quietly. Even in this culture of providing for the public, however, piracy was still attacked by the government, possibly leading to the even more intense struggle against piracy that we have today.\\n[[User:EHammid|EHammid]] ([[User talk:EHammid|talk]]) 23:57, 3 April 2012 (UTC)
Over the past decade tremendous progress has been made in data mining methods like clustering, classification, frequent pattern mining, etc. However, unfortunately, the advanced implementations are often not made publicly available, and thus the results cannot be independently verified. This hampers the rapid advances in the field. There is thus a critical need to have open source implementations of important data mining methods. This workshop is the first such meeting place to discuss open source data mining methods. Since the scope of such a workshop can be rather broad, we focus our attention in the first year to Frequent Pattern Mining (FPM) problems. In subsequent years we will focus on open source implementations for other data mining problems like clustering, classification, outlier detection, etc. http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~zaki/OSDM05/
'''HOMOGENIZED DAIRY, THE DEPENDABLE CARDIOTOXIN'''\\nBY Rodney Julian   \\nWhen the “Father of Modern Cardiology,” the eminent physician Dr. Paul Dudley White, graduated from Harvard medical school in 1911, he had never encountered coronary thrombosis. As a practicing physician in Boston, on those rare occasions when a hospital had such a case, he and other physicians from the Boston area would gather to see this rare disease. Today, however, it has become so prevalent, it threatens almost all of us, young and old. So the question is “What happened between 1911 and now to facilitate this change?”\\nMany studies show evidence that cholesterol is the major contributor. Autopsy studies show that in American soldiers from the Vietnam War, 75% had evidence of atherosclerosis and high cholesterol buildup. The average age was 22 years old. It was natural to assume that since cholesterol was almost always present, it must be the leading cause of atherosclerosis. This assumption has continued to today. Many diets prescribed today by physicians or by diet specialists completely eliminate cholesterol.\\n\\nCholesterol is manufactured in our bodies. It is so important to the integrity of the body that all cells contain it. It is found in high concentrations in the brain. In addition to its role in the conduction of nerve impulses, cholesterol has an important structural role, as well as a biochemical role in endocrine production. Cholesterol synthesizes male and female hormones. Without cholesterol, vitamin D, which is required for calcium absorption, would not be synthesized. Bile originates in the liver from used or spent cholesterol and is essential for proper fat digestion. With all this evidence indicating the physiological importance of cholesterol, why would the body keep producing it throughout our evolution if it were eventually going to destroy us? It would seem that the human system takes adequate care of itself. Perhaps, we are not taking care of the system.\\n\\nThe answer to the discrepancy between needing cholesterol for survival and finding it in heart disease victims comes from Dr. Kurt A. Oster, cardiologist. After suffering from two heart attacks, he was inspired to research how the atherosclerotic process worked. He discovered that the enzyme xanthine oxidase (Xo), which is present in cow's milk (as well as the milk of sheep and goats), can be very destructive to heart and arterial tissue when the milk is homogenized. In raw milk, both the fat and Xo are digested in the stomach and small intestines. They are either used or excreted. Xo is found in the liver of many animals, where it breaks down compounds into uric acid waste products. Humans have a natural reservoir of Xo in the liver. One of its chief functions is to destroy used plasmalogen (in the liver only). And there are barriers, which prevent Xo from entering the bloodstream.\\n\\nWhen homogenized milk was introduced in 1932, we started to see increased atherosclerotic damage on a regular basis. Under pressure of 2500 pounds per square inch, at a speed of 600 feet per second, milk is passed through pipes and fine filters. This breaks up the fat particles and puts them in suspension like a foggy mist. The homogenized process encapsulates Xo into tiny fatty substances called liposomes. This protects Xo from stomach acids and allows it to pass through the intestinal walls and into the circulatory system.\\n\\nAt this point, while the liposomes are circulating in the blood, they are slowly burned up as energy fuel, only to expose the hidden core, which is in fact the enzyme xanthine oxidase. This dangerous situation is taking place outside the protection of the liver. Xo and plasmalogen cannot co-exist in one location. The liver, therefore, cannot store plasmalogen. It can only process or destroy it. So now this freshly exposed Xo circulating in the bloodstream, with nothing to stop it, starts to destroy plasmalogen, which makes up 30% of the membrane system in human heart muscle cells. In autopsies of people who died from heart and circulatory disease, plasmalogen was completely missing. Xo was in its place. Arterial inner linings were completely eaten away. The resulting lesions had become hardened by the deposition of minerals. Fatty streaks and cholesterol had surrounded the newly formed plaque by this time.\\n\\nThe appearance of cholesterol created widespread speculation that it was the cause of heart disease and not the result. The Xo process is slow and effectively destructive. Most 10-year-old children who have consumed homogenized milk have some form of atherosclerosis. In the case of American soldiers autopsied after combat fatalities, some had arteries as brittle as clay pipes.\\n\\nThere is a very high correlation between countries that drink homogenized milk and atherosclerosis. In countries where milk is boiled for safety reasons before drinking, Xo is destroyed in the process. However, boiling will rob the milk of vitamins, change its organic structure and convert it to a putrefied mess in the bowel. In children especially, it can lead to constipation, chronic sniffles and colds, and tonsillitis.\\n\\nIt has become trendy for health-conscious people to consume skim or low fat milk, but that only slows down the Xo process slightly. Besides that, low fat milk products will cause someone to gain weight. Farmers feed their pigs skim milk to fatten them up before the slaughter. If you look at commercially prepared homogenized milk in supermarkets, most brands state that vitamin D has been added. Unfortunately, vitamin D enhances Xo activity. Xo is not the only source of atherosclerosis, but it is a major contributor. People looking to improve their diet in a truly healthful manner would be wise to avoid all dairy products, except for those that are raw or cultured without homogenization.\\n\\nThis article was published in the Well Being Journal, Sep/Oct 2003, Vol 12, #5\\nRFJ

Algal Fuel, \\noil or third generation biofuel, is a biofuel from algae. (pond Scum etc) Compared with second generation biofuels, algae are high-yield high-cost (30 times more energy per acre than terrestrial crops) feedstocks to produce biofuels.\\n\\nAlgal fuels do not impact fresh water resources.\\n   [Http://AlgaeFuel.WS]\\nWith the record oil price increases since 2003, competing demands between foods and other biofuel sources and the world food crisis, there is much interest in algaculture (farming algae) for making vegetable oil, biodiesel, bioethanol, biogasoline, biomethanol, biobutanol and other biofuels.\\n\\nThe production of biofuels to replace oil and natural gas is in active development, focusing on the use of cheap organic matter (usually cellulose, agricultural and sewage waste) in the efficient production of liquid and gas biofuels which yield high net energy gain. One advantage of many biofuels over most other fuel types is that they are biodegradable, and so relatively harmless to the environment if spilled.\\n\\nThe United States Department of Energy estimates that if algae fuel replaced all the petroleum fuel in the United States, it would require 15,000 square miles (38,849 square kilometers), which is a few thousand square miles larger than Maryland, or 1.3 Belgiums. This is less than 1/7th the area of corn harvested in the United States in 2000.\\n\\nIn the 2008 U.S. Department of Energy Biomass and Biofuels Update to Congress (by the Office of Biomass Program) appears the move to algae fuels.\\n\\n [Http://AlgaeFuel.WS]

Network and Application Visibility \\nAs infrastructures become increasingly complex, organizations find significant gaps in their ability to monitor the performance of critical applications, and to gain actionable information to optimize application delivery. Application Visibility refers to the ability to understand an application’s operation dynamics. This include performance, security, availability, usage pattern, etc. Apparently, IT management team can most efficiently manage application delivery with such information.\\n\\nAccording to “The Value of Network and Application Visibility” written by Aberdeen group in 2008, Best-in-Class organizations which implemented application visibility tools reported: \\n\\n\\n120% average improvement in application availability \\n54% average improvement in Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) \\n85% success rate in preventing issues with application performance before end-user are impacted. \\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, traditional IT monitoring solutions are not effective when it comes to application level visibility, as they were mostly designed for network monitoring on device or TCP/UDP level. The techniques they used were typically Syslog, SNMP, and Flow (Netflow, sFlow). Today a wide variety of applications run in an enterprise environment. These include not only business critical applications such as SAP/Oracle, communication service such as VoIP, but also recreational applications like P2P file sharing, IM, and so on. Moreover Cloud Computing and SaaS (Software as a Service) are also driving applications to be webified and delivered from external providers. Many of these applications share common characteristics at network level, e.g. using TCP and same port number. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn this situation, only a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) solution is capable to provide accurate information about application traffic type and derive performance metrics such as response time. A DPI solution typically classifies network traffic into application types by looking deeply into every packet’s content (application header & payload) while doing wire-speed packet forwarding. It is an essential technology when it comes to providing complete Application Visibility.
Management in all business and organizational activities is the act of getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives using available resources efficiently and effectively. Management comprises planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization (a group of one or more people or entities) or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal. Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources and natural resources.\\nSince organizations can be viewed as systems, management can also be defined as human action, including design, to facilitate the production of useful outcomes from a system. This view opens the opportunity to 'manage' oneself, a pre-requisite to attempting to manage others.
Hi,\\n\\nI'm a newbie here, so please forgive me as I learn.\\n\\nThe travelogue film has a rich culture and history, which has been largely ignored by other film-related discussions. Indeed, the travelogue film was one of the earliest forms of filmmaking. It is, however, a hybrid art form, a combination of filmmaking, lecturing, entertainment, education, and performing art. Travelogue filmmakers make their films almost entirely alone or with a partner, relative, friend or spouse, without the aid of large crews, or, generally speaking, outside funding. They present an overview of a country or region, featuring its industry and culture, and travel around the continent showing their films and presenting them to the audience at a live theatrical event.\\n\\nI am a former Travel Adventure Film (Travelogue) Artist and I am interested in collaborating on articles relating to the history and culture of this unique and little-understood artform, and the unique, individual film artists who have produced them over the last century and more.
Trade Barriers\\n\\nJordon is located southwest of Asia on desert plains, surrounded by Israel, Syria, and Saudi Arabia. They established their independence in 1946, gaining the name Jordan in 1950. Jordan began to participate in the European Trade Association in 2001, after they acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2000 (CIA). \\nDuring the 1990s, Jordan’s performance was below its potential. From 2000 to\\n2002, Jordan achieved above expectations in terms of attracting FDI but its performance\\nin 2001 and 2002 was mainly a result of the September 11 attack. As performance lacked it’s potential in 2003 in answer to expectations of a war in Iraq.  Jordan became the only viable outlet for Iraqi imports and reconstruction efforts and the home of nearly 700,000 displaced Iraqis. In the aftermath of the Iraq War, FDI took off again and performance exceeded all expectations in 2004 and 2005. Regional events dictated the FDI inflows, in spite of the country’s seemingly unchanged potential for attracting FDI (Barriers).\\nEven though by 1999 Jordan was well into its economic reform, it was not performing at potential in terms of FDI inflows. Most reforms focused on macroeconomic frameworks (stability of the Jordanian dinar, increasing foreign reserves, liberalizing trade, reducing foreign debt, streamlining the budget, and reducing the budget deficit), rather than microeconomic adjustments to directly enhance the productivity of labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. As a result, the climate necessary for fostering FDI did not emerge during the reform process(Barriers)\\n\\nJordan currently imports 4.7% of it’s goods from the US (CIA). Certain non-tariff barriers impact US exports to Jordan. Jordan selectively imposes sanitary measures on fruits, vegetables, and beef to effectively create non-tariff barriers on imports of these products. Last year Jordan banned the importation of beef and live bovine animals after the BSE in Alabama broke out. \\nToday their exports consist of clothing, fertilizers, potash, phosphates, vegetables, and pharmaceuticals, consisting of $6.521 billion. Imports include crude oil, machinery, transport equipment, iron, and cereals in the amount of $15.65 billion (CIA).  \\n\\n\\nSources\\n\\nwww.freetheworld.com 4\\nOvercoming Barriers to Foreign Direct Investment in Jordan\\nhttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/
Matthew John St. Onge is known throughout his fiefdom as "The Stonge".  His coming was foretold by nearly every recorded civilization known throughout history.  \\n\\nApparently, there was an era of unforetold St. Onge power, that was initially quelled, but later again rose to power as it is today. The St. Onge bloodline has been found to be essential to the existence of several species today. Due to the extremely high white blood cell count found in all St. Onge blood, the St. Onge carrier is able to pass off some of thier white blood cells to assist creatures/humans with a low white blood cell count. Therefore, enhancing thier immune system, and allowing thier bodies to have disease fighting white blood cells. This common St. Onge trait is also being researched to help victims with the pandemic AIDS virus.
Triple Bottom Line In Accounting /Reporting\\nThe TBL is an accounting framework that incorporates three dimensions of performance: social, environmental and financial. This differs from traditional reporting frameworks as it includes ecological (or environmental) and social measures that can be difficult to assign appropriate means of measurement. The TBL dimensions are also commonly called the three Ps: people, planet and profits. \\nWhere it comes from?\\nWith the ratification of the United Nations and ICLEI TBL standard for urban and community accounting in early 2007, this became the dominant approach to public sector full cost accounting\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bottom_line\\nWhy used?\\nThe application of the TBL by businesses, nonprofits and governments are motivated by the principles of economic, environmental and social sustainability, but differ with regard to the way they measure the three categories of outcomes. Proponents who have developed and applied sustainability assessment frameworks like the TBL encountered many challenges, chief among them, how to make an index that is both comprehensive and meaningful and how to identify suitable data for the variables that compose the index.\\n\\n\\nWhy is it important in accounting ?\\nA model/concept for compelling business leaders to consider more than just money and it requires business leaders and owners to balance social, financial and environmental priorities (‘sustainable capitalism’)
 The content of science, as well as the meaning of the very idea of science, has continually evolved since the rise of modern science and before. The history of science is concerned with the intellectual paths that led to our present knowledge as well as those that were abandoned (and thus overlaps with the history of ideas, history of philosophy and intellectual history), and seeks to explain past beliefs—even those now considered erroneous—in their historical, cultural and intellectual contexts. It also forms the foundation of the philosophy of science and the sociology of science, as well as the interdisciplinary field of science, technology, and society, and is closely related to the history of technology.\\n\\nPeriodization in the historiography of science is usually oriented around the Scientific Revolution that culminated in the work of Isaac Newton. In this scheme, science (or more precisely, natural philosophy) before Copernicus was pre-modern science. European and Islamic science from antiquity to the 16th century was primarily derived from the work of Aristotle and other Greek philosophers (though historians now recognize the significant influence of Chinese knowledge as well); it included alchemy, astrology, and other subjects no longer considered scientific, as well as the precursors of the modern sciences. Science (still in the form of natural philosophy) from roughly the late 16th century until the early- to mid-19th century was early-modern science; the birth of the experimental method in the 17th and 18th centuries is often considered a central event in the history of science. The 19th century saw the professionalization and secularization of science and the creation of independent scientific disciplines; modern science can denote science since this period (in distinction to early-modern), all science since Newton (in distinction to pre-modern), or simply science as practiced now.
'''CARNet (Cerebral Autoregulation Network)''', is a multidisciplinary research community working together in the area of [[Cerebral_Autoregulation|cerebral autoregulation]] in order to promote and accelerate high quality research in this area.\\n\\n==Mission Statement==\\n\\nCerebral autoregulation refers to the physiological mechanisms that aim to maintain cerebral blood flow at an appropriate level, especially during changes in blood pressure. Due to the important influences of arterial carbon dioxide levels, cerebral metabolic rate, neural activation, activity of the sympathetic nervous system, posture, as well as other physiological variables, [[Cerebral_Autoregulation|cerebral autoregulation]] is often interpreted as also encompassing the wider field of cerebral blood flow regulation, including areas such as CO<sub>2</sub> reactivity, neurovascular coupling and other aspects of cerebral haemodynamics.\\n\\nUnderstanding and measuring autoregulation remains a big challenge, and despite great clinical interest and much research effort, benefit to patients has so far been limited.\\n\\nCARNet therefore aims to bring the multidisciplinary research community working in this area together in order to promote and accelerate high quality research by:\\n\\n* Sharing data\\n* Sharing methods, including experimental arrangements and data analysis\\n* Share results, experiences and ideas\\n\\nCARNet aims to create an environment of trust, openness and confidentiality in which free discussion of scientific ideas, data and results can flourish.\\n\\n== External links ==\\n* {{Official|http://www.car-net.org}}

Wikipedia has five pillars.  First, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.  Second, Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view.  Third, Wikipedia is free content that anyone can edit, use, modify, and distribute.  Fourth, Editors should interact with each other in a respectful and civil manner.  Fifth, Wikipedia does not have firm rules.\\n\\n2.  The "neutral point of view" refers to the fact that Wikipedia articles should be written and edited without bias.\\n\\n3.  The "no original research" policy means that all articles must come from reliable sources.  \\n\\n4.  The "verifiable policy" refers to the fact that all sources should be able to be checked easily.

A comparison of the images shows that where vegetation is dense, temperatures are cooler.\\n  |text= An '''[[urban heat island]]''' ('''UHI''') is a [[metropolitan area]] which is significantly warmer than its surrounding [[rural area]]s. The temperature difference usually is larger at night than during the day, and is most apparent when winds are weak. Seasonally, UHI is seen during both summer and winter. The main cause of the urban heat island is modification of the land surface by urban development which uses materials which effectively retain heat. Waste heat generated by energy usage is a secondary contributor. As a population centre grows, it tends to expand its area, and increase in its average temperature.\\n\\nMonthly [[precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]] is greater downwind of cities, partially due to the UHI.  Increases in heat within urban centres increases the length of [[growing season]]s, and decreases the occurrence of weak [[tornado]]es. The UHI decreases [[air quality]] by increasing the production of pollutants such as [[ozone]], and decreases water quality as warmer waters flow into area streams, which stresses their ecosystems. Despite concerns raised about its possible contribution to global warming, comparisons between urban and rural areas show that the urban heat island effects have little influence on global mean temperature trends.\\n\\nUHIs have the potential to directly influence the health and welfare of urban residents. As UHIs are characterized by increased temperature, they can potentially increase the magnitude and duration of heat waves within cities. Research has found that the mortality rate during a heat wave increases exponentially with the maximum temperature, an effect that is exacerbated by the UHI. The nighttime effect of UHIs can be particularly harmful during a heat wave, as it deprives urban residents of the cool relief found in rural areas during the night\\n\\nNot all cities have a distinct UHI. Mitigation of the urban heat island effect can be accomplished through the use of [[green roof]]s and the use of lighter-coloured surfaces in urban areas, which reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat.\\n  |link=Urban heat island\\n}}
TRANS FAT AND HEALTH\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\nTrans Fat and Health\\n\\nHeart disease and obersity are increasing in frequency amongst young people in all countries. Some blame this on a lack of exercise and the propensity to eat junk food. Although being a couch potato is a major contributing factor, the greatest contributor to obersity is the consumption  of trans fats. Trans fat is created by adding hydrogen to plant oils to crease “unsaturated fats”. This gives the plant oils a higher melting temperature (which helps with baking) and a longer shelf life, making them more commercially viable. Since no trans fat is found in nature. It is not beneficial to our health. In fact, it increases our cholesterol level and thereby increases the risk of heart disease.\\nAdding hydrogen to fat was pioneered by Paul Sabatier, and he earned a Nobel Prize for his efforts Proctor & Gamble, a U.S company, was the first to market a commercial product with unsaturated fat in 1911 called Crisco Shortening.\\nThe product became hugely popular after they distributed a free cookbook filled with recipes calling for Crisco Shortening. The products was cheap, and it was also said to be healthier than saturated fats like butter.\\nIt will untill 1987 that critics began to speak out against trans fat. In 1994, it was estimated that over 30,000 people died of heart disease associated with trans fats. Crisco, facing a possible ban on their Shortening, had a change of heart and made an effort to remove trans fats from their products. Last years, over 12,5 million Americans were diagnosed with heart disease, and more than 500,000 died.\\nThe greatest influence trans fat has on the body is an increase in the risk of heart disease. A 1976 study of 120,000 nurses showed that for every 2% increase in trans fat consumed, the risk of heart disease doubled. Heart disease is not the only negative health effect, diabetes, obesity, liver dysfunction and infertility go hand in hand with trans fat consumption. A six-year experiment on monkeys found that, even though all monkeys consumed the same number of calories per day, monkeys who are trans fats gained 7,2% of their body weight. Monkeys who consumed no trans fat only gained 1,8% of their body weight.\\nAll food labels are required to show amounts of trans fat. Try to choose products with lower amounts of fat. Use alternate fats like monosaturated and polyunsaturated fats (olive, canola, soy bean, corn and sunflower oils) Avoid foods high in trans fats such as cookies, cakes and chips if you want to stay in shape.
{{Ambassadors help}}\\n==Course description==\\nThis course deals with the scientific principles relevant to conservation, biodiversity, and [[sustainability]] in a human-dominated world. Topics include concepts of [[biodiversity]], threats to, and conservation of biodiversity, and complex issues related to the preservation of biodiversity and the environment in a human-dominated world. Recent predictions of the extent and consequences of global [[climate change]] and its effects will be emphasized as part of this course.\\n\\nThe topics in BIOL/ENTM 4015 are designed for undergraduate science majors. The primary goal is the development of critical knowledge and evaluation skills needed as an educated citizen in a complex and rapidly deteriorating world. We are well into the sixth known mass extinction of life on Earth. Estimates are that as many as 60,000 species now go extinct annually, and massive changes in natural environments resulting from human actions will have long-lasting consequences for all [[life form]]s that survive. Ongoing [[Population_growth#Human_population_growth_rate|population growth]] worldwide and accelerating changes in global climate will likely hasten the [[Holocene extinction|mass extinction and threaten life as we know it within your lifetime]]. \\n\\nConservation is an interdisciplinary field, drawing from biological disciplines (ecology, evolution, genetics, biogeography, [[systematics]], forestry, wildlife biology, agronomy, and marine sciences), as well as physical sciences, like soils, water chemistry, geography and geology. These scientific disciplines are combined with social sciences, such as sociology, political science, economics, and anthropology. All these disciplines produce information that is evaluated in the context of ethics and philosophy. Practitioners include people in a wide variety of fields of science and humanities, both in public and private organizations and businesses, and the general public (in short, all humans, in one way or another). Critical evaluation of ideas and information is needed by all educated citizens to evaluate and handle controversial issues, because ignorance and apathy are courses of action with important consequences.

The purpose of the assignment is two-fold. First, this is a pilot study to explore the ease of implementing Wikipedia as a learning tool in the classroom. We initially will evaluate how information can be incorporated into existing articles and subsequently explore creating new articles on conservation related topics. Student input will be used to evaluate the process. Second, Wikipedia will be used as a platform for students to communicate effectively scientific processes involving conservation to the global community. Distilling science in a manner that is understandable at all levels is essential to promote conservation of the environment. Students will evaluate existing information, determine if it is unbiased, along with including recent information as new research develops, and work to communicate the information effectively.\\n\\n===Assignment timeline===\\nStudents will present their work on Wikipedia topics during their Hot Topic presentations, scheduled for April 7th.

Alison Firich\\n Salt Wedging\\n1.	The type of weathering is salt wedging.  Salt wedging occurs in arid climates and coastal areas.  It occurs when saline or salt gets into cracks of the rocks, evaporates, and leaves crystals of salt behind.  The rock disintegrates or expands due to the saline solution’s effects.\\n2.	The rate of weathering is affected by the freshwater runoff in the particular area.  If there is no runoff of freshwater, then the salt water will be more diluted.  \\n3.	Salt wedging can be expected to be found in coastal regions near ocean (salt) waters!
'''To improve is to change; to be perfect is to keep changing''' - these are the words I try to live by best as I can.\\n\\nOn a personal level, I take a keen interest in philosophy, psychology (psychopathy in particular), the meaning of things, human perplexing irrationality and the biases that we seem unable to get rid of. One of the most fascinating things I wish to understand is the power of familiarity and how it impacts the way we see the world, often quite literally. We see what we expect to see, we find what we are looking to find. I find it most disappointing so many of us appear to be especially keen to find offense.\\n\\nProfessionally, I busy myself with IT, data ownership and rights, the rise of a surveillance economy and the dangers posed by the ubiquity and proliferation of personal data under corporate and governmental control. I believe such collection of data and the algorithmic analysis of it pose an enormous danger to free societies and are almost certain to lead to a data-enforced dystopian future; not by design, not by malice, but by default.\\n\\nWikipedia is my go-to online content from where I expand my knowledge and try to find all the nuances so direly missing from public discourse. I hope that one day my accomplishments in the area of personal liberty and sovereignty may warrant me having my own entry :)
Spatial opacity\\n\\nSpatial opacity is everything that interrupts any type of spatial flows. Spatial opacity can be natural (mountains, hills, lakes, rivers and so on) and not natural (traffic lights, intersections, doors and so on). Spatial opacity surrounds us and we can not escape from it which and it is slowing us down.\\n\\nIn order to think about spatial opacity (not natural) you have to imagine space as a connected network where everything is connected with each other. From Tobler's first law of Geography we know that close things are more related than distant things. Nowadays every single place on earth can be reached with different degrees of difficulty.\\n\\nSpatial Opacity in our daily lives:\\n\\nBy getting up in the morning we normally face our first spatial opacity by opening the bathroom door, going donwstairs (taking the stairs). By taking the car we have to follow the road network we are given by nature (natural opacity) and by the way roads have been built (non natural). Slower cars in front of us, intersections, traffic lights everything slows us down and is part of the spatial opacity.\\n\\n\\n\\nCourses:\\n\\nThe main input from the courses is a very theoretical overview of the material. Depending on the subject, you may get some applied examples on how the theory matches real examples. \\nThe courses include a lot of training in statistics as well as approaches to spatial planning with computer support (GIS). All courses are presented with Powerpoint support and in the English language. \\nMany courses treat various policy issues on spatial planning of the European Union as well as political issues within the different EU Member States. In addition to that, there are some courses about sustainability in terms of spatial planning. \\nMost of the courses are related to the European Union and do not necessarily treat spatial planning of non-EU member States.
