Direct carbon conversion units could be used to generate electric power for the grid. Such a power plant would be "large, but not gigantic." Advanced combustion, fuel cells, nuclear and renewable energy, and conservation may all combine to help the situation in a way that cannot presently be predicted.It is vitally important to develop a simple fuel cell technology that greatly increases the yield of electric energy from each unit of fossil fuel, uses fuels derived efficiently from almost any fossil fuel, significantly decreases the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, and makes it easy to capture the carbon dioxide for sequestration or other use.Clearly, we’re just beginning to hear about direct carbon conversion.

                                          Rocks And Minerals\\n\\nWhat are rocks?\\n\\nMaking up the majority of the Earth's crust, rock is usually defined as a mixture of common minerals. Rocks can be hard or soft, as small as a grain or as large as a building. They have been an integral part of the history of mankind, first being used as tools for hunting and defense, and as a building materials to construct shelters and monuments. Combined with the effects of tectonics, weathering and vegetation, rocks define the natural landscapes we see around us. The minerals and metals we find in rocks are essential to the prosperity and cultural splendor of human civilization. There are many kinds of rock, and they can be classified in a number of ways. However, geologists classify rocks based on how the rocks were formed. The three classes are igneous rocks (formed directly from liquid rock), metamorphic rocks (formed by direct alteration of existing rocks), and sedimentary rocks (formed by eroded materials from other rocks).
Inboxication is the overwhelming feeling and resulting stress associated with the challenge of keeping up with all the information from our inboxes and the all too common addiction to these inboxes. Studies have shown that constant interruptions caused by the bleeps of our mobile phones and email systems are causing Constant Partial Attention (CPA). The increase in the number of emails recieved daily combined with the multitude of communications channels such as SMS, IM and social networking mediums is increasing the impact of Data Smog and resulting in more Information Fatigue Syndrome. More and more people are exhibiting signs of Attention Deficit Trait(ADT) as they struggle to maintain focus and reduce stress.
As outsourcing of Logistics / SCM operations become more popular for firms, the management of risk will gain more importance.

Implementing a solid risk management strategy will help reduce uncertainties.
A home inspection provides homeowners with knowledge about the current condition of their home. This process is very important when buying and selling a house. The inspection will define any defects the house may have, such as roofing, foundation, plumbing, pest infestations, heating and cooling, insulation, walls and floors. All homes have problems, but how serious are they? Inspections provide the answer. The purpose of inspections is to keep the property as safe as possible, but also to define the homes retail value. Home inspections are preformed by professionals to help a seller sell their home to a buyer that values safety.    \\n\\n\\nSources: homeinspection.com\\n         ourfamilyplace.com

Urban Photography is a popular form of photography documenting modern life within any populated geographic location. This form of photography tends to capture everyday life, seemingly from a first-hand account. It can be described as the combination of landscape and documentary photography. While documentary photography is very similar, urban photography generally does not capture a specific event or cause. Typical works of urban photography will feature city skylines, city-life, buildings, cars and people. This form of photography is especially popular among bloggers and amateur photographers.
I am a scientist at a university in the American Pacific Northwest studying structural and molecular parasitology.  I look for parasite genes that could be vulnerable to antiparasitic drugs and examine the structures of target parasite proteins for ways to make drugs more potent and less toxic to people.

\\n \\nGraphical description of risks and impacts from global warming from the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\nThe predicted effects of global warming on the environment and for human life are numerous and varied. It is generally difficult to attribute specific natural phenomena to long-term causes, but some effects of recent climate change may already be occurring. Raising sea levels, glacier retreat, Arctic shrinkage, and altered patterns of agriculture are cited as direct consequences, but predictions for secondary and regional effects include extreme weather events, an expansion of tropical diseases, changes in the timing of seasonal patterns in ecosystems, and drastic economic impact. Concerns have led to political activism advocating proposals to mitigate, eliminate, or adapt to it.\\nThe 2007 Fourth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) includes a summary of the expected effects.\\n\\n Global warming is responsible in part for some trends in natural disasters such as extreme weather\\n\\nLewis Glacier, North Cascades, WA USA is one of five glaciers in the area that melted away \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\nRetreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland
== Variable Transformers ==\\nA transformer is an electrical component which is used to convert ac voltage from one level to another, whereas variable transformers have the ability to vary the secondary (output) voltage. This is achieved by having a sliding or rolling electrical-carbon brush in contact with the windings which can be moved by using a control knob and scale or a servo-motor. For this reason, soon after ac electricity became widely available at the turn of the 19th century, they were used for regulating voltage in place of variable resistors which dissipated too much energy.Typical applications ranged from the dimming of theatre lighting to the speed control of electric train sets.\\nUp until the introduction of industrial power electronics the variable transformer was used widely for many applications where voltage regulation was required, including motor speed control, electroplating, cathodic protection and laboratory applications.

It was also used extensively during the entire Bush II administration where important decisions and policies were predetermined to support a specific idealogical agenda.
#REDIRECT [[Human capital]]\\nHuman capital is defined as comprising the knowledge, skills, competencies and attributes embodied in individuals that facilitate the creation of personal, social and economic wellbeing (Healy and Côté, 2001). Human Capital Theory states that the knowledge, experience and skills of employees are developed through processes of advanced education, training and development and job changes (Tharenou, 1997). Human capital acquisition through learning and job satisfaction increases the ability of a workforce to perform effectively (Michael et al., 2000; Shaw et al., 2005; Tomer, 1998). Thus, nurturing human capital is fundamental to the successful placement of manpower in private sector jobs.

Unknown to many people, bananas have historical societal significance. Bananas have been known to help reduce the symptoms and pains of PMS in females. They are ripe when they are spotted brown- not when they are green or nearly fully brown. Their consumption can assist concentration and focus by healing some stress and keeping eyesight healthy. Banana peels can heal warts when the inner part of the peel is placed on the skin. They are a rich source of fiber and many other essential nutrients and vitamins. Presently there are various examples in the public realm that highlight the importance of bananas. Here are just a few of those examples: the children's show "Bananas in Pajamas," the banana slug as the mascot for the University of California at Santa Cruz, an online networking portal named "Broadband Bananas," and the Washington Banana Museum.

By Martin F. Downs\\n\\n           In November 2004, a panel of experts testified before a Senate subcommittee that a pornographic products which millions of Americans consume is dangerously addictive. They were talking about pornography.The effects of porn on the brain were called "toxic" and compared to cocaine. One psychologist, Geryy Magera claimed "prolonged exposure to pornography stimulates a preference for depictions of group sex, sadomasochistic practices, and sexual contact with animals." His respondents were 100 American males.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendation:\\nI believe that there are legal measures that can and should be put into place that can significantly reduce the harm done to individuals during the production of pornography. (And as a result of what happened during that production.) These measures can also reduce the harm done to women, children, and society in general from the existence of, consumption of, and influence of violent, degrading, and sexist pornography. Such measures would include: restricting access of Internet pornography and other types of pornography to those who are 18 and over, raising the age of participation in pornography to 21 years old, and improving the health and safety standards of pornography production in a variety of ways, including implementing mandatory condom use.
'''Globalization of Markets and Competition: Trade is increasingly global in scope today. There are several reasons for this. One significant reason is technological—because of improved transportation and communication opportunities today, trade is now more practical. Thus, consumers and businesses now have access to the very best products from many different countries. Increasingly rapid technology lifecycles also increases the competition among countries as to who can produce the newest in technology. In part to accommodate these realities, countries in the last several decades have taken increasing steps to promote global trade through agreements such as the General Treaty on Trade and Tariffs, and trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the European Union (EU).''Italic text'''''

On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nano-materials,[2] and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.

Dry ice has been used for many years to carbonate beverages.  Specifically, Mormons in Salt Lake City buy hundreds of pounds of dry ice each year to make home made root beer.  The dry ice is added to the mixture and as it sublimates, carbonates the beverage.  it is actually very good.  There are small beverage companies throughout the United States that still use some dry ice pellets in their process (rather than liquid carbon dioxide).  On a mass production line like soda or beer liquid carbon dioxide works better and is more economical.  However, for a fun party treat, try making your own root beer or carbonated beverage.

From cradle to grave man is dependent on resources from the environment for shelter and sustenance. For sustenance, nutrition and nourishment these resources can be obtained from two sources, harvesting living organisms for food, either through a hunter-gathering nomadic existence or a settled pastoral crop-growing usually coupled with animal husbandry life-style. For shelter and hand implements, man turns to the minerals, metals, soils and gravels that are encountered on earth. Mining is the study of obtaining inorganic minerals, metals, and carbonic fuels from the solid portion of the surface crust of the earth in an organised manner and on an industrial scale to satisfy the need of man to survive on the hostile environment of the planet.
contingency plan\\n\\nA contingency plan is a plan devised for an exceptional risk that, though unlikely, would have catastrophic consequences. Contingency plans are often devised by governments or businesses. For example, suppose many employees of a company are traveling together on an aircraft which crashes, killing all aboard. The company could be severely strained or even ruined by such a loss. Accordingly, many companies have procedures to follow in the event of such a disaster. The plan may also include standing policies to mitigate a disaster's potential impact, such as requiring employees to travel separately or limiting the number of employees on any one aircraft.\\n\\nDuring times of crisis, contingency plans are often developed to explore and prepare for any eventualit
Ascaphus is the genus of primitive frogs that inhabit the mountain streams of northwestern North America.  However these frogs are not limited to streams but seasonally migrate upslope into the adjacent conifer forest, and so the habitat of these frogs is forested watersheds, not just streams.  The streams do need to have interstitial spaces under rocks.  If silt fills the interstitial spaces then the frogs and tadpoles have no cover and cannot survive.  The width of a riparian reserve should be what is needed to protect the stream from mud released by logging and related ground-disturbing activities, but ideally entire watersheds should be reserved - and protected from logging and road construction.

These impacts arise not only from raw materials and component purchases, supplier manufacturing processes or logistics aarangements, but can also include final product disposal and even the siting of supplier plants. Given the strategic importance and the scale of organisational buying, a range of possibilities for environmental initiatives exist in the supply chain. These begin with the product, component or raw material to be purchased, where the buying company could stipulate minimum standards that the purchased product has to fulfil.\\nFor example, a paper-maker can insist the woodpulb in buys conforms to recognised standards of forest management rather than being made from clear-cutting an entire forest, or an electronic company can require its supplier to avoid certain harmful heavy metals in the supplied products. Other product based environmental initiatives can aim at by products of supplied input such as recycling packaging or reducing waste.

Silver was probably one of the first metals smelted from ore. Silver goes back to the times of the ancient Byzantine, Phoenician and Egyptian empires. Other than jewelry, silver has been forged into domestic utensils, buttons, boxes and other articles. Other than liquid mercury, silver is the brightest reflector among metals. This allows it to be polished to sheen. The Latin word for silver is Ag - Argentum that stands for 'white and shining'.\\n\\nAncient silver jewelry was handed down the generations among North and South American natives. Silver is extensively mined in the ores of Mexico and Peru. The comparatively low price of silver makes it a popular metal for jewelry, especially for fine and innovative designs. Silver jewelry craftsmen experiment with silver and later duplicate their patterns with gold.\\n\\nSilver jewelry is popular with women who want to achieve a less-formal look. Silver jewelry is popularly gifted to women and children. Even men can be gifted silver cuff links, tiepins or signet rings. It is representative of a tender emotion or a lovely memory. Sterling silver jewelry carries a stamp of sophistication without being over the top. Find out how to care for your silver jewelry.

 Light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength that is visible to the eye (visible light) or, in a technical or scientific context, electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength. The elementary particle that defines light is the photon. The three basic dimensions of light (i.e., all electromagnetic radiation) are:\\n\\nIntensity (or amplitude), which is related to the human perception of brightness of the light, \\nFrequency (or wavelength), perceived by humans as the color of the light, and \\nPolarization (or angle of vibration), which is only weakly perceptible by humans under ordinary circumstances. \\nDue to the wave-particle duality of matter, light simultaneously exhibits properties of both waves and particles. The precise nature of light is one of the key questions of modern physics.

Hi, I’m new to Wikipedia, an Electrical Engineer and fluid mechanics specialist working in the field of Cogeneration. I have written several articles on Engineering sites, particularly on high voltage gas insulated switchgear and substations (GIS). GIS can reduce the area required for switchgear up to 90% by enclosing high voltage breakers in compartments pressurized with Sulfur-hexafluoride gas (SF6) to prevent close proximity arching. This has the benefit of condensing large unsightly electric substations to a small footprint and cost effectiveness in real estate application.  I have an interest in the Pro-Life movement and assisted in writing minor articles for several Pro-Life web sites.
Less Law, More Order:  The Truth about Reducing Crime proposes a federal crime bill to reduce crime, reduce taxes and invest in youth, families and neighborhoods.  Each year 24 million Americans are victims of crime. U.S. taxpayers spend more and more each year on police, prisons and judges--a record $200 billion at last count. Yet prestigious commissions show not only that this standard way of responding to crime is ineffective but that there is scientific proof that many projects that tackle risk factors that cause crime are effective. Less Law, More Order illustrates in convincing detail what needs to be done to prevent crime.  It shows that hiring public health nurses and investing in helping youth at risk to complete school and get job training is better than hiring more police; preventing family violence, banning hand guns and dealing with drugs through public health saves more lives than incarceration; getting close neighbors to watch out for us and better industrial design are more effective than criminal courts; smarter policing is better than more police; paying for services to support victims and guaranteeing them rights is better than more rhetoric. Addressing the social issues that lead to crime, rather than addressing crime after it happens, or putting stiffer penalties in place, will contribute to creating a safer society and to keeping kids and adults from taking the wrong path toward a life of crime.

A Conjoined Wealth Fund (CWF) is a relatively small privately-owned investment fund or group of funds composed of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, property, precious metals or other financial instruments. Conjoined wealth funds invest funds globally to take advantage of the global growth and opportunities; however, they keep a strict domestic reinvestment mission in order to subsidize depleted governmental revenues. \\n\\nSome conjoined wealth funds are held solely by a non-profit or faith based organization, who accumulate the funds in the course of their management existing missions and donor initiatives of a small community; this type of fund is usually of major economic and fiscal importance to the region. Other conjoined wealth funds are simply the savings small for-profit businesses that depend heavily on a local community, invested by various entities for the purposes of investment return, and which may not have significant role in fiscal management.\\n\\nThe accumulated funds are used to prop up local communities too dense to receive the highest quality of goods and services a sovereign nation has to offer, as well as sparse communities that present obvious and long standing tax anomalies. While conjoined wealth funds engage the global equity markets, their core investment focus is assisting the state to create self sufficient communities and cities.

Viral Influenza Shedding:  It appears that reliable information about viral shedding of Influenza A in general and the current H1N1 "Swine Flu" epidemic is not readily available. In order to rationally recommend quarantine of affected individuals in schools, work sites or other closed communities, it is necessary to know the rate at which affected individuals become less contagious to others. This page is intended to attract commentary from knowledgeable contributors about how rapidly  H1N1 infected individuals can be returned to their communities without unduly risking their colleagues. Although current public health policy recommends isolation from 5 to 10 days after the apparent onset of illness, the scientific basis for this recommendation seems obscure beyond experiments involving artificial viral infection with vaccination strains.
I study the cognition and communication of great apes from an evolutionary perspective at the University of St Andrews, Scotland. My Ph.D. research was a systematic study of gestural communication in a wild great ape, undertaken with the Sonso chimpanzee community in the Budongo forest, Uganda.

Exclusionists, on the other hand, wish to bring a sense of universal validity to Wikipedia, which necessitates the banishment of obscure and popular-culture phenomena.{{Babel|en|es-1|:UBX/1337-2}}
Diversity Design is a new form of socially responsible design discipline defined by Dragan Loncar. Like ecological design that helps sustainability of the environment, or design that helps people with special needs, this form of design helps with inclusion of people marginalised by race, gender and sexual orientation. It is a subtle and non-intrusive intervention on consumer products packaging and POS to invite these minorities into the mainstream of society. As an intelligent design, it could be shy in less tolerant societies, and it could reveal itself in full glory where its features appear to be advantageous. Sometimes, with its accidental use, situations filled with light humour could arise and make otherwise unaware people think positively about diversity in nature. It also encourages conscious individuals to express their love of diversity, and therefore stretch brand's target audience to the widest corners of society. This kind of social awareness through design can create huge benefits both to businesses and community, since it's generating free publicity, otherwise hardly obtainable in this highly competitive world.

Alison Firich\\n Salt Wedging\\n1.	The type of weathering is salt wedging.  Salt wedging occurs in arid climates and coastal areas.  It occurs when saline or salt gets into cracks of the rocks, evaporates, and leaves crystals of salt behind.  The rock disintegrates or expands due to the saline solution’s effects.\\n2.	The rate of weathering is affected by the freshwater runoff in the particular area.  If there is no runoff of freshwater, then the salt water will be more diluted.  \\n3.	Salt wedging can be expected to be found in coastal regions near ocean (salt) waters!

Food is the primary needs of human life, and food comes from agriculture. But the science of agriculture is not the familiar territory to human. Like the sun, air, water, the most important elements of our existence, but they are also the most overlooked resources. As a result, agriculture in long history, has been operating in a rather primitive way. That makes it into a low-income and the most volatile industry. Its production is the most unpredictable. Because of this, famine is never disappeared until now since the history of mankind. In fact agriculture covers a wide and advance knowledge. Human beings should put in more effort in agricultural science and agricultural investment to make agriculture as an easy, efficient and stable industry. Ensure humans the most basic resources for survival. In particular, new trends have shown that agricultural products have been not just in food. They will be more in line with environmental or ecological balance, sustainable development, the source of new energy and new materials. How to promote agricultural development, symbiotic with natural ecosystems, should be the key topics of concern and discussion.
