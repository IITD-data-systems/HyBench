Direct carbon conversion units could be used to generate electric power for the grid. Such a power plant would be "large, but not gigantic." Advanced combustion, fuel cells, nuclear and renewable energy, and conservation may all combine to help the situation in a way that cannot presently be predicted.It is vitally important to develop a simple fuel cell technology that greatly increases the yield of electric energy from each unit of fossil fuel, uses fuels derived efficiently from almost any fossil fuel, significantly decreases the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, and makes it easy to capture the carbon dioxide for sequestration or other use.Clearly, we’re just beginning to hear about direct carbon conversion.

                                          Rocks And Minerals\\n\\nWhat are rocks?\\n\\nMaking up the majority of the Earth's crust, rock is usually defined as a mixture of common minerals. Rocks can be hard or soft, as small as a grain or as large as a building. They have been an integral part of the history of mankind, first being used as tools for hunting and defense, and as a building materials to construct shelters and monuments. Combined with the effects of tectonics, weathering and vegetation, rocks define the natural landscapes we see around us. The minerals and metals we find in rocks are essential to the prosperity and cultural splendor of human civilization. There are many kinds of rock, and they can be classified in a number of ways. However, geologists classify rocks based on how the rocks were formed. The three classes are igneous rocks (formed directly from liquid rock), metamorphic rocks (formed by direct alteration of existing rocks), and sedimentary rocks (formed by eroded materials from other rocks).
Inboxication is the overwhelming feeling and resulting stress associated with the challenge of keeping up with all the information from our inboxes and the all too common addiction to these inboxes. Studies have shown that constant interruptions caused by the bleeps of our mobile phones and email systems are causing Constant Partial Attention (CPA). The increase in the number of emails recieved daily combined with the multitude of communications channels such as SMS, IM and social networking mediums is increasing the impact of Data Smog and resulting in more Information Fatigue Syndrome. More and more people are exhibiting signs of Attention Deficit Trait(ADT) as they struggle to maintain focus and reduce stress.
As outsourcing of Logistics / SCM operations become more popular for firms, the management of risk will gain more importance.

A home inspection provides homeowners with knowledge about the current condition of their home. This process is very important when buying and selling a house. The inspection will define any defects the house may have, such as roofing, foundation, plumbing, pest infestations, heating and cooling, insulation, walls and floors. All homes have problems, but how serious are they? Inspections provide the answer. The purpose of inspections is to keep the property as safe as possible, but also to define the homes retail value. Home inspections are preformed by professionals to help a seller sell their home to a buyer that values safety.    \\n\\n\\nSources: homeinspection.com\\n         ourfamilyplace.com

Urban Photography is a popular form of photography documenting modern life within any populated geographic location. This form of photography tends to capture everyday life, seemingly from a first-hand account. It can be described as the combination of landscape and documentary photography. While documentary photography is very similar, urban photography generally does not capture a specific event or cause. Typical works of urban photography will feature city skylines, city-life, buildings, cars and people. This form of photography is especially popular among bloggers and amateur photographers.
I am a scientist at a university in the American Pacific Northwest studying structural and molecular parasitology.  I look for parasite genes that could be vulnerable to antiparasitic drugs and examine the structures of target parasite proteins for ways to make drugs more potent and less toxic to people.

\\n \\nGraphical description of risks and impacts from global warming from the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\nThe predicted effects of global warming on the environment and for human life are numerous and varied. It is generally difficult to attribute specific natural phenomena to long-term causes, but some effects of recent climate change may already be occurring. Raising sea levels, glacier retreat, Arctic shrinkage, and altered patterns of agriculture are cited as direct consequences, but predictions for secondary and regional effects include extreme weather events, an expansion of tropical diseases, changes in the timing of seasonal patterns in ecosystems, and drastic economic impact. Concerns have led to political activism advocating proposals to mitigate, eliminate, or adapt to it.\\nThe 2007 Fourth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) includes a summary of the expected effects.\\n\\n Global warming is responsible in part for some trends in natural disasters such as extreme weather\\n\\nLewis Glacier, North Cascades, WA USA is one of five glaciers in the area that melted away \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\nRetreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland
== Variable Transformers ==\\nA transformer is an electrical component which is used to convert ac voltage from one level to another, whereas variable transformers have the ability to vary the secondary (output) voltage. This is achieved by having a sliding or rolling electrical-carbon brush in contact with the windings which can be moved by using a control knob and scale or a servo-motor. For this reason, soon after ac electricity became widely available at the turn of the 19th century, they were used for regulating voltage in place of variable resistors which dissipated too much energy.Typical applications ranged from the dimming of theatre lighting to the speed control of electric train sets.\\nUp until the introduction of industrial power electronics the variable transformer was used widely for many applications where voltage regulation was required, including motor speed control, electroplating, cathodic protection and laboratory applications.

Bushsonian logic is a strategy used in governance to build policies based on idealogies, predetermined decisions, selective fact usage, fact exageration, fact supression, and information fabrication. Used primarily in the run up to war between the United States and Iraq in the early 21st century. It was also used extensively during the entire Bush II administration where important decisions and policies were predetermined to support a specific idealogical agenda.
#REDIRECT [[Human capital]]\\nHuman capital is defined as comprising the knowledge, skills, competencies and attributes embodied in individuals that facilitate the creation of personal, social and economic wellbeing (Healy and Côté, 2001). Human Capital Theory states that the knowledge, experience and skills of employees are developed through processes of advanced education, training and development and job changes (Tharenou, 1997). Human capital acquisition through learning and job satisfaction increases the ability of a workforce to perform effectively (Michael et al., 2000; Shaw et al., 2005; Tomer, 1998). Thus, nurturing human capital is fundamental to the successful placement of manpower in private sector jobs.

Unknown to many people, bananas have historical societal significance. Bananas have been known to help reduce the symptoms and pains of PMS in females. They are ripe when they are spotted brown- not when they are green or nearly fully brown. Their consumption can assist concentration and focus by healing some stress and keeping eyesight healthy. Banana peels can heal warts when the inner part of the peel is placed on the skin. They are a rich source of fiber and many other essential nutrients and vitamins. Presently there are various examples in the public realm that highlight the importance of bananas. Here are just a few of those examples: the children's show "Bananas in Pajamas," the banana slug as the mascot for the University of California at Santa Cruz, an online networking portal named "Broadband Bananas," and the Washington Banana Museum.

'''Globalization of Markets and Competition: Trade is increasingly global in scope today. There are several reasons for this. One significant reason is technological—because of improved transportation and communication opportunities today, trade is now more practical. Thus, consumers and businesses now have access to the very best products from many different countries. Increasingly rapid technology lifecycles also increases the competition among countries as to who can produce the newest in technology. In part to accommodate these realities, countries in the last several decades have taken increasing steps to promote global trade through agreements such as the General Treaty on Trade and Tariffs, and trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the European Union (EU).''Italic text'''''
