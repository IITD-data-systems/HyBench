Direct carbon conversion units could be used to generate electric power for the grid. Such a power plant would be "large, but not gigantic." Advanced combustion, fuel cells, nuclear and renewable energy, and conservation may all combine to help the situation in a way that cannot presently be predicted.It is vitally important to develop a simple fuel cell technology that greatly increases the yield of electric energy from each unit of fossil fuel, uses fuels derived efficiently from almost any fossil fuel, significantly decreases the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, and makes it easy to capture the carbon dioxide for sequestration or other use.Clearly, weâ€™re just beginning to hear about direct carbon conversion.
\\nInner Wisdom Foundation is a non-profit organization located in East Montpelier, Vermont that develops sustainable solutions to systemic problems surrounding education, healthcare, clean water, energy, and agriculture within developing communities in Central East Africa, and Central America. By providing real solutions to local challenges such as adequate healthcare facilities, dependable sources of energy (e.g. solar power, solar hot water, solar cooking), vocational schools, and sustainable agricultural practices, these communities are given the necessary tools to build and sustain strong, viable, local economies.
                                          Rocks And Minerals\\n\\nWhat are rocks?\\n\\nMaking up the majority of the Earth's crust, rock is usually defined as a mixture of common minerals. Rocks can be hard or soft, as small as a grain or as large as a building. They have been an integral part of the history of mankind, first being used as tools for hunting and defense, and as a building materials to construct shelters and monuments. Combined with the effects of tectonics, weathering and vegetation, rocks define the natural landscapes we see around us. The minerals and metals we find in rocks are essential to the prosperity and cultural splendor of human civilization. There are many kinds of rock, and they can be classified in a number of ways. However, geologists classify rocks based on how the rocks were formed. The three classes are igneous rocks (formed directly from liquid rock), metamorphic rocks (formed by direct alteration of existing rocks), and sedimentary rocks (formed by eroded materials from other rocks).
A home inspection provides homeowners with knowledge about the current condition of their home. This process is very important when buying and selling a house. The inspection will define any defects the house may have, such as roofing, foundation, plumbing, pest infestations, heating and cooling, insulation, walls and floors. All homes have problems, but how serious are they? Inspections provide the answer. The purpose of inspections is to keep the property as safe as possible, but also to define the homes retail value. Home inspections are preformed by professionals to help a seller sell their home to a buyer that values safety.    \\n\\n\\nSources: homeinspection.com\\n         ourfamilyplace.com
== Baby Proofing ==\\nA process which involves creating a safe place for babies and children to exist, play and live that will limit the exposure to potentially dangerous items, situations and conditions to prevent injury, damage and death. The process often includes the addition and use of devices to assist in the process. A home or space used for babies and children should be enhanced for their safety prior to the time they are able to crawl or become mobile. Common items that are utilized to increase safety include - stairwell gates, drawer and cabinet locks, electrical outlet protection, bathroom and toilet locks, stabilizng or anchoring furniture to prevent toppling, fire safety equipment and emergency planning tools.
Can you help translate this for me to swedish? Many thanks in advance!\\n\\n''The communist government allocated substantial resources to the development of agriculture. Large-scale programs of land reclamation, soil improvement, and irrigation, as well as increased use of fertilizers, all contributed to a significant expansion of agricultural production. Yet, despite impressive gains, agricultural production continues to be hindered by the persistence of traditional farming methods, low mechanization, and a lack of material incentives to encourage farmers to produce. This lasting legacy of the forced collectivization of agriculture and the abolition of private property has made it necessary to return land to the peasants and allow them to raise crops and livestock for private profit. The expansion of private agriculture is intended to pave the way for the introduction of new farming techniques and mechanization.''\\n\\n--[[User:Armour|Armour]] 14:27, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

Urban Photography is a popular form of photography documenting modern life within any populated geographic location. This form of photography tends to capture everyday life, seemingly from a first-hand account. It can be described as the combination of landscape and documentary photography. While documentary photography is very similar, urban photography generally does not capture a specific event or cause. Typical works of urban photography will feature city skylines, city-life, buildings, cars and people. This form of photography is especially popular among bloggers and amateur photographers.
I am a scientist at a university in the American Pacific Northwest studying structural and molecular parasitology.  I look for parasite genes that could be vulnerable to antiparasitic drugs and examine the structures of target parasite proteins for ways to make drugs more potent and less toxic to people.  My focus is to develop better treatments for Trypanosoma cruzi infection, the cause of Chagas disease, and related trypanosomatid Leishmania species.  Along with lab science, I have done advocacy and community building work on affordability of medicines to people living in poverty and development of new health technologies (drugs, diagnostics, vaccines) for neglected infections of poverty.
The World Institute of Sustainable Energy (WISE) is a not-for-profit institute set up in June 2004 to promote sustainable energy, energy conservation, and sustainable development. In particular, the institution is committed towards addressing the shortcomings existing in the sustainable energy sector in India, viz. lack of policy support and incentives, lack of legislative and research support, lack of qualified manpower, and lack of critical awareness that would lead to the transition to a sustainable energy-based economy. Since its inception, WISE has pioneered several initiatives for accelerating the development of sustainable energy in the country.
