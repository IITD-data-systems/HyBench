Africa Mission Alliance (AMA) is a faith-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Portland, Oregon with subsidiaries in East and Central Africa. The work of AMA began in the country of Rwanda in 2003 as a few individuals dedicated to caring for orphans, widows and the needy in this genocide ravaged country. AMA’s dream is to reach beyond Rwanda into all of Africa and see a new generation of Africans becoming change agents in their vulnerable communities. \\nThe mission of Africa Mission Alliance is to bring professional and general public resources together for the purposes of training, equipping, and supporting local communities in Africa to develop self-sustaining, community-based approaches to solving their problems.\\n\\nAMA believes that the people of Africa do not want to live on handouts. They need help to discover and use their own vision, skills, and resources to achieve self-sufficiency. Africa Mission Alliance is committed to walking and working with communities in Africa by empowering them to build sustainable communities. The larger vision is to address critical needs that hinder development by helping communities receive quality education, skills training, basic health care, access to clean water, and micro-finance loans
'''Psoriasis''' is an auto-immune disease with symptoms of red, itchy, scaly, and inflamed. Most suffers typically treat themselves with over-the-counter treatments and prescribed medications. Many negative side effects are attributed to the use of prescribed medications.\\n\\nFor years the herbal treatments for the reduction of psoriasis symptoms have been largely ignored by mainstream physicians. Many health food stores and alternative practitioners are embracing the use of herbs in their stores, practices, and suggestive selling.\\n\\nOne of the trend setters in this arena is a small company out of Tampa, FL., SielosRx. Their use of organic herbs in a cleansing and soothing regimen has caught the eye of local Dermatologist, Dr. Francis Caban. He sees people who have normally received limited results with traditional medications obtain surprising results within weeks of using nothing more than the organic herbs in these products.\\n\\nDr. Caban insists the results are genuine and has offered SielosRx to his clients when they are considering treatment options. He is firm in his belief that psoriasis suffers can choose how they reduce the symptoms of their disease. They no longer have to just suffer or take the medications that have potentially harmful side effects.
<blockquote>\\nThe Earth Sciences (also known as geoscience, the geosciences or Earth Science) is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth. It is a special type of planetary science; it studies the planet we live on: the structure and composition of the Earth, its origins, physical features, changing aspects, and all of its natural phenomena. The major disciplines of The Earth Sciences use physics, mathematics and, chemistry to build a quantitative understanding of the principal areas or spheres of the Earth system. Like in many sciences, The Earth can be studied both experimentally and theoretically. Also, there are both reductionist and holistic approaches to Earth Science. Applications of the Earth Sciences include the exploration and exploitation of mineral and hydrocarbon resources, cartography, weather forecasting patterns, and warning of volcanic eruptions. The Earth Sciences are related to the environmental sciences as well as the other subfields of planetary astronomy.\\n</blockquote>

The same instrumentation can be used to control quality and content of food and to analyze metabolites and nutritional biomarkers.\\n\\nWe do not eat the same bread or drink the same beer that our grandparents did hundred years ago. Agriculture and food technology have changed greatly and must be taken into account to evaluate the effect of these technologies on the nutritional value of food and its effect on human health.\\n\\nWe also have to consider the health effect of our life style; one of sitting in front of the computer, in a car or on an airplane. Our body evolved to produce chemicals to help us to survive but with an active lifestyle. The result is that, we now live in a new state of physiological stress.\\n\\nMeaningful food recommendations based on such understanding is limited. It is critical to understand what to eat and how these foods are metabolized and what molecules are produced in the human body as a reaction to stress.\\n\\nIt is the goal of INDC to bring together an understanding of the food we eat with the analytical techniques needed to study them.\\n\\nINDC2012 will be held at Carolinum, Charles University in Prague, August 27-30, 2012.\\n\\nReferences:http://www.indc.cz/en/
\\n'''Reasons For Unemployment in Kerala'''\\n\\nIt is interesting to know that the State with the highest literacy rate — almost 97 per cent — has the highest unemployment rate when compared to others. Kerala is known for large-scale migration of skilled labour to other States and countries. \\n\\nA few millions of people of the State have been working outside it for many years. Had they remained in Kerala, the unemployment rate would have been much higher than what was quoted in the article. \\n\\nWhat ails the State that has such a high literacy rate and is also blessed by vast natural resources? \\n\\nDoes the education system make people lethargic or rights-conscious or inefficient or unenterprising to start productive activities for their own progress? Does the education system make people more destructive in nature? \\n\\nNo industrialist wants to set up any industry in Kerala due to labour problems. The State is bankrupt, besides being corrupt and largely politicised. Trade unionism is still alive in Kerala. West Bengal was industrially ruined by the same attitude of the workers despite a highly skilled labour force. \\n\\nInstead of migrating to other States for jobs, Keralites should use their knowledge and expertise in establishing new productive activity on their own. Many of them should look at self-employment for overcoming the serious problem of unemployment.
'''PRANAV'''\\nThe Changing Nature Of Festivals – Fun Or Rituals? \\nPeople from different religions and regions all over India celebrate a number of festivals – religious, cultural and social. The celebrations of such festivals help people come together, shed their egos and the consciousness of individual identities and results in integration. Man is a social animal. He has formed a society and has maintained his own culture. Culture clubs together religion, territorial necessities and requirements of nature and civilisation. The essence of culture can be seen in many festivals. Festivals celebrated all over India follow different regional traditions. Common festivals celebrated in India are Raksha-Bandhan, Navratri, Rangpanchami, Ganesh Utsav etc.In recent years there has been some criticism about the supposedly excessive use of firecrackers, especially during the Hindu festival of Deepavali. The most commonly cited reason is the noise pollution caused by firecrackers.The noise from firecrackers has a more deleterious effect on animals who have a more sensitive sense of hearing than humans. Pets such as dogs and cats, as well as stray cattle in and around cities are most affected. Voluntary and non-profit organizations such as People for Animals educate the public about these issues.Another criticism is that smog caused by firecrackers may be harmful to inhale and can cause difficulty for drivers because of reduced visibility. The usage of "rockets" near apartment buildings has also given rise to many injuries. No law prohibiting this has been passed.
12forests, was founded in Chicago, IL, in 2008. The focus of the organization is  to help the world end exploitation and its causes. It uses proven vedic and yogic methodologies, to distribute karma free vegetarian food, educate and develop sustainable villages. Its outlook is always wide, focusing on how the world views the environment and all living beings.  Understanding the importance of clean and safe environment it introduces everyone to proven strategies of simple development based on cows and land.  12forests which comes from an extensive research background on the importance of cows, as seen in ayurveda and yoga.  The dung and urine of the cow provides for an antiseptic environment which would help third world countries counteract the threats of unsanitary conditions.  Also, it helps to set aside petroleum based and human feces fertilizers as used in the USA and Mexico.  These fertilizers have caused countless deaths in the form of e.coli and cancers, and not to speak of destroying water supplies.  So based on the highest scientific models 12forests is helping poverty stricken children, families and the environment from forced degradation.\\n<ref>12forests.org</ref>
In Alaska, the significant variation in both climate and population make standard architectural applications impractical. The summer months in Alaska draw in more than half of the yearly income for the state due to the increase in construction, commercial fishing, logging and mining, and the tourism industry.  In some regions, including southeastern Alaska, the population fluctuates as much as two thirds from January to July.  This irregularity creates a huge strain on the city especially in the realm of housing.  The majority of the seasonal population is currently expected to live in modular housing units fabricated to withstand less than three years, demanding an unbelievable amount of government funds that could be used elsewhere for city development.  Not only is this economically and environmentally unsound, but it provides only the bare necessities for this population.  This is why a seasonal housing facility is pivotal to the success of the state as a whole and specifically to those cities with a large seasonal population.  The large variation in population between the summer and winter months has created a need for housing types that can “hibernate” seasonally to reduce the amount of necessary energy and maintenance. Not only would this produce a more suitable and environmentally conscious method of housing the seasonal population, but also increase the possibility of permanent residence through an increase in the quality of life.  Although the application of seasonal buildings would be beneficial to most cities in the state of Alaska because of the migration patterns of the seasonal populations, the city of Juneau is particularly affected.  This city, the state’s capital, looses almost one third of its population in this seasonal shift, and yet has maintained a significant role in the economic success of the state.   However, Juneau suffers from housing shortages, urban sprawl and unfavorable living conditions.  This is why the application of a fluctuating, multifamily housing facility would accommodate the seasonal population, densify the current population, and employ environmentally responsive technology to help reduce the overall cost of living.  The success of the proposed building type would change the face of Alaskan housing and address the housing crisis that has for so long gone unaddressed. \\n  The underdevelopment of Alaska is often attributed to the unusual conditions of its latitude including dramatic variation in sunlight hours and harsh weather conditions.  However, this argument is undermined when compared to other cities at the same 60oN Latitude.  Glasgow, Scotland, St. Petersburg, Russia, and Stockholm, Sweden are all located within 5 degrees of the latitude of Juneau Alaska, and all are very established ranging in population from .5-5 million.  In addition, these cities are all major contributor to the overall GDP of their respective countries. The city layouts demonstrate the success of the area with the densely build scheme.  The feature of these cities that is not shared by Juneau is the topography.  All of these cities have a very flat landscape making development much less difficult and also ease in the circulation through and into the region.  It can then be concluded that in Alaska the topographical challenge is more detrimental to the development of the state than the cold climate. \\nThe land area of Alaska is 656425 square miles making it account for almost 20% of the total land area of the United States.  It is by far the largest state at more than 60% the size of Texas, 75% the size of California, and 93% larger than Pennsylvania, and yet is one of the most underdeveloped and underutilized areas in the nation.   The land features significant natural resources and the largest amount of coast line out of any other state in the United States.  \\n\\nThe average population of the United States falls just above 304 million.  The average population per state is just above 6 million, and yet the largest state, that which encompasses almost 1/5 of the United States territory has only 626, 932 inhabitants, almost half of the population of Rhode Island.  These numbers are even more significant when one compares the population density of various states.  Alaska with its vast lands and miniscule population is by far the least dense, having an average of only 1.2 residents per square mile. \\nThe states chosen for comparison have a wide variety of geographic and climatic aspects which shows the diversity of population density over the nation, but none even comes close to the discrepancy between these numbers and those exhibited in the region of Alaska.  It is also strange that Alaska’s proximity to the Pacific Northwest, the religion currently experiencing the largest national population growth, has not more directly affected the influx into this adjacent territory.\\n	The economic trends in the United States have a very significant impact on the economy of Alaska.  The trend over the last 30 years has consistently demonstrated this relationship.  During times of economic turmoil in the US, namely recessions, the migration to Alaska increases drastically.  This is largely due to the more stable job market in Alaska, one that operates more independently from other states in the nation.  The lower chart shows the average state GDP vs. various state’s GDP.   The GDP of Alaska is above the US average.  This should result in a higher population due to a more stable economy, as is the trend in the United States, yet the result is inconsistent in Alaska. \\nThe city of Juneau offers a variety of locations that would benefit from the establishment of a large scale housing facility.  This is largely due to the fact that housing development is currently sprawling into the outskirts of the city lines because of cheap and more buildable land.  This has expanded the city limits, but not the density or even overall population.  In addition to sprawl, in the last 30 years the center of Juneau has shifted from the historic downtown area to the land surround the airport.  Unfortunately this diversion has left the downtown in disrepair.  The migration has occurred because the land surround the downtown area is more difficult to build upon, making construction of single family homes more expensive, and because of the significance of the Juneau Airport as a primary gateway into the state of Alaska.  The city is essentially being split in half socially and industrially.  Reorganizing the city development of the city to focus on the historical downtown area would help preserve the city as a destination and not merely a transit hub.  Locating a housing facility in this area would help facilitate this effort, making it more affordable to establish residence.  It would also reduce the need for public transportation because the majority of employment, especially tourism and government based professions, occurs in this section of the city. \\nThe intended program to be developed on this site is a large scale housing facility.  This facility will cater to a variety of people with different needs throughout the city of Juneau.  The core of the facility will be made up of two and three bedroom units that correspond with the current housing market demand in the area.  In addition to these standard units, a portion of the development will be dedicated to affordable housing units to accommodate the portion of the population that is below the poverty line, including a large portion of the native population in and around Juneau.  In addition, a portion of the units will be seasonally adjustable creating a facility that can fluctuate either physically or systematically to accommodate the seasonal population influx.   This portion of the structure will not merely be cut off from the establishment when not in use, but like the city, will change in use to enhance the facility for the permanent residents.  The establishment of a stable and changing population could be a mutually advantageous relationship. The permanent residents help reduce the maintenance and upkeep to the temporary facilities during the off season and in turn receive a portion of the profit from the seasonal residents.  This relationship would change the dynamic between the two groups are result in a more community centered organization.  In addition to housing units, the facility will include amenities that not only increase its desirability for both temporary and permanent residents, but also work to draw in the surrounding community and population of downtown Juneau.  These amenities will be defined and located in a way to ensure security for the residents while still increasing public circulation to and through the building.  The facility will also be developed in a way that is environmentally sensitive in design and perception.  It will capitalize on the aesthetically unique features of the context and utilize the favorable site conditions to become more self sustaining.  The development of a successful housing system will increase the density in downtown Juneau and provide the citizens with a more habitable and experientially significant living experience.\\n<ref>http://ruralhealth.hrsa.gov/pub/seasonalpopulation.asp#Case1.

What are Prayer Wheels?\\n\\n   Prayer wheels contain the words of the Buddha: teachings of wisdom and compassion. While the Buddha's discourses fill many volumes, they may also be condensed into syllables with deep symbolic meaning known as mantra. Tibetans recite these profound and inspiring texts to instill them in memory and promote the well­being of others. \\n\\n   The Tibetan term "dharma wheel" has been rendered into English as "prayer wheel". Yet prayer wheels are much more than supplicants to a higher spirit. They can contain the full potency and meaning of the path to enlightenment.\\n\\n   Believing that turning dharma wheels filled with these texts and symbols is equivalent to reciting them, Tibetans place dharma wheels in monasteries, temples, and libraries and turn them at every opportunity to convey the blessings of compassion and harmony, prevent natural disasters, and promote peace in the world. Although dharma wheels were known in ancient India and Nepal, only in Tibet did they become an integral part of daily life. Today as in ages past, the dharma wheels are honored as symbols of enlightened knowledge, able to evoke the healing powers of the mind and increase its capacities for wisdom.\\n\\n   In recent years, the world has seen how quickly knowledge-even when valued and protected by an entire culture-can be brought to the brink of extinction. In response, we have made great efforts to preserve the cultural heritage of Tibet, including the intricate science of dharma wheels, which are in themselves ways of preserving and disseminating the benefits of enlightened knowledge. Having created more than a thousand 4 foot high wheels for our own organization and donated 100,000 of the hand-held wheels to individuals in the Himalayan region, we have come to share the view that dharma wheels have a calming and healing influence on the environment and human beings, qualities greatly needed in our world today.
Timber framed boat docks are toxic playgrounds.  In 2001, the EPA banned \\narsenic treated wood from our children’s playgrounds because of the deadly \\nhazards of exposure.  Yet, treated timbers are still being used to build boat \\ndocks in many areas throughout the country.  These timbers continuer to leach \\ndeadly toxins year after year.\\n\\nPressure-treated boards and timbers are leaking poisonous arsenic into our \\nsoil and waterways.  The arsenic comes from 'chromated copper arsenate', CCA, \\nan infusion of pesticides, fungicides, and preservatives to delay the natural \\ndecaying process of wood.  These known carcinogens, have been linked to many \\ncancers, poisonings, severe skin rashes, and many other health issues.\\n\\nCCA treated wood, a very common boat dock building material, exposes us to \\nunnecessary danger when we are most vulnerable.  Barely clothed, barefoot, and \\nwet the very waters around these docks continually wash the treated surfaces \\nwhere we play.  All reports and handling guidelines suggest we were gloves, \\nglasses, and long sleeve shirts when handling CCA treated wood.  Yet, once in \\nplace as our waterfront play ground, we can't expect our children to go \\nswimming with so much protection.\\n\\nMore than 30 million pounds of pure arsenic comes  into the U.S. each year. \\nMuch of this is used in treating wood and timbers that will be used in dock \\nconstruction. Ultimately, the vast majority of this will end up in local \\nlandfills where it can leach into soil and local waterways.\\n[[User:Saveourwaters|Saveourwaters]] ([[User talk:Saveourwaters|talk]]) 00:03, 4 June 2008 (UTC)Lin Rimple
