The results indicate that trauma is caused by the consequence of young people becoming homeless, and the lives of these men and women should be understood. Other causes for homelessness are issues from people living in poverty, lack of employment, houses being too expensive, gentrification and violence. All of these reasons is why people are now becoming homeless at young ages. \\n\\nYoung children are becoming homeless as well. There are major risks for homeless children, such as poor health care, not having a good well-being and having bad social outcomes. These children are exposed to a very stressful life style, they witness a lot of domestic violence, mental health difficulties and most likely to come from a broken home. In about every 200 children in America, 3 will become homeless today and more then double of that will be at risk for homelessness. School is impacted by homelessness, because of residency requirements, guardianship requirements, delays in transfer of school credits, use of transportation and lack of health resources. Even the children who still attend school that are homeless, have a low attendance record.\\n\\nThere have been alliances that organizations have created to end homelessness. There are studies and estimations that have been made to figure out how many individuals today are homeless. There are strategies that are listed about how to end it and ways to gain more knowledge on the topic as well.
EDUCATION IN COSTA RICA.\\n\\nIn what used to be a poverty-stricken rural backwater, it is understandable that the country's high standards of schooling are a source of enormous national pride. With foregone military budgets funding the massive education system, the only armies these days are hordes of neatly-uniformed schoolchildren on their way to and from school-one of the most ubiquitous images of Costa Rica.\\n\\nEducation is seen as the means to income (salaries are determined by academic level)and status-everyone wants to be cultured. As nearly every job, however menial, requires a high-school education, many adults study at evening classes or through distance learning, choosing from the huge array of courses available.\\n\\nWhile the level of education in Costa Rica is clearly high for the region, and one of the reasons why the country is so popular with foreign business investors in Costa Rica real estate, it seems that a good education is increasingly becoming an issue of wealth.
Africa Mission Alliance (AMA) is a faith-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Portland, Oregon with subsidiaries in East and Central Africa. The work of AMA began in the country of Rwanda in 2003 as a few individuals dedicated to caring for orphans, widows and the needy in this genocide ravaged country. AMA’s dream is to reach beyond Rwanda into all of Africa and see a new generation of Africans becoming change agents in their vulnerable communities. \\nThe mission of Africa Mission Alliance is to bring professional and general public resources together for the purposes of training, equipping, and supporting local communities in Africa to develop self-sustaining, community-based approaches to solving their problems.\\n\\nAMA believes that the people of Africa do not want to live on handouts. They need help to discover and use their own vision, skills, and resources to achieve self-sufficiency. Africa Mission Alliance is committed to walking and working with communities in Africa by empowering them to build sustainable communities. The larger vision is to address critical needs that hinder development by helping communities receive quality education, skills training, basic health care, access to clean water, and micro-finance loans
'''Psoriasis''' is an auto-immune disease with symptoms of red, itchy, scaly, and inflamed. Most suffers typically treat themselves with over-the-counter treatments and prescribed medications. Many negative side effects are attributed to the use of prescribed medications.\\n\\nFor years the herbal treatments for the reduction of psoriasis symptoms have been largely ignored by mainstream physicians. Many health food stores and alternative practitioners are embracing the use of herbs in their stores, practices, and suggestive selling.\\n\\nOne of the trend setters in this arena is a small company out of Tampa, FL., SielosRx. Their use of organic herbs in a cleansing and soothing regimen has caught the eye of local Dermatologist, Dr. Francis Caban. He sees people who have normally received limited results with traditional medications obtain surprising results within weeks of using nothing more than the organic herbs in these products.\\n\\nDr. Caban insists the results are genuine and has offered SielosRx to his clients when they are considering treatment options. He is firm in his belief that psoriasis suffers can choose how they reduce the symptoms of their disease. They no longer have to just suffer or take the medications that have potentially harmful side effects.
Is the Kyoto Protocol heading toward (or does it already contain) provisions for emissions trading or a [[cap and trade]] program?\\n\\nWill nations such as India and China which won't be bound by the protocol, nevertheless participate in a trading program? That is, will they get tens of billions of dollars from the industrialized West (US and Europe) simply for doing nothing?\\n\\nIf global warming is caused by sunspots more than carbon dioxide, and the average atmosphure temperatures levels off at 1.0C to 1.5C higher than the 2000 level, won't the whole thing have amounted to nothing more than an international welfare program for countries with anti-free-market economic policies?\\n\\nI worry about this sort of thing, you know.\\n\\n[[user:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]], Wednesday, June 12, 2002
I'm an Astronomy Masters student with a particular interest in terraforming and space colonisation. I wholeheartedly believe that there's an urgent need to solve humanity's problems by making clear advancements in space discovery and colonisation. We need, now more than ever, to start thinking in bigger terms and move on from our earth-bound, earth-centric view. With thousands of years of progress already under our belts, now's the time to step up and take ourselves to the next level. Creative solutions to pressing problems are urgently required! Advancements will only come from more research and hence from greater funding. And that will only come about if there is a groundswell of understanding and support significant enough to shift the political and economic agenda.
\\n'''Reasons For Unemployment in Kerala'''\\n\\nIt is interesting to know that the State with the highest literacy rate — almost 97 per cent — has the highest unemployment rate when compared to others. Kerala is known for large-scale migration of skilled labour to other States and countries. \\n\\nA few millions of people of the State have been working outside it for many years. Had they remained in Kerala, the unemployment rate would have been much higher than what was quoted in the article. \\n\\nWhat ails the State that has such a high literacy rate and is also blessed by vast natural resources? \\n\\nDoes the education system make people lethargic or rights-conscious or inefficient or unenterprising to start productive activities for their own progress? Does the education system make people more destructive in nature? \\n\\nNo industrialist wants to set up any industry in Kerala due to labour problems. The State is bankrupt, besides being corrupt and largely politicised. Trade unionism is still alive in Kerala. West Bengal was industrially ruined by the same attitude of the workers despite a highly skilled labour force. \\n\\nInstead of migrating to other States for jobs, Keralites should use their knowledge and expertise in establishing new productive activity on their own. Many of them should look at self-employment for overcoming the serious problem of unemployment.

The same instrumentation can be used to control quality and content of food and to analyze metabolites and nutritional biomarkers.\\n\\nWe do not eat the same bread or drink the same beer that our grandparents did hundred years ago. Agriculture and food technology have changed greatly and must be taken into account to evaluate the effect of these technologies on the nutritional value of food and its effect on human health.\\n\\nWe also have to consider the health effect of our life style; one of sitting in front of the computer, in a car or on an airplane. Our body evolved to produce chemicals to help us to survive but with an active lifestyle. The result is that, we now live in a new state of physiological stress.\\n\\nMeaningful food recommendations based on such understanding is limited. It is critical to understand what to eat and how these foods are metabolized and what molecules are produced in the human body as a reaction to stress.\\n\\nIt is the goal of INDC to bring together an understanding of the food we eat with the analytical techniques needed to study them.\\n\\nINDC2012 will be held at Carolinum, Charles University in Prague, August 27-30, 2012.\\n\\nReferences:http://www.indc.cz/en/
'''PRANAV'''\\nThe Changing Nature Of Festivals – Fun Or Rituals? \\nPeople from different religions and regions all over India celebrate a number of festivals – religious, cultural and social. The celebrations of such festivals help people come together, shed their egos and the consciousness of individual identities and results in integration. Man is a social animal. He has formed a society and has maintained his own culture. Culture clubs together religion, territorial necessities and requirements of nature and civilisation. The essence of culture can be seen in many festivals. Festivals celebrated all over India follow different regional traditions. Common festivals celebrated in India are Raksha-Bandhan, Navratri, Rangpanchami, Ganesh Utsav etc.In recent years there has been some criticism about the supposedly excessive use of firecrackers, especially during the Hindu festival of Deepavali. The most commonly cited reason is the noise pollution caused by firecrackers.The noise from firecrackers has a more deleterious effect on animals who have a more sensitive sense of hearing than humans. Pets such as dogs and cats, as well as stray cattle in and around cities are most affected. Voluntary and non-profit organizations such as People for Animals educate the public about these issues.Another criticism is that smog caused by firecrackers may be harmful to inhale and can cause difficulty for drivers because of reduced visibility. The usage of "rockets" near apartment buildings has also given rise to many injuries. No law prohibiting this has been passed.
contingency plan\\n\\nA contingency plan is a plan devised for an exceptional risk that, though unlikely, would have catastrophic consequences. Contingency plans are often devised by governments or businesses. For example, suppose many employees of a company are traveling together on an aircraft which crashes, killing all aboard. The company could be severely strained or even ruined by such a loss. Accordingly, many companies have procedures to follow in the event of such a disaster. The plan may also include standing policies to mitigate a disaster's potential impact, such as requiring employees to travel separately or limiting the number of employees on any one aircraft.\\n\\nDuring times of crisis, contingency plans are often developed to explore and prepare for any eventualit
