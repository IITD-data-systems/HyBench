We envision a resilient and independently sustainable Prince Rupert, capable of providing for itself comfortably through both times of economic boom or bust. A community where food and energy are produced locally, where waste is reduced and reclaimed for productive use. A community that values the unique contributions and skills of its citizens, where human development is a top priority and using less fossil fuels results in greater overall community well-being. We dare to dream of a Prince Rupert where imagination, creativity, fun and play unlock the collective genius within our community.
