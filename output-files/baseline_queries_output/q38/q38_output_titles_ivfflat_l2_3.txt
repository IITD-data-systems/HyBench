{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n\\n==Public space notes==\\nOwnership of public space can confuse the perception of what is public space and what is accessible by the public. The general assumption is that government owned external land is public space but with several exceptions such as military sites or government buildings that do not have a public function (such as the gardens of the White House or the lawns of the Pentagon). Space owned by private organisations such as churches, corporations or charities can offer public access to their space, but with rules that do not apply to state owned public space. graveyards, National Trust coast line and art galleries blur this distinction of not always being state owned, but can be treated in many respects as Public Space.\\n\\nThe time of day can also change the way Public Space may be used. At 12 noon, office workers may be encouraged to use an office plaza for lunchtime, but at 12 midnight, loitering may not at all be acceptable.
