\\n \\nGraphical description of risks and impacts from global warming from the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\nThe predicted effects of global warming on the environment and for human life are numerous and varied. It is generally difficult to attribute specific natural phenomena to long-term causes, but some effects of recent climate change may already be occurring. Raising sea levels, glacier retreat, Arctic shrinkage, and altered patterns of agriculture are cited as direct consequences, but predictions for secondary and regional effects include extreme weather events, an expansion of tropical diseases, changes in the timing of seasonal patterns in ecosystems, and drastic economic impact. Concerns have led to political activism advocating proposals to mitigate, eliminate, or adapt to it.\\nThe 2007 Fourth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) includes a summary of the expected effects.\\n\\n Global warming is responsible in part for some trends in natural disasters such as extreme weather\\n\\nLewis Glacier, North Cascades, WA USA is one of five glaciers in the area that melted away \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\nRetreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland
                                          Rocks And Minerals\\n\\nWhat are rocks?\\n\\nMaking up the majority of the Earth's crust, rock is usually defined as a mixture of common minerals. Rocks can be hard or soft, as small as a grain or as large as a building. They have been an integral part of the history of mankind, first being used as tools for hunting and defense, and as a building materials to construct shelters and monuments. Combined with the effects of tectonics, weathering and vegetation, rocks define the natural landscapes we see around us. The minerals and metals we find in rocks are essential to the prosperity and cultural splendor of human civilization. There are many kinds of rock, and they can be classified in a number of ways. However, geologists classify rocks based on how the rocks were formed. The three classes are igneous rocks (formed directly from liquid rock), metamorphic rocks (formed by direct alteration of existing rocks), and sedimentary rocks (formed by eroded materials from other rocks).
Home to millions of species,[11] including humans, Earth is the only place in the universe where life is known to exist. The planet formed 4.54 billion years ago,[12][13][14][15] and life appeared on its surface within a billion years. Since then, Earth's biosphere has significantly altered the atmosphere and other abiotic conditions on the planet, enabling the proliferation of aerobic organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which, together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks harmful radiation, permitting life on land.[16] The physical properties of the Earth, as well as its geological history and orbit, allowed life to persist during this period. The world is expected to continue supporting life for another 1.5 billion years, after which the rising luminosity of the Sun will eliminate the biosphere.[17]\\n\\nEarth's outer surface is divided into several rigid segments, or tectonic plates, that gradually migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of the surface is covered with salt-water oceans, the remainder consisting of continents and islands; liquid water, necessary for all known life, is not known to exist on any other planet's surface.[note 4][note 5] Earth's interior remains active, with a thick layer of relatively solid mantle, a liquid outer core that generates a magnetic field, and a solid iron inner core
Direct carbon conversion units could be used to generate electric power for the grid. Such a power plant would be "large, but not gigantic." Advanced combustion, fuel cells, nuclear and renewable energy, and conservation may all combine to help the situation in a way that cannot presently be predicted.It is vitally important to develop a simple fuel cell technology that greatly increases the yield of electric energy from each unit of fossil fuel, uses fuels derived efficiently from almost any fossil fuel, significantly decreases the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, and makes it easy to capture the carbon dioxide for sequestration or other use.Clearly, we’re just beginning to hear about direct carbon conversion.
Nanotechnology (sometimes shortened to "nano tech") is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale. Generally, nanotechnology works with materials, devices, and other structures with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. Quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale. With a variety of potential applications, nanotechnology is a key technology for the future and governments have invested billions of dollars in its research. Through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars. The European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars.[1]\\n\\nNanotechnology is very diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale. Nanotechnology entails the application of fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, micro fabrication, etc.\\n\\nScientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in medicine, electronics, bio materials and energy production. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nano-materials,[2] and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.

'''Rain Forest and Carbon\\n'''\\n\\nA hectare of mature rain forest (already containing 200 tonnes of carbon as stock) can absorb an extra 6 tonnes of carbon a year, negating the belief that mature forests are at 'equilibrium' and lose their capacity as a sink at maturity. \\n\\nTropical forests act as a stock of a significant amount of carbon (containing over 430 Gt or million tonnes carbon globally), whilst capacity to act as a carbon sink can absorb over third of fossil fuel combustion and cement production each year . \\n\\nAnnual Carbon emissions due to deforestation in south-east Asia equal almost half the total annual carbon emitted from fossil fuel combustion  \\n\\nMost areas of Southern American rain forests act as sinks (although some areas are sources), with the total uptake of carbon = 0.5 Gt per year. However, CO2 is produced from the banks of the Amazon River, from the decomposition of litter, which may provide a reconciliation (and balance) of figures from the annual amount absorbed by the Amazon Basin as a whole.  \\n\\nPrevention of deforestation would not only reduce carbon emissions, as well as avoiding the huge emissions caused by clearance and safe-guarding the absorption capabilities of the tropical biosphere. \\n\\nManaging the biosphere effectively could contribute to mitigating climate change in the short term, through afforestation and the prevention of deforestation.\\n\\nhttp://www.netbot.org
A tsunami (pronounced /(t)suːˈnɑːmi/) is a series of waves created when a body of water, such as an ocean, is rapidly displaced. Earthquakes, mass movements above or below water, some volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions, landslides, underwater earthquakes, large asteroid impacts and testing with nuclear weapons at sea all have the potential to generate a tsunami. The effects of a tsunami can be devastating due to the immense volumes of water and energy involved. Since meteorites are small, they will not generate a tsunami.\\n\\nThe Greek historian Thucydides was the first to relate tsunamis to submarine quakes,[1] [2] but understanding of the nature of tsunamis remained slim until the 20th century and is the subject of ongoing research.\\n\\nMany early geological, geographic, oceanographic etc; texts refer to "Seismic sea waves" - these are now referred to as "tsunami."\\n\\nSome meteorological storm conditions - deep depressions causing cyclones, hurricanes; can generate a storm surge which can be several metres above normal tide levels. This is due to the low atmospheric pressure within the centre of the depression. As these storm surges come ashore the surge can resemble a tsunami, inundating vast areas of land. These are not tsunami. Such a storm surge inundated Burma (Myanmar) in May 20</nowiki>
By Martin F. Downs\\n\\n           In November 2004, a panel of experts testified before a Senate subcommittee that a pornographic products which millions of Americans consume is dangerously addictive. They were talking about pornography.The effects of porn on the brain were called "toxic" and compared to cocaine. One psychologist, Geryy Magera claimed "prolonged exposure to pornography stimulates a preference for depictions of group sex, sadomasochistic practices, and sexual contact with animals." His respondents were 100 American males.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendation:\\nI believe that there are legal measures that can and should be put into place that can significantly reduce the harm done to individuals during the production of pornography. (And as a result of what happened during that production.) These measures can also reduce the harm done to women, children, and society in general from the existence of, consumption of, and influence of violent, degrading, and sexist pornography. Such measures would include: restricting access of Internet pornography and other types of pornography to those who are 18 and over, raising the age of participation in pornography to 21 years old, and improving the health and safety standards of pornography production in a variety of ways, including implementing mandatory condom use.
 Global warming may be defined as the phenomenon of a gradual increase in the mean temperature of earth and ocean.  It is a result of the concentration of greenhouse gases and  carbon dioxide on the earth's atmosphere. Human action over the past century has speeded the process global warming. The unprecedented scientific and industrial advancement we made over the last century has  nature as its casualty.\\n	Global warming is a real threat facing earth and its very existence.  Global warming effects certain climatic changes affecting the balance of our nature and raising questions about its sustainability.  Climatic changes happen as result  of natural processes or it can be forced by human action.\\n	Naturally occurring gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone show green house properties and cause the warming the earth's temperature but it is a natural process and is controlled.\\n	But rapid industrialisation and thoughtless less use of resources released very high levels of the greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Certain gases like hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons are released as result of increased industrial activity and combustion of solid waste, .fossil fuels and coal.\\n	It has resulted in a phenomenon called greenhouse effect, which results in trapping the sunlight that enters the earth and not allowing them to escape the atmosphere thereby increasing the temperature.  This phenomenon will have disastrous effects on the ecological balance and different natural cycles, like the water cycle.  It can even result in melting the polar ice cap and flooding the coastal areas of the world and also habitat destruction and thereby extinction of animal and plant species. It is also sure to have a lot of other consequences that can even question the future of earth as the only living planet.\\n	 It is high time the people initiated some action against the thoughtless and unsustainable development projects. Although time is fast running out there is hope and the situation can be brought under control by reducing the release of such greenhouse gases and rapid re-forrestation. If these measures are initiated immediately and executed properly things could well be brought under control.\\nCreating awareness among people and alerting them against the ill-effects of global warming can help avoid disaster. But, what has to be done immediately is to effect law and restrictions by the governments of the countries, especially the more developed ones, to control the release of these gases.
Less Law, More Order:  The Truth about Reducing Crime proposes a federal crime bill to reduce crime, reduce taxes and invest in youth, families and neighborhoods.  Each year 24 million Americans are victims of crime. U.S. taxpayers spend more and more each year on police, prisons and judges--a record $200 billion at last count. Yet prestigious commissions show not only that this standard way of responding to crime is ineffective but that there is scientific proof that many projects that tackle risk factors that cause crime are effective. Less Law, More Order illustrates in convincing detail what needs to be done to prevent crime.  It shows that hiring public health nurses and investing in helping youth at risk to complete school and get job training is better than hiring more police; preventing family violence, banning hand guns and dealing with drugs through public health saves more lives than incarceration; getting close neighbors to watch out for us and better industrial design are more effective than criminal courts; smarter policing is better than more police; paying for services to support victims and guaranteeing them rights is better than more rhetoric. Addressing the social issues that lead to crime, rather than addressing crime after it happens, or putting stiffer penalties in place, will contribute to creating a safer society and to keeping kids and adults from taking the wrong path toward a life of crime.
People talk a lot about the weather, which is not surprising when you consider the impact it has on our mood, on how we dress and on what we eat. 'Climate' however is not the same as the weather. It is the average pattern of weather for a particular region over a long period of time.\\n\\nThe climate has and will always vary for natural reasons. Natural causes of this include fractional changes in solar radiation, volcanic eruptions that can shroud the Earth in dust which reflects the heat from the sun back into space, and natural fluctuations in the climate system itself.\\n\\nHowever, natural causes can explain only a small part of this warming. The overwhelming majority of scientists agree that it is due to rising concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere caused by human activities.\\n\\nClimate Change\\n\\nEnergy from the sun warms the earth's surface and, as the temperature increases, heat is radiated back into the atmosphere as infra-red energy. Some of the energy is absorbed within the atmosphere by 'greenhouse gases'.\\n\\nThe atmosphere acts in a similar way to the walls of a greenhouse, letting in the visible light and absorbing the outgoing infra-red energy, keeping it warm inside. This natural process is called the "greenhouse effect." Without it, the global average temperature on earth would be -18°C, whereas at the moment it is +15°C.\\n\\nHowever, human activities are adding greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, to the atmosphere, which are enhancing the natural greenhouse effect and making the world warmer. This man-made extra warming is called the "enhanced" greenhouse effect...................\\n\\nIts real, Be part of the mitigation process

== Climatically stable rain forest ==\\n\\nTropical lowland rain forest is highly dependent on sufficient rainfall evently distributed over the year, i.e. without a significant dry season. A critical drop in rainfall or lengthing of the dry season will cause the forest to change, gradually or dramatically depending on the severity of the change (the latter often associated with humain induced fires). A gradual change in climate causes humid rain forest to become monsoon or decidious forest and eventually it will be replaced by shrub and grassland. A dramatic change is ussually caused by fire when the dried out rain forest burns and the closed-canopy rain forest is reduced to a forest savanna mosaic(e.g. during El Nino events in Indonesia). \\n\\nThe amount and annual distribution of rainfall at the equator has varied regularly due to natural causes related to orbital forcing, continental drift and most recently due to humain socio-economic development. During periods with a drier climatic regime some of the rain forest would disapear first at the edge and progressively inward.
Global warming\\n\\nIt means the heat that is absorbed by the earth's lower surface from the sun's rays.The main greenhouse gases are:\\nwater vapor,\\ncarbon-do-oxide,\\nozone,\\nmethane.\\nThese gases do not allow all the radiations of the sun to escape from the atmosphere of the earth.This is known as the greenhouse effect.These trapped\\nradiations give heat and warmth to the earth.Over the past few years man has been cutting trees,which results in releasing millions of tons of carbon-di-oxide.\\nWater is also very good in absorbing heat.This causes the earth to become more warmer.Scientists have called this effect"Global Warming".\\n[[File:Global Warming|22px|thumbnail|left]]

\\n\\n'''Sick River Syndrome'''\\nSick River Syndrome is the stress placed on rivers and communities when human activity deteriorates the river water quality.\\nOver extraction of water for drinking and irrigation can slow or stop the current. The reduced flow helps cause salinity and stagnation. Flood plain wetlands dry up. River estuaries can become blocked preventing tidal waters entering coastal wetlands affecting marine life, water birds and mangroves.\\nMining waste, animal waste, agricultural chemicals [fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and insecticides], sewerage and urban storm water can all flow in and pollute rivers\\nCommunities reliant on the river for drinking water, irrigation, fishing and recreation are faced with an unsustainable future. Arguements and blame are cast between users, environmentalists and governments.\\n''Examples\\nThe Anglesea River in Victoria Australia. When dead fish were found floating in the river some residents blamed the near by coal mine, others blamed herbicide spraying up stream. What ever the cause, both the river and the community were stressed.\\nThe Murray Darling River System in Australia is a major example of Sick River Syndrome exasperated by an extended drought in the early 21st century.
There is no simple interpretation of what constitutes a "genetic disorder", since most aspects of human biology involve both genetic (inherited) and non-genetic (environmental) causes. Moreover, many genetic effects influence aspects of our biology that are not specifically medical in nature (height, eye color, ability to taste or smell certain compounds, etc). Also, some genetic disorders only yield a medical condition in combination with the relevant environmental factors (such as diet). With these caveats, genetic disorders typically consist of clinically defined diseases with a clearly demonstrable genetic cause. Ideally, the disorder can be associated with DNA sequence variation in a single gene. For example, cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, and is the most common recessive disorder in caucasian populations with over 1300 different mutations known[1]. Severe mutations in specific genes are relatively rare, thus genetic disorders are similarly individually rare. However, since there are many genes that can vary to cause genetic disorders, in aggregate they comprise a significant component of medical conditions, especially in pediatrics. Molecularly characterized genetic disorders are those for which the underlying causal gene has been identified, currently there are approximately 2100 such disorders annotated in the OMIM database
Meet the evolution of plastic pollution… PlasTikobots! As many of us who live near the oceans, or any body of water for that matter, know that plastic products are one of the top forms of pollution found in those areas. All of these PlasTikobots are made from that very same plastic pollution. According to the California Coastal Commission approximately 1,224,663 tons of debris was collected during California Coastal Cleanup day in 2010; a large amount of which was plastic. This debris can be harmful to many plant and animal species that live in these aquatic ecosystems. They can swallow the plastic pieces which they aren’t able to digest, or it could even choke them. In addition, the chemical compounds in the plastic can leach out into the water changing its chemistry and introducing harmful toxins. When you look closely you can actually begin to make out the different types of plastic that constitute the PlasTikobots. Each one is made from plastic products collected from a beach or near a waterway. We have made them in order to call attention to the increasing problem of plastic, and other pollution in these delicate and vital ecosystems. "PlasTikobots were created and designed by Southern California Artist, Claudio Garzon"
fAT SLOB is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health, leading to reduced life expectancy and/or increased health problems.[1][2] Body mass index (BMI), a measurement which compares weight and height, defines people as overweight (pre-obese) when their BMI is between 25 kg/m2 and 30 kg/m2, and obese when it is greater than 30 kg/m2.[3]\\nObesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, breathing difficulties during sleep, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis.[2] Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive dietary calories, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility, although a few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications or psychiatric illness. Evidence to support the view that some obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is limited; on average obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.[4][5]\\nThe primary treatment for obesity is dieting and physical exercise. To supplement this, or in case of failure, anti-obesity drugs may be taken to reduce appetite or inhibit fat absorption. In severe cases, surgery is performed or an intragastric balloon is placed to reduce stomach volume and/or bowel length, leading to earlier satiation and reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.[6][7]\\nObesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing prevalence in adults and children, and authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century.[8] Obesity is stigmatized in the modern Western world, though it has been perceived as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history, and still is in many parts of Africa.[2][9] by fat slob productions.

'''processor'''-\\nprocessor is main part of a computer processor processes all the data we give  to it and shows us output \\n\\nA different approach to improving a computer's performance is to add extra processors, as in symmetric multiprocessing designs which have been popular in servers and workstations since the early 1990s. Keeping up with Moore's Law is becoming increasingly challenging as chip-making technologies approach the physical limits of the technology.\\n\\nIn response, the microprocessor manufacturers look for other ways to improve performance, in order to hold on to the momentum of constant upgrades in the market.\\n\\nA multi-core processor is simply a single chip containing more than one microprocessor core, effectively multiplying the potential performance with the number of cores (as long as the operating system and software is designed to take advantage of more than one processor). Some components, such as bus interface and second level cache, may be shared between cores. Because the cores are physically very close they interface at much faster clock speeds compared to discrete multiprocessor systems, improving overall system performance.
Food is the primary needs of human life, and food comes from agriculture. But the science of agriculture is not the familiar territory to human. Like the sun, air, water, the most important elements of our existence, but they are also the most overlooked resources. As a result, agriculture in long history, has been operating in a rather primitive way. That makes it into a low-income and the most volatile industry. Its production is the most unpredictable. Because of this, famine is never disappeared until now since the history of mankind. In fact agriculture covers a wide and advance knowledge. Human beings should put in more effort in agricultural science and agricultural investment to make agriculture as an easy, efficient and stable industry. Ensure humans the most basic resources for survival. In particular, new trends have shown that agricultural products have been not just in food. They will be more in line with environmental or ecological balance, sustainable development, the source of new energy and new materials. How to promote agricultural development, symbiotic with natural ecosystems, should be the key topics of concern and discussion.
'''Globalization of Markets and Competition: Trade is increasingly global in scope today. There are several reasons for this. One significant reason is technological—because of improved transportation and communication opportunities today, trade is now more practical. Thus, consumers and businesses now have access to the very best products from many different countries. Increasingly rapid technology lifecycles also increases the competition among countries as to who can produce the newest in technology. In part to accommodate these realities, countries in the last several decades have taken increasing steps to promote global trade through agreements such as the General Treaty on Trade and Tariffs, and trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the European Union (EU).''Italic text'''''
Madison residents are no strangers to mercury contamination in fish, a result of the high mercury levels present in Lake Monona. However, the global extent of mercury pollution is less widely-advertised. In August, the International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant met at the Monona Terrace and ratified a declaration claiming that reducing mercury use and emissions are necessary steps to lowering the health risks associated with the element and its compounds.\\n\\n“The declaration summarizes what we know about mercury in the environment, from a wide array of expertise,” said David Krabbenhoft, a research scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey and a conference co-chair.\\n\\nMercury is an environmental pollutant that has been released in increasing amounts by manufacturers ever since the Industrial Revolution. High levels of mercury exposure in humans have been shown to have a variety of toxic effects, many of which stem from mercury’s ability to inhibit enzymes from breaking down other toxins. From damaging developing fetuses to increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, mercury’s toxic effects are felt throughout one’s lifetime.\\n\\nThe conference did not dwell purely upon the human health risk, however. The declaration covered four major topics, including sources of mercury in the atmosphere, risk to humans, fish and wildlife, recovery of mercury-contaminated fisheries and socioeconomic impacts of mercury use and pollution.\\n\\nCurrently much of the mercury pollution comes from industrial mining operations worldwide, especially those mining gold and other precious metals. Miners release mercury compounds into the air as a byproduct of modern extraction techniques, and can accumulate toxic levels of some compounds in their body, contaminating their homes and communities.\\n\\n“About 10 to 15 million miners are using about a thousand tons of mercury a year to extract gold, exposing themselves and the families to elevated concentrations of mercury vapor and contributing to about ten percent of the human load of mercury to the global environment,” said Edward Swain, a conference co-chair and research scientist at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\\n\\nOther major sources of mercury pollution include coal-fired power plants and volcanic eruptions. Mercury also leaks slowly from many kinds of thermometers and fluorescent lamps.\\n\\n“It is clear that [long-term] mercury use and environmental releases of mercury have had significant social and economic cost,” Swain said.\\n\\nAs mercury is released into the surrounding environment, it travels up the food chain. Soil absorbs mercury compounds, which are drawn into plants through their roots. Animals consume these plants and slowly develop dangerous concentrations of mercury throughout their lives. Fish can also develop high concentrations of mercury simply by absorbing the chemical while swimming in mercury-heavy waters.\\n\\nHigh levels of mercury, if present in food animals, are easily passed to humans. Humans also absorb mercury from the surrounding atmosphere through the skin.\\n\\nMercury usage and pollution is heavily linked to the economic and political fabric of our world. Within the last 30 years, mercury emissions have increased in developing nations, counteracting the progress made in decreasing mercury emissions in developed states. Developed nations often have regulatory power over the production standards, while developing nations have much lower emissions standards in order to maintain production in a harsh economic climate.\\n\\nMercury, however, does not discriminate based upon socioeconomic status. Like any other global environmental hazard, mercury affects everyone.
The mission of the INDC is to increase our understanding of the effects of common food on long term health, performance, mental and physical fitness.\\n\\nTo achieve this goal, we need to gain insight into bioactive compounds in food, how they are absorbed and metabolized in the body, taking into account the genetic and metabolic uniqueness of individuals. \\n\\nThis requires very sensitive analytical methods to determine what we really eat. The same instrumentation can be used to control quality and content of food and to analyze metabolites and nutritional biomarkers.\\n\\nWe do not eat the same bread or drink the same beer that our grandparents did hundred years ago. Agriculture and food technology have changed greatly and must be taken into account to evaluate the effect of these technologies on the nutritional value of food and its effect on human health.\\n\\nWe also have to consider the health effect of our life style; one of sitting in front of the computer, in a car or on an airplane. Our body evolved to produce chemicals to help us to survive but with an active lifestyle. The result is that, we now live in a new state of physiological stress. \\n\\nMeaningful food recommendations based on such understanding is limited. It is critical to understand what to eat and how these foods are metabolized and what molecules are produced in the human body as a reaction to stress.\\n\\nIt is the goal of INDC to bring together an understanding of the food we eat with the analytical techniques needed to study them.\\n\\nINDC2012 will be held at Carolinum, Charles University in Prague, August 27-30, 2012. \\n\\nReferences:http://www.indc.cz/en/

Green buildings consume 15% less materials, use 30% less energy, and require 40% less water than the conventional building.\\nDavid Boldini & Partners will be to build green, in turn making a significant reduction in CO2 emissions.\\nDavid Boldini is a prominent green activist and environmentalist too.              \\nFrom protecting rainforests to advocating for animals and alternative fuels, the work of David Boldini covers a variety of issues and causes.
The explosive beginning of our universe, the Big Bang marks the earliest time we can probe with current physical theory. Theory has to guide our understanding of the first fraction of a second, since we can’t recreate the extremely high temperatures that existed during the earliest history of the universe in any earthly laboratory. What theory tells us is that from an initial state in which matter and radiation are both in an extremely hot and dense form, the universe expands and the matter cools. At that time, it is believed that all four of the fundamental forces of nature—gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces—were unified.\\n\\n       The evolution of the earliest universe is not well understood because it is not clear exactly what laws were at work. However, it is known that by the end of the first second of time, the building blocks of matter had formed. By the end of the first three minutes, helium and other light nuclei (like deuterium) had formed but for a long time, temperatures remained too high for the formation of most atoms. At around one million years following the Big Bang, nuclei and electrons were at low enough temperatures to coalesce to form atoms. But the universe didn’t start to look like it does today until small perturbations in the matter distribution were able to condense to form the stars and galaxies we know today.
     There has been extensive coverage of Martin Luther King, Jr's troubles with the FBI.  As Donner's book "The Age of Surveillance" points out many other individuals and groups, integrationist and segregationist, were targeted by the FBI and other intelligence agencies.  Those targeted were subject to "agressive" intelligence.  That is actions to hinder or harm the organizations and individuals.  Such activity was so widespread that it appears to represent an official, but clandestine, policy.  This raises the possibility that the federal government or some part thereof had decided racial agitation during the Cold War could be an intolerable threat to national security.  Attempting to control racial agitation by legal action might actually increase racial animosities so clandestine action was required.  In view of the extent of this suppression of lower level racial agitators it was probably felt essential to "neutralize" Dr. King.  The same possibility occurs in the case of George Wallace.\\n     In both cases these assassinations or attempts were investigated by the federal government which may have been a party to them.  This raises more unanswered questions about these events.

Definition\\nMangrove restoration is the regeneration of mangrove forest ecosystems in areas where they have previously existed. The practice of mangrove restoration is grounded in the discipline of restoration ecology, which aims to “[assist] the recovery of resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed” (Forest Service Manual, 2000). Since environmental impacts are an ongoing threat, to successfully restore an ecosystem implies not merely to recreate its former condition, but to strengthen its capacity to adapt to change over time.\\n \\nMangrove forests, along with the animal species they shelter, represent globally significant sources of biodiversity and provide humanity with valuable ecosystem services. They are used by mammals, reptiles and migratory birds as feeding and breeding grounds, and provide crucial habitats for fish and crustacean species of commercial importance. The roots of the mangrove physically buffer shorelines from the erosive impacts of ocean waves and storms. Additionally, they protect riparian zones by absorbing floodwaters and slowing down the flow of sediment-loaded river water. This allows sediments to drop to the bottom where they are held in place, thus containing potentially toxic waste products and improving the quality of water and sanitation in coastal communities. \\n\\nTo the human communities who rely on them, mangrove forests represent local sources of sustainable income from the harvest of fish and timber, as well as non-timber forest products such as medicinal plants, palm leaves and honey. On a global scale, they have been shown to sequester carbon in quantities comparable to higher-canopy terrestrial rainforests, which means that they may play a role in mitigating climate change (Spalding, 2010), in addition to physically protecting coastlines from the projected sea-level rise associated with climate change (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). However, there are limits to the capacity of mangroves to adapt to climate change. It is projected that a 1-meter rise in sea level could inundate and destroy mangrove forests in many regions around the globe (IPCC AR4 [correct citation?]), which would leave coastal communities vulnerable to the risks of flooding, shoreline erosion, saline intrusion and increased storm activity (Field, 1995). \\n\\n2. Mangrove loss and degradation \\nThe issue of restoration is critical today since mangrove forests are being lost very quickly – at an even faster rate than tropical rainforests inland (Duke et al., 2007). A recent estimate puts the total mangrove area worldwide in 2005 at 152,000 km2 – down from 188,000 km2 in 1980 (Food and Agriculture Organization Report, 2007). In other words some 36,000 km2, or nearly 20% of the world’s mangroves, were lost over a period of twenty-five years. Other estimates of loss may differ due to having been drawn from a smaller pool of data. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment estimates the total loss worldwide at 35% between 1980 and 2000, but this result was drawn from data on only slightly more than half of the total mangrove area (MA, 2005). Much of this lost mangrove area was destroyed to make room for industry, housing and tourism development; for aquaculture, primarily shrimp farms; and for agriculture, such as rice paddies, livestock pasture and salt production (FAO, 2007). Other drivers of mangrove forest destruction include activities that divert their sources of freshwater, such as groundwater withdrawals, the building of dams, and the building of roads and drainage canals across tidal flats.\\n\\n3. Mangrove restoration \\nMangroves are sensitive ecosystems, changing dynamically in response to storms, sediment blockage, and fluctuations in sea level (Field, 1998) and present a “moving target” for restoration efforts. Different restoration approaches face this challenge in different ways. The most common method simply consists in planting stands of a single species of mangrove on mudflats, or other areas thought to be suitable, without consideration of whether or not they supported mangroves in the past. This approach usually fails over the long term because the underlying soil and hydrological requirements of the mangroves are not being met. More informed methods aim to bring a damaged mangrove area back into its preexisting condition, taking into account not only ecosystem factors but also social, cultural and political perspectives (Field, 1998). These approaches begin with the understanding that a damaged mangrove area may be able to repair itself through the natural processes of secondary succession, without being physically planted, provided that its tidal and freshwater hydrology is functioning normally and there is an adequate supply of seedlings (Lewis, 2005, 2009a, 2009b). Taking this into account, it becomes crucial to the success of a restoration project to evaluate what the hydrology of a disturbed mangrove site should look like under normal conditions, and the ways in which it has been modified.\\n\\nAn exemplar of this approach is the Ecological Mangrove Restoration method (Lewis, 2005, 2009a, 2009b) which recommends the following steps, to be undertaken using healthy mangroves of the surrounding area as a reference: 1) assess the ecology, especially reproduction and distribution patterns, of the mangrove species at the disturbed site; 2) map the topographical elevations and hydrological patterns that determine how seedlings should establish themselves at the site; 3) assess the changes made to the site that currently prevent the site from recovering by itself; 4) design a restoration plan that begins by restoring the normal range of elevations and tidal hydrology at the site; and 5) monitor the site to determine if the restoration has been successful in light of the original objectives. The actual planting of seedlings is a last resort, since it fails in many cases (Lewis, 2005); it should be considered only if natural recruitment of seedlings fails to reach the restoration objective. \\n\\n4. Additional considerations\\nAn important but often overlooked aspect of mangrove restoration efforts is the role that the local communities play as stakeholders in the process and the outcome. Since they may directly feel the effects of restoration projects, they should be involved in the process as much as feasibly possible, from decision-making to maintenance over the long term. Their involvement and local knowledge, as well as collaboration with other stakeholders such as sponsors and governing agencies, is crucial to the success of restoration projects.\\n\\n5. Limitations\\nIn some areas, restoration may be prohibitively difficult due to the degradation of the soil that regularly follows the clear-cutting of mangrove forests. Common effects include advanced erosion of the soil, loss of nutrients, high levels of salinity, and/or buildup of toxins (Field, 1998). However, even without this extent of degradation, the soil may be come unable to host plant life at all due to the loss of the live mangrove roots, which exuded oxygen and carbohydrate into the soil and maintained its quality. \\n\\nUsing foresight early in the restoration process to carefully select sites that are likely to succeed as self-maintaining ecosystems, as well as ensuring that proper management is built into the conservation effort, can prevent the waste of time and energy that often accompanies restoration projects. The long-lasting aftereffects of mangrove degradation underscore the importance of eliminating its causes, since once sites are cleared, they may never completely recover. \\n\\n6.

In recent years many of the world leading ancient wonders preservators have published that the modern environment has a large impact on these historic buildings and sites.\\nOne of the latest discoveries in this field states that ultraviolet radiation(UVR) has a large impact on the material from which these buildings are built.\\nThe material itself may be imune to such things at first, but being exsposed to it for such a long time surely takes it toll, not to mention that time itself slowly degrades all materials on Earth.\\nIn these statments the leading researchers say that UVR seems to influence the bonds between atoms and molecules, and with this making the material(in this case rock) much less durable than usually.\\nSuch cases were found in Egypt(Pyramids), Rome(Coliseum)and almost all other locations where there are hot and dry summers(deserts, mediterainian climate).
=== Understanding Climate Change ===\\n{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n\\nContents\\n\\n    1. Introduction to Climate Change\\n    2. Cause of Climate Change\\n    3. Proof of Climate Change\\n    4. Solutions to Climate Change\\n    5. Overview\\n   \\n\\n\\n1. Governments and scientists alike have agreed that climate change is real and serious. It is a major environmental issue that affects many aspects of today’s society and will affect everyone in the future. Climate change is not a new matter although numerous plans have been implemented recently to accommodate this important issue, particularly in Australia. The continuation of greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere naturally and unnaturally, contributes to the global warming of the planet which causes severe problems which society will have to deal with in generations to come. Not only will we as a society have to look into using cleaner forms of energy, but also sustainable energy that can accommodate the worlds requirements as we expand globally. \\n\\n[[File:Vegetation Induced Circular Snowmelt.jpg|thumb|right|Melted Snow due to the effects of global warming ]]\\n\\n2. There is overwhelming evidence that our climate is changing due to human activities and through natural processes which is unequivocal. One of the main factors that contribute to our climate change in recent years is the increase of greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere, trapping the ultraviolet rays produced by the sun in the earth’s atmosphere and slowly heating the planet. These greenhouse gases are composed of a variety of gases that can absorb and emit infrared radiation such as: carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide and are released mainly through the burning and consumption of fossil fuels. These fossil fuels are what drive the majority of the electrical and motorised power that we use today, from lighting to vehicles to massive industrial power stations and are the main sources of the world’s power. Although, this damaging power comes at a cost, where the environment we live in suffers whilst society continues to use more and more, disregarding the potential threats and problems that are sure to follow with this costly system of living.\\n\\n\\n3. Climate change is the variation in the average pattern of weather over a long period of time. It is generally referred to as ‘global warming’ as all of the earth’s entities are gradually heated by the trapped ultraviolet rays in the atmosphere. This alteration in the weather causes countless problems for the earth’s environment and all living things. The evidence is clear, the increase of global average air, ocean and land temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and the rising of sea levels globally. This causes many detrimental effects for the environments ecosystems and for the animals living in them, for example, the melting of the polar ice caps that are home to polar bears makes it extremely difficult for them to live and thrive as much of their home has been dissolved. Everyone and everything is affected by climate change even on a local level, in Darwin, Australia the rainfall in certain areas has caused major flooding in some low-lying parts, this occurs at high tide when the creeks overflow, although only recently has the flooding occurred due to the rising sea levels. The flooding ruined many houses in the area, blocking roads and caused thousands of dollars’ worth of damages and this is only the beginning. If the greenhouse gases continue to be released into the atmosphere to instigate these chains of events, the disasters in the future will be a lot worse and potentially life-threatening.\\n\\n4. Climate change can be minimised and it is possible to contribute positively to the reduction of greenhouse gases and therefore global warming. Much of the damage afflicted to our planet over the years is irreversible, although there are countless methods and solutions to help save our earth from early catastrophe.  Organizations like ‘Greenpeace’ have numerous ways to protect the environment and work towards sustainable lifestyles that aren’t harmful to the environment.  Some methods that can be incorporated on a large scale is the use of energy-efficient light bulbs which save power by using less current, this has proven to be successful as it reduces the amount of power needed to produce light and therefore less fossil fuels are consumed and less greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. Renewable energy sources such as solar power, wind power and tidal power are also ways to help reduce the emissions produced by using them as alternative energy sources. Other methods that the Australian government have implemented to reduce greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere by large industries is the clean energy bill. The Australian government proposed the clean energy bill in a bid to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and limit global warming by forcing businesses to pay $23 per tonne of CO2 emissions which will pressure large businesses into finding alternative fuel sources that are renewable. Through innovation and creativity, society can find various forms of alternative energy that does not harm our environment and restore it so that the inhabitants of the ecosystems can thrive.\\n\\n5. Global warming also referred to as climate change in the modern society has a large impact on all living things on the planet. The effects of these changes in weather can cause major disruptions in ecosystems potentially destroying habitats of animals and their environment that is irreplaceable. Many solutions are available to help reduce the ever increasing global warming and work towards a cleaner, greener society.
\\n===Earthquake===\\n\\nAn [[earthquake]] is a [[phenomenon]] that results from a sudden release of stored energy that radiates [[seismic wave]]s. At the [[Earth]]'s surface, earthquakes may manifest themselves by a shaking or displacement of the ground and sometimes [[tsunamis]]. Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000-km-long, horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, also known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part bounds the [[Pacific Plate]]. Many earthquakes happen each day, few of which are large enough to cause significant damage.\\n                                                                                                                                                                              \\n  THREE CAUSES OF AN EARTHQUAKES ARE :\\n  There are three main types of fault that may cause an earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip.(1) Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended.(2) Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened.(3) Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other.\\n\\n  THREE EFFECTS OF AN EARTHQUAKE ARE :\\n\\n   (1) This includes damage to buildings and in worst cases the loss of human life.(2)The effects of the rumbling produced by earthquakes usually leads to the destruction of structures such as buildings, bridges, and dams.(3)They can also trigger landslides.
EDUCATION IN COSTA RICA.\\n\\nIn what used to be a poverty-stricken rural backwater, it is understandable that the country's high standards of schooling are a source of enormous national pride. With foregone military budgets funding the massive education system, the only armies these days are hordes of neatly-uniformed schoolchildren on their way to and from school-one of the most ubiquitous images of Costa Rica.\\n\\nEducation is seen as the means to income (salaries are determined by academic level)and status-everyone wants to be cultured. As nearly every job, however menial, requires a high-school education, many adults study at evening classes or through distance learning, choosing from the huge array of courses available.\\n\\nWhile the level of education in Costa Rica is clearly high for the region, and one of the reasons why the country is so popular with foreign business investors in Costa Rica real estate, it seems that a good education is increasingly becoming an issue of wealth.
Viral Influenza Shedding:  It appears that reliable information about viral shedding of Influenza A in general and the current H1N1 "Swine Flu" epidemic is not readily available. In order to rationally recommend quarantine of affected individuals in schools, work sites or other closed communities, it is necessary to know the rate at which affected individuals become less contagious to others. This page is intended to attract commentary from knowledgeable contributors about how rapidly  H1N1 infected individuals can be returned to their communities without unduly risking their colleagues. Although current public health policy recommends isolation from 5 to 10 days after the apparent onset of illness, the scientific basis for this recommendation seems obscure beyond experiments involving artificial viral infection with vaccination strains.
In business, reducing operations to the bare minimum required to continue serving existing business; colloquially, the least necessary to 'keep the lights on'. It emphasizes only those functions needed to continue serving the firm's customers and slows/halts/cancels all other operations (research, development, hiring, promotions and non-salary compensation, capital improvements, etc.)\\n\\nDuring bad economic times, the progression of operations to a lights-on mode typically takes place over several weeks or months of cutbacks, project cancellations and layoffs. \\n\\nThe term also applies to much faster-developing situations, such as a disaster, pandemic or other event that renders large portions of the workforce or infrastructure unable to function. \\n\\nAt larger firms, this mode is part of formal Operational Plan under a variety of names ('Run the Firm', 'Reduced-overhead', etc.)  The Plan is used as a tool to catgeorize projects, assets and infrastructure as part of normal operations. While this is usually to help plan for rapid-onset crises, the same designations eventually apply to a slow-moving economic downturn. \\n\\nSmaller firms usually do not have such formal plans, instead relying on management to designate key people and projects.

The results indicate that trauma is caused by the consequence of young people becoming homeless, and the lives of these men and women should be understood. Other causes for homelessness are issues from people living in poverty, lack of employment, houses being too expensive, gentrification and violence. All of these reasons is why people are now becoming homeless at young ages. \\n\\nYoung children are becoming homeless as well. There are major risks for homeless children, such as poor health care, not having a good well-being and having bad social outcomes. These children are exposed to a very stressful life style, they witness a lot of domestic violence, mental health difficulties and most likely to come from a broken home. In about every 200 children in America, 3 will become homeless today and more then double of that will be at risk for homelessness. School is impacted by homelessness, because of residency requirements, guardianship requirements, delays in transfer of school credits, use of transportation and lack of health resources. Even the children who still attend school that are homeless, have a low attendance record.\\n\\nThere have been alliances that organizations have created to end homelessness. There are studies and estimations that have been made to figure out how many individuals today are homeless. There are strategies that are listed about how to end it and ways to gain more knowledge on the topic as well.
I'm an Astronomy Masters student with a particular interest in terraforming and space colonisation. I wholeheartedly believe that there's an urgent need to solve humanity's problems by making clear advancements in space discovery and colonisation. We need, now more than ever, to start thinking in bigger terms and move on from our earth-bound, earth-centric view. With thousands of years of progress already under our belts, now's the time to step up and take ourselves to the next level. Creative solutions to pressing problems are urgently required! Advancements will only come from more research and hence from greater funding. And that will only come about if there is a groundswell of understanding and support significant enough to shift the political and economic agenda.
Africa Mission Alliance (AMA) is a faith-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Portland, Oregon with subsidiaries in East and Central Africa. The work of AMA began in the country of Rwanda in 2003 as a few individuals dedicated to caring for orphans, widows and the needy in this genocide ravaged country. AMA’s dream is to reach beyond Rwanda into all of Africa and see a new generation of Africans becoming change agents in their vulnerable communities. \\nThe mission of Africa Mission Alliance is to bring professional and general public resources together for the purposes of training, equipping, and supporting local communities in Africa to develop self-sustaining, community-based approaches to solving their problems.\\n\\nAMA believes that the people of Africa do not want to live on handouts. They need help to discover and use their own vision, skills, and resources to achieve self-sufficiency. Africa Mission Alliance is committed to walking and working with communities in Africa by empowering them to build sustainable communities. The larger vision is to address critical needs that hinder development by helping communities receive quality education, skills training, basic health care, access to clean water, and micro-finance loans
contingency plan\\n\\nA contingency plan is a plan devised for an exceptional risk that, though unlikely, would have catastrophic consequences. Contingency plans are often devised by governments or businesses. For example, suppose many employees of a company are traveling together on an aircraft which crashes, killing all aboard. The company could be severely strained or even ruined by such a loss. Accordingly, many companies have procedures to follow in the event of such a disaster. The plan may also include standing policies to mitigate a disaster's potential impact, such as requiring employees to travel separately or limiting the number of employees on any one aircraft.\\n\\nDuring times of crisis, contingency plans are often developed to explore and prepare for any eventualit
Is the Kyoto Protocol heading toward (or does it already contain) provisions for emissions trading or a [[cap and trade]] program?\\n\\nWill nations such as India and China which won't be bound by the protocol, nevertheless participate in a trading program? That is, will they get tens of billions of dollars from the industrialized West (US and Europe) simply for doing nothing?\\n\\nIf global warming is caused by sunspots more than carbon dioxide, and the average atmosphure temperatures levels off at 1.0C to 1.5C higher than the 2000 level, won't the whole thing have amounted to nothing more than an international welfare program for countries with anti-free-market economic policies?\\n\\nI worry about this sort of thing, you know.\\n\\n[[user:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]], Wednesday, June 12, 2002
'''Psoriasis''' is an auto-immune disease with symptoms of red, itchy, scaly, and inflamed. Most suffers typically treat themselves with over-the-counter treatments and prescribed medications. Many negative side effects are attributed to the use of prescribed medications.\\n\\nFor years the herbal treatments for the reduction of psoriasis symptoms have been largely ignored by mainstream physicians. Many health food stores and alternative practitioners are embracing the use of herbs in their stores, practices, and suggestive selling.\\n\\nOne of the trend setters in this arena is a small company out of Tampa, FL., SielosRx. Their use of organic herbs in a cleansing and soothing regimen has caught the eye of local Dermatologist, Dr. Francis Caban. He sees people who have normally received limited results with traditional medications obtain surprising results within weeks of using nothing more than the organic herbs in these products.\\n\\nDr. Caban insists the results are genuine and has offered SielosRx to his clients when they are considering treatment options. He is firm in his belief that psoriasis suffers can choose how they reduce the symptoms of their disease. They no longer have to just suffer or take the medications that have potentially harmful side effects.
<blockquote>\\nThe Earth Sciences (also known as geoscience, the geosciences or Earth Science) is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth. It is a special type of planetary science; it studies the planet we live on: the structure and composition of the Earth, its origins, physical features, changing aspects, and all of its natural phenomena. The major disciplines of The Earth Sciences use physics, mathematics and, chemistry to build a quantitative understanding of the principal areas or spheres of the Earth system. Like in many sciences, The Earth can be studied both experimentally and theoretically. Also, there are both reductionist and holistic approaches to Earth Science.

\\n'''Reasons For Unemployment in Kerala'''\\n\\nIt is interesting to know that the State with the highest literacy rate — almost 97 per cent — has the highest unemployment rate when compared to others. Kerala is known for large-scale migration of skilled labour to other States and countries. \\n\\nA few millions of people of the State have been working outside it for many years. Had they remained in Kerala, the unemployment rate would have been much higher than what was quoted in the article. \\n\\nWhat ails the State that has such a high literacy rate and is also blessed by vast natural resources? \\n\\nDoes the education system make people lethargic or rights-conscious or inefficient or unenterprising to start productive activities for their own progress? Does the education system make people more destructive in nature? \\n\\nNo industrialist wants to set up any industry in Kerala due to labour problems. The State is bankrupt, besides being corrupt and largely politicised. Trade unionism is still alive in Kerala. West Bengal was industrially ruined by the same attitude of the workers despite a highly skilled labour force. \\n\\nInstead of migrating to other States for jobs, Keralites should use their knowledge and expertise in establishing new productive activity on their own. Many of them should look at self-employment for overcoming the serious problem of unemployment.
'''PRANAV'''\\nThe Changing Nature Of Festivals – Fun Or Rituals? \\nPeople from different religions and regions all over India celebrate a number of festivals – religious, cultural and social. The celebrations of such festivals help people come together, shed their egos and the consciousness of individual identities and results in integration. Man is a social animal. He has formed a society and has maintained his own culture. Culture clubs together religion, territorial necessities and requirements of nature and civilisation. The essence of culture can be seen in many festivals. Festivals celebrated all over India follow different regional traditions. Common festivals celebrated in India are Raksha-Bandhan, Navratri, Rangpanchami, Ganesh Utsav etc.In recent years there has been some criticism about the supposedly excessive use of firecrackers, especially during the Hindu festival of Deepavali. The most commonly cited reason is the noise pollution caused by firecrackers.The noise from firecrackers has a more deleterious effect on animals who have a more sensitive sense of hearing than humans. Pets such as dogs and cats, as well as stray cattle in and around cities are most affected. Voluntary and non-profit organizations such as People for Animals educate the public about these issues.Another criticism is that smog caused by firecrackers may be harmful to inhale and can cause difficulty for drivers because of reduced visibility. The usage of "rockets" near apartment buildings has also given rise to many injuries. No law prohibiting this has been passed.
12forests, was founded in Chicago, IL, in 2008. The focus of the organization is  to help the world end exploitation and its causes. It uses proven vedic and yogic methodologies, to distribute karma free vegetarian food, educate and develop sustainable villages. Its outlook is always wide, focusing on how the world views the environment and all living beings.  Understanding the importance of clean and safe environment it introduces everyone to proven strategies of simple development based on cows and land.  12forests which comes from an extensive research background on the importance of cows, as seen in ayurveda and yoga.  The dung and urine of the cow provides for an antiseptic environment which would help third world countries counteract the threats of unsanitary conditions.  Also, it helps to set aside petroleum based and human feces fertilizers as used in the USA and Mexico.  These fertilizers have caused countless deaths in the form of e.coli and cancers, and not to speak of destroying water supplies.  So based on the highest scientific models 12forests is helping poverty stricken children, families and the environment from forced degradation.\\n<ref>12forests.org</ref>
	Abortion has become one of the most divisive issues in American society today, and differing opinions often lead to heated discussions, political division, and even violence.Ever since the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v Wade, this controversial issue has split the nation. Some people agree with Roe and support abortion, others are against it. It is obviously a problem that needs to be solved, and quickly.\\n        The battle over abortion has been going on for a very long time, but really came to public view after the supreme court decision in Roe v Wade.  In this case, a woman whom the court discretely called "Jane Roe" sued in order for women to be able to legally have abortions, even if not in a life threatening situation. The court ruled in her favor, but since then there have been multiple attempts to overturn their decision.
In Alaska, the significant variation in both climate and population make standard architectural applications impractical. The summer months in Alaska draw in more than half of the yearly income for the state due to the increase in construction, commercial fishing, logging and mining, and the tourism industry.  In some regions, including southeastern Alaska, the population fluctuates as much as two thirds from January to July.  This irregularity creates a huge strain on the city especially in the realm of housing.  The majority of the seasonal population is currently expected to live in modular housing units fabricated to withstand less than three years, demanding an unbelievable amount of government funds that could be used elsewhere for city development.  Not only is this economically and environmentally unsound, but it provides only the bare necessities for this population.  This is why a seasonal housing facility is pivotal to the success of the state as a whole and specifically to those cities with a large seasonal population.  The large variation in population between the summer and winter months has created a need for housing types that can “hibernate” seasonally to reduce the amount of necessary energy and maintenance. Not only would this produce a more suitable and environmentally conscious method of housing the seasonal population, but also increase the possibility of permanent residence through an increase in the quality of life.  Although the application of seasonal buildings would be beneficial to most cities in the state of Alaska because of the migration patterns of the seasonal populations, the city of Juneau is particularly affected.  This city, the state’s capital, looses almost one third of its population in this seasonal shift, and yet has maintained a significant role in the economic success of the state.   However, Juneau suffers from housing shortages, urban sprawl and unfavorable living conditions.  This is why the application of a fluctuating, multifamily housing facility would accommodate the seasonal population, densify the current population, and employ environmentally responsive technology to help reduce the overall cost of living.  The success of the proposed building type would change the face of Alaskan housing and address the housing crisis that has for so long gone unaddressed. \\n  The underdevelopment of Alaska is often attributed to the unusual conditions of its latitude including dramatic variation in sunlight hours and harsh weather conditions.  However, this argument is undermined when compared to other cities at the same 60oN Latitude.  Glasgow, Scotland, St. Petersburg, Russia, and Stockholm, Sweden are all located within 5 degrees of the latitude of Juneau Alaska, and all are very established ranging in population from .5-5 million.  In addition, these cities are all major contributor to the overall GDP of their respective countries. The city layouts demonstrate the success of the area with the densely build scheme.  The feature of these cities that is not shared by Juneau is the topography.  All of these cities have a very flat landscape making development much less difficult and also ease in the circulation through and into the region.  It can then be concluded that in Alaska the topographical challenge is more detrimental to the development of the state than the cold climate. \\nThe land area of Alaska is 656425 square miles making it account for almost 20% of the total land area of the United States.  It is by far the largest state at more than 60% the size of Texas, 75% the size of California, and 93% larger than Pennsylvania, and yet is one of the most underdeveloped and underutilized areas in the nation.   The land features significant natural resources and the largest amount of coast line out of any other state in the United States.  \\n\\nThe average population of the United States falls just above 304 million.  The average population per state is just above 6 million, and yet the largest state, that which encompasses almost 1/5 of the United States territory has only 626, 932 inhabitants, almost half of the population of Rhode Island.  These numbers are even more significant when one compares the population density of various states.  Alaska with its vast lands and miniscule population is by far the least dense, having an average of only 1.2 residents per square mile. \\nThe states chosen for comparison have a wide variety of geographic and climatic aspects which shows the diversity of population density over the nation, but none even comes close to the discrepancy between these numbers and those exhibited in the region of Alaska.  It is also strange that Alaska’s proximity to the Pacific Northwest, the religion currently experiencing the largest national population growth, has not more directly affected the influx into this adjacent territory.\\n	The economic trends in the United States have a very significant impact on the economy of Alaska.  The trend over the last 30 years has consistently demonstrated this relationship.  During times of economic turmoil in the US, namely recessions, the migration to Alaska increases drastically.  This is largely due to the more stable job market in Alaska, one that operates more independently from other states in the nation.  The lower chart shows the average state GDP vs. various state’s GDP.   The GDP of Alaska is above the US average.  This should result in a higher population due to a more stable economy, as is the trend in the United States, yet the result is inconsistent in Alaska. \\nThe city of Juneau offers a variety of locations that would benefit from the establishment of a large scale housing facility.  This is largely due to the fact that housing development is currently sprawling into the outskirts of the city lines because of cheap and more buildable land.  This has expanded the city limits, but not the density or even overall population.  In addition to sprawl, in the last 30 years the center of Juneau has shifted from the historic downtown area to the land surround the airport.  Unfortunately this diversion has left the downtown in disrepair.  The migration has occurred because the land surround the downtown area is more difficult to build upon, making construction of single family homes more expensive, and because of the significance of the Juneau Airport as a primary gateway into the state of Alaska.  The city is essentially being split in half socially and industrially.  Reorganizing the city development of the city to focus on the historical downtown area would help preserve the city as a destination and not merely a transit hub.  Locating a housing facility in this area would help facilitate this effort, making it more affordable to establish residence.  It would also reduce the need for public transportation because the majority of employment, especially tourism and government based professions, occurs in this section of the city. \\nThe intended program to be developed on this site is a large scale housing facility.  This facility will cater to a variety of people with different needs throughout the city of Juneau.  The core of the facility will be made up of two and three bedroom units that correspond with the current housing market demand in the area.  In addition to these standard units, a portion of the development will be dedicated to affordable housing units to accommodate the portion of the population that is below the poverty line, including a large portion of the native population in and around Juneau.  In addition, a portion of the units will be seasonally adjustable creating a facility that can fluctuate either physically or systematically to accommodate the seasonal population influx.   This portion of the structure will not merely be cut off from the establishment when not in use, but like the city, will change in use to enhance the facility for the permanent residents.  The establishment of a stable and changing population could be a mutually advantageous relationship. The permanent residents help reduce the maintenance and upkeep to the temporary facilities during the off season and in turn receive a portion of the profit from the seasonal residents.  This relationship would change the dynamic between the two groups are result in a more community centered organization.  In addition to housing units, the facility will include amenities that not only increase its desirability for both temporary and permanent residents, but also work to draw in the surrounding community and population of downtown Juneau.  These amenities will be defined and located in a way to ensure security for the residents while still increasing public circulation to and through the building.  The facility will also be developed in a way that is environmentally sensitive in design and perception.  It will capitalize on the aesthetically unique features of the context and utilize the favorable site conditions to become more self sustaining.  The development of a successful housing system will increase the density in downtown Juneau and provide the citizens with a more habitable and experientially significant living experience.\\n<ref>http://ruralhealth.hrsa.gov/pub/seasonalpopulation.asp#Case1.

What are Prayer Wheels?\\n\\n   Prayer wheels contain the words of the Buddha: teachings of wisdom and compassion. While the Buddha's discourses fill many volumes, they may also be condensed into syllables with deep symbolic meaning known as mantra. Tibetans recite these profound and inspiring texts to instill them in memory and promote the well­being of others. \\n\\n   The Tibetan term "dharma wheel" has been rendered into English as "prayer wheel". Yet prayer wheels are much more than supplicants to a higher spirit. They can contain the full potency and meaning of the path to enlightenment.\\n\\n   Believing that turning dharma wheels filled with these texts and symbols is equivalent to reciting them, Tibetans place dharma wheels in monasteries, temples, and libraries and turn them at every opportunity to convey the blessings of compassion and harmony, prevent natural disasters, and promote peace in the world. Although dharma wheels were known in ancient India and Nepal, only in Tibet did they become an integral part of daily life. Today as in ages past, the dharma wheels are honored as symbols of enlightened knowledge, able to evoke the healing powers of the mind and increase its capacities for wisdom.\\n\\n   In recent years, the world has seen how quickly knowledge-even when valued and protected by an entire culture-can be brought to the brink of extinction. In response, we have made great efforts to preserve the cultural heritage of Tibet, including the intricate science of dharma wheels, which are in themselves ways of preserving and disseminating the benefits of enlightened knowledge. Having created more than a thousand 4 foot high wheels for our own organization and donated 100,000 of the hand-held wheels to individuals in the Himalayan region, we have come to share the view that dharma wheels have a calming and healing influence on the environment and human beings, qualities greatly needed in our world today.
Timber framed boat docks are toxic playgrounds.  In 2001, the EPA banned \\narsenic treated wood from our children’s playgrounds because of the deadly \\nhazards of exposure.  Yet, treated timbers are still being used to build boat \\ndocks in many areas throughout the country.  These timbers continuer to leach \\ndeadly toxins year after year.\\n\\nPressure-treated boards and timbers are leaking poisonous arsenic into our \\nsoil and waterways.  The arsenic comes from 'chromated copper arsenate', CCA, \\nan infusion of pesticides, fungicides, and preservatives to delay the natural \\ndecaying process of wood.  These known carcinogens, have been linked to many \\ncancers, poisonings, severe skin rashes, and many other health issues.\\n\\nCCA treated wood, a very common boat dock building material, exposes us to \\nunnecessary danger when we are most vulnerable.  Barely clothed, barefoot, and \\nwet the very waters around these docks continually wash the treated surfaces \\nwhere we play.  All reports and handling guidelines suggest we were gloves, \\nglasses, and long sleeve shirts when handling CCA treated wood.  Yet, once in \\nplace as our waterfront play ground, we can't expect our children to go \\nswimming with so much protection.\\n\\nMore than 30 million pounds of pure arsenic comes  into the U.S. each year. \\nMuch of this is used in treating wood and timbers that will be used in dock \\nconstruction.

== Recycing- the need ==\\n\\n<br />The need for recycling has greatened over the past thirty years as the realisation of global warming has spread throughout the governments of the world. As the threat of rising sea levels, unstable weather conditions and ultimately a heating world creeps upon mankind, some people have decided to take action while others take a back seat. Whatever attitude the world has the simple fact is that changes in the climate are happening and recycling and other methods can contribute to limit the effect of global warming.\\n<br />\\n*[[global warming-overview]]\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n== Global warming-overview==\\nGlobal warming is occurring throughout the world because of increased levels of Carbon Dioxide being emmitted has caused (it is widely believed) the o-zone layer to thicken therefore trapping the suns energy inside the earths atmosphere and heating the earth accordingly.
'''Aquati Equini'''\\nThe Planet of Water!\\n&\\nThe Ancient City of Atlantis!\\n<gallery>\\nImage:Example.jpg|Caption1\\n</gallery>\\n\\nThe Earth as we know today is millions of years old and has undergone many transformations and metamorphic changes. Our planet Aquati Equini the "Earth" and its evolution of the ecosystem, with its physical and spiritual beings is the third planet from the Sun, and the largest of the terrestrial planets in the Solar System in terms of diameter, mass and density. It is also referred to as the World, the Blue Planet, and Terra continues to evolve.It is in the physical world (the third dimension of reality or so called duality)we find ourselves in a world of constant change and unstable eventuality.\\n\\nHome to millions of species,including humans, Earth is the only place in the universe where we find life is known to exist today. The planet formed 4.54 billion years ago,and life appeared on its surface within a billion years. Since then, Earth's biosphere has significantly altered the atmosphere and other abiotic conditions on the planet, enabling the proliferation of aerobic organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which, together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks harmful radiation, permitting life on land.The physical properties of the Earth, as well as its geological history and orbit, allowed life to persist during this period. The world is expected to continue supporting life for another 1.5 billion years, after which the rising luminosity of the Sun will eliminate the biosphere.\\n\\n----\\n\\nMR
A scientific phrase used to explain the recent phenomenon of the gradual cooling of the Gulf Stream.  The phrase comes from the noted effect of heat exchange in the blood flow in the reindeer's body.  In order to conserve warmth, the blood flowing ethrough the legs of a reindeer is considerably colder than that of the rest of it's body.  This is achieved by a heat exchange system; see http://library.thinkquest.org/3500/caribou.html for more details.\\nThis effect has been used to describe the recently discovered cooling of the Gulf Stream while the original equatorial currents have remained of the same temperature.  Over the last 20 years the temperature of the Gulf Stream (passing from the coast of South America up through the Atlantic and past the British Isles) has been studied by scientists in Scotland.  A recent report, published by both the Scientific Institute for Climate Research and Greenpeace, states that the temperature of the Gulf Stream near Scotland has dropped by three degrees celsius over twenty years and by two degrees over the last ten years.  This accelerated cooling has been attributed to the melting of the arctic ice shelf but is disputed by many scientists, mostly in America, where the report has been met with some incredulity.  See the Greenpeace website for a full version of the report.
Although the company labels itself as being environmentally friendly, but BP a major cause of pollution, actually ranked within the top ten worst environmentally friendly corporations. The company is a accused of greenwashing. BP changed its name from British Petroleum to BP, standing for "beyond petroleum" and adopted a yellow sunflower similar to that of the Canadian Green Party symbol. They appear to be green but in fact, none of these green symbols properly portray the company. \\n\\nBetween January 1997 and March 1998, the company was responsible for 104 oil spills and has also been charged for burying polluted gases. The company has also been permitted to dump nearly two-thousand pounds of ammonia and almost five thousand pounds into Lake Michigan everyday. BP allowed 270,000 gallons of oil to spread into the Alaskan tundra, and only admitted to doing so after they were confronted by journalists. BP is responsible for fifteen deaths after one of their oil refineries in Texas exploded. It's also been reported that BP is responsible for spilling nearly two thousand gallons of chemicals onto frozen tundra in Alaska. The chemicals that spilled are poisonous to plants and aniamls, and will melt the tundra. \\n\\nBP does not have good environmental standing. The company donataes over five million dollars to political campaigns, possibly an effort of stay in business and be exempt from US laws. They are guilty of killing and harming the planet, not just in the United States but all over the globe. They are listed as one of Scotland's largest polluters.
The U.S. frequently uses its economic power in order to punish other countries.  One of the ways the U.S. does this is by holding back on exporting food.   Reasons for the punishment of another country vary; however, they can be broken down into two main groups: Foreign containment objective and market development/humanitarian objectives.  The foreign containment objective tends to punish those countries who are threatening to the U.S.  An example of such a threat would be countries under other forms of government.   More examples related to the containment objective would be:  no aid to communist countries, no aid to socialist governments, no aid to countries who support radical regimes, no aid to regimes with an inadequate democracy who are too weak to be anti-communist (effectively), no aid to countries who will not accept U.S. agreements.  An example of market development and humanitarian objectives would fall under a category of countries that are trying to compete with the U.S. economically.  The U.S. will execute foreign aid punishments to countries trying to nationalize property of U.S. companies, countries who want to take over functions by U.S. companies, and countries trying to initiate nationalistic economic policies.
Hemostasis is the arrest of bleeding by the physiological properties of vasoconstriction and coagulation; or more simply, blood clotting. \\nFor our Wiki project we would like to take a closer look at the Hemostasis process, how it happens, and what factors in and outside of the body affect it. By understanding how it works on a cellular level we would like to find out how other things in our bodies can affect it, such as vasoconstriction, vasodilation, age, and the heart. We would like to find out what proteins play a major role in the  hemostasis process and if by adding or taking away certain nutrients can greatly affect the hemostatic response. As far as outside influences we want to figure out the negative and positive effects of different drugs, and certain diseases such as Von Willebrand’s disease and Thrombophilia. \\nBy understanding how the process works and what factors change the response, we believe we can provide an adequate response and a description of how hemostasis works in correlation with the rest of the body.
My report on Thoroughbreds so far:\\n\\nThoroughbreds have a well-chiseled head. Thoroughbreds are considered a hot-blooded horse because of their agility, speed, and spirit.\\n\\nThe thoroughbred that is known today was developed in the 17th and the 18th century, which was 1600 and 1700. All modern Thoroughbreds can find their pedigrees to three stallions originally transported into England in the 1600s and 1700s. During the 1800s and the 1700s, the Thoroughbred breed went around the world. Many thoroughbreds exist worldwide today ,with over 118,000 people registered each year worldwide.   \\n\\nThoroughbreds are usually used for racing but also bred for other riding disciplines, such as show jumping, combined training, and more. They are also cross-bred with other breeds to create new breeds or improve existing breeds.\\n\\nThoroughbred racehorses perform with maximum effort, which has resulted on high rates of accidents and other health problems. Also, thoroughbreds are prone to other health problems, including bleeding from the lungs, small hearts, and more. There are several theories for the reasons behind the frequency of accidents and health problems in the  thoroughbred breed, and research continues into how to reduce the accident rate and treat those animals that are injured.\\n\\nThoroughbreds are most often bay, seal brown, chestnut, black, or gray. The less common colors that are recognized in the United States are roan, palomino, and more. White is not seen that much, but it is also known color separate from the gray.
\\n\\nDual-coding theory, a theory of cognition, was first advanced by Allan Paivio of the University of Western Ontario in 1971. The theory postulates that both visual and verbal information are processed differently and along distinct channels with the human mind creating separate representations for information processed in each channel. Both visual and verbal codes for representing information are used to organize incoming information into knowledge that can be acted upon, stored, and retrieved for subsequent use.\\nEach channel also has limitations. For example, humans have difficulty simultaneously attending to multiple auditory or visual cues, depending on expertise with the task or prior knowledge with the subject area. For example, a television documentary that shows images of plant and animal life in a rain forest while also simultaneously providing narration that describes the animal life could potentially provide for improved learning using the dual-code theory because the visual and verbal information does not compete with each other.\\nA multimedia presentation that shows multiple visuals such as an image of a speaker as well as the text that the speaker is reading, such as a series of bullet points, could overwhelm the viewer, depending on the person and the situation, because the viewer must now attend to two images.
'''Groundwork'''\\n\\nEstablished in 1981, Groundwork is a voluntary environmental organisation, dedicated to the preservation of some of Ireland's most precious habitats: the oak woodlands in Killarney National Park, Co. Kerry.\\n\\nMost of Groundwork’s focus has been on the removal of the invasive Rhododendron ponticum from Killarney National Park.\\n\\nThe unique ecology of the Killarney oak woodlands is seriously threatened by the invasion of Rhododendron ponticum. This non-native shrub thrives in the mild and moist conditions in Killarney and can spread rapidly especially where soils are acidic. Within 25 years rhododendron can form impenetrable thickets with plants up to six metres in height. These thickets cast such a dense shade that almost nothing can grow beneath them. This prevents the regeneration of the oakwoods.\\n\\nDuring the last 27 years Groundwork has changed from a small group of environmentally-concerned Irish students to an organisation attracting conservation-minded people from all over the world to carry out voluntary work in one of Ireland's most beautiful natural landscapes.\\n\\nSee http://www.groundwork.ie
== is the world on the end ==\\n\\nThe 2012 phenomenon comprises a range of eschatological beliefs according to which cataclysmic or transformative events will occur on December 21, 2012.[1][2][3][4] This date is regarded as the end-date of a 5,125-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae have been proposed as pertaining to this date, though none have been accepted by mainstream scholarship.\\nA New Age interpretation of this transition is that this date marks the start of time in which Earth and its inhabitants may undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 2012 may mark the beginning of a new era.[5] Others suggest that the 2012 date marks the end of the world or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world include the arrival of the next solar maximum, or Earth's collision with a black hole, passing asteroid or a planet called "Nibiru".\\nScholars from various disciplines have dismissed the idea of such cataclysmic events occurring in 2012. Professional Mayanist scholars state that predictions of impending doom are not found in any of the extant classic Maya accounts, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar "ends" in 2012 misrepresents Maya history and culture.[3][6][7] Astronomers and other scientists have rejected the proposed events as pseudoscience, stating that they are contradicted by simple astronomical observations.[8]
Overview\\nThe United States is the world’s largest producer of beef, according to the USDA. The United States also has the largest fed-cattle industry in the world, primarily high-quality, grain-fed beef used for both domestic and export use.\\n\\nThe U.S. beef industry has undergone massive improvements in overall system efficiency. High-quality beef continues to flow to consumers even as the overall cattle and calf inventory has dropped from 130 million in 1975 to 92.6 million in 2011 (NASS). This is occurring because of significant improvements to genetics, which has virtually doubled the weaning weights since the 1960s and has made it possible to consistently deliver an animal that has gained 1,000 pounds each month since birth. The other efficiency gains have been made through technology, including growth implants with strategies to optimize their use. Also, industry consolidation has led to more comprehensive use of parasite control, mineral supplementation, good feedbunk management, optimization of rebreeding cycles and much more.\\n\\nLike most commodity production, cattle and beef are subjected to a cyclical pattern of production: a series of peaks and valleys in herd size and production that typically lasts from eight to 12 years. This cycle of production is counter-cyclical to the price. These cycles fall heaviest on the cow/calf sector, which has no real margin recourse or an ability to manage supply effectively. In beef production, large amounts of grain are fed to the animals, so the cattle cycle is affected by the price and supplies of grain as well. Today, we see the effects of foreign trade and the politics of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or more commonly, mad cow disease) dramatically influencing price. While exports generally amount to 7 percent of total beef sales, the effect on price can be dramatic and has been a significant drag on what should be a higher market at this time.\\n\\nThe cattle industry plays an integral role in the country’s economic growth and well being. More than one million cattlemen and women do business in a free-market economy and represent the largest single segment of American agriculture.\\n\\nThe 2007 U.S. Census of Agriculture found that the largest single segment of the U.S. agricultural economy is beef production, with cattle and calves representing about 21 percent of total farm sales.\\n\\nAccording to the American Farm Bureau Federation, agriculture is responsible for approximately 21 million jobs—everything from growing the food to selling it in the supermarket. Beef production itself is a major employer, with more than 186,000 full-time jobs on farms and ranches creating more than 1 million more jobs throughout the economy.\\n\\nDemand\\nBeef consumption in the United States averaged 61.2 pounds per person in 2008, down from 65 pounds in 2000 (ERS 2008). According to USDA, U.S. consumers continue to purchase more meat with a smaller proportion of disposable income, continuing the long-term trend. ERS predicts that over the next 10 years, meat purchases will decline from about 2 percent to 1.3 percent of disposable income. As of 2007, meat purchases accounted for 1.7 percent of disposable personal income and 30 percent of total food expenditures.\\n\\nA USDA study concluded that almost 65 percent of all beef was purchased at retail stores for at-home consumption. Ground beef ranked first for at-home consumption followed by steaks. On average, consumers purchased 43 pounds of beef from retail stores. Ground beef consumed at restaurants accounted for 60 percent of the beef eaten away from home. Consumers purchased more than 23 pounds of beef away from home a year.\\n\\nProduction\\nOn January 1, 2011, the inventory of U.S. beef cows was 30.9 million head, down 2 percent from January 1, 2010. Beef replacement heifers totaled 5.2 million head, down 5 percent. Cattle and calves on feed for slaughter in all feedlots totaled 14 million, up 3 percent.  (NASS 2011)\\n\\nNearly 70 percent of U.S. cattle are produced in the central region of the country, extending from North Dakota to Texas and from South Dakota to Tennessee. According to the 2007 Census of Agriculture, there were 687,540 beef cattle operations in the United States. Texas hosts the largest number of beef operations (131,769), followed by Missouri (51,289), Oklahoma (47,059) and Tennessee (42,344).\\n\\nNebraska, Iowa and Kansas host the largest number of feedlots, but Texas, Kansas, Nebraska and Colorado market the most cattle annually, that is, 5.7 million head, 5.1 million head, 4.8 million head and 1.9 million head, respectively.\\n\\nIn their U.S. Baseline Briefing Book, University of Missouri experts noted that beef demand should strengthen as the U.S. economy recovers.   \\n \\nProcessing\\nBeef production totaled 26.4 billion pounds in 2010, up 1 percent from the previous year. Commercial cattle slaughter during 2010 totaled 34.2 million head, up 3 percent from 2009. The average live weight was 1,279 pounds, down 14 pounds from a year ago. Steers comprised 49.2 percent of the total federally inspected cattle slaughter, heifers 29.8 percent, other cows 10.8 percent, dairy cows 8.3 percent and bulls 1.8 percent. \\n\\nIn their Meat and Poultry Facts 2008, AMI experts speculated that beef slaughter rates will stall, triggering a reconfiguration of the beef packing industry. A South American firm, JBS, purchased two U.S. beef packers in 2008: Swift & Company and Smithfield Beef Group. Barring further consolidation, JBS is likely to dominate the industry in the coming years.\\n\\nAccording to NASS, 632 of the 841 plants operating under federal inspection slaughtered cattle. The 14 largest plants slaughtered 55 percent of the total cattle killed in 2010. In 2006, the four largest plants slaughtered nearly 70 percent of all cattle commercially slaughtered.\\n\\nTop Ten Beef Packers\\nCompany Name and Location 	Daily Capacity\\n\\nTyson Foods, Arkansas\\n	27,375\\nJBS Swift1, Colorado 	26,050\\nCargill Meat Solutions, Kansas 	25,850\\nNational Beef Packing Co., Missouri 	13,100\\nAmerican Foods Group, Minnesota 	5,575\\nNebraska Beef, Nebraska 	3,000\\nGreater Omaha Packing, Nebraska 	2,650\\nXL Beef 	2,200\\n\\nCaviness\\n	1,700\\nCreekstone, Kansas 	1,600\\n1JBS acquired Smithfield Beef Group in October 2008.\\nSource: Meat and Poultry Facts, AMI, January 2010.\\n\\nExports\\nOverall, the U.S. beef industry exported 726,229 metric tons (MT) of beef and veal valued at $3.4 billion. Top buyers, accounting for more than half of the U.S. beef exports, were Mexico, Canada, Japan and South Korea. In 2010, Brazil and Australia exported more beef than the United States. However, these countries primarily graze their cattle on pasture rather than feed them grain.  \\n \\nFactors allowing for the upward momentum in the U.S. beef export market, according to USDA, include the weak dollar and strong economic recovery in the rest of the world, coupled with tightened supplies of competing beef. USDA estimated total U.S. beef exports for 2011 at 2.43 billion pounds or 9.3 percent of U.S. production. \\n\\nImports\\nThe United States remains a net importer of beef. According to FAS, the United States imported 768,558 MT of beef and veal valued at $2.8 billion. Canada continued to rank as the largest supplier of fresh/chilled beef into the United States in 2010, closely followed by Australia.\\n\\nCompetitive Analysis\\nIn terms of red meat expenditures in 2007, Americans spent $270.42 per person on beef (AMI). According to the USDA, U.S. consumers spent $159.37 per person on poultry that year.\\n\\nBeef has traditionally competed with the pork industry for per capita meat consumption with United States and global consumers. However, the poultry industry has increased in per capita meat consumption and the amount of disposable income spent on meat at a greater rate than beef or pork. This trend is attributed in part to the rapid development of convenient poultry products. As more and more consumers work outside the home, convenience and ease of preparation become an issue for the meat industry. Price is also a consideration. \\n\\nValue-added Opportunities\\nBecause the cyclical nature of the beef industry leads to over-supplies and depressed prices, many producers look for alternatives to market their cattle versus the traditional live commodity markets.\\n\\nOrganic Beef\\nDuring the 1990s, organic farming became one of the fastest growing segments of U.S. agriculture. The United States had 43,782 beef cattle certified organic in 2008, up from 20,285 beef cows in 2003. USDA organic standards were implemented in 2002. The United States had 1.85 million acres of pasture and rangeland certified organic in 2008. \\n\\nWhy the large increase in organic beef? Many producers feel it is a good way to lower input costs, decrease reliance on nonrenewable resources, capture high-value markets with premium prices and boost farm income. Organic beef production is based on a system of farming that maintains and replenishes soil fertility without the use of pesticides and fertilizers. Organic beef is minimally processed without artificial ingredients, preservatives or irradiation. For more information on organic beef, please see the Organic Beef section of the Web site.\\n \\nNatural Beef\\nNatural does not have the same strict interpretation as organic does. According to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, all fresh meat qualifies as “natural,” but those labeled “natural” cannot contain any artificial flavor or flavoring, coloring ingredient, chemical preservatives or any other artificial or synthetic ingredient; and the product and its ingredients are not more than minimally processed (ground, for example). Some companies promote their beef as natural because the cattle were not exposed to antibiotics or hormones and were totally raised on a range instead of being “finished” in a feedlot.\\n\\nResearch conducted at Kansas State University has shown that consumers tended to associate natural beef with local, family farms and perceived an increased value from that aspect. Research shows that some suburban, higher income consumers in some regions are willing to pay more for natural beef cuts from the loin. This is a growing market but still a small percentage of total U.S. meat sales.\\n \\nFor more information on natural beef, please see the Natural Beef section of the Web site.\\n \\nBranded/Certified/Verified\\nTraceability, tracking the product from its origin through processing, is becoming a competitive advantage to today’s meat suppliers. Product quality attributes or the actual manufacturing process is verified or certified by a third party.\\n\\nSuch programs may become increasingly important as the food industry makes further attempts to appeal to the social consciousness of consumers. According to USDA, the top three U.S. restaurant franchises place restrictions on how animals used in the companies’ foods are produced, accounting for approximately 35 percent of franchised restaurant sales.\\n\\nFor more information, please visit the Branded/Certified/Verified section of the Web site.\\n \\nDirect Market Beef\\nDirect marketing is selling food and farm products directly to consumers without using an intermediary. This may include direct sales to grocery stores, restaurants, door-to-door and freezer sales and Internet marketing.\\n\\nDirect marketing of livestock products is not as common as other vegetables and melons, for example, because livestock require further processing. The percentage of farms with direct sales was higher in more urbanized counties.\\n\\nHowever, direct marketing can provide prices for producers higher than typical wholesale prices, yet below supermarket prices. Interest in food safety, the environment and alternative agriculture has also supported this growth. Consumers enjoy dealing face-to-face with the producers of the products they are purchasing.\\n\\n\\n"Pastured, or free range, poultry" refers to a poultry production system that is characterized by chickens, turkeys or ducks being raised primarily on pasture. The birds supplement their grain feed by foraging for up to 20 percent of their intake and are often moved regularly to fresh pasture.\\n\\nPastured poultry is a niche market that taps into increased consumer demand for more natural and humanely raised protein sources. Consumers demanding this type of poultry product are generally willing to pay more for the system, which includes raising poultry on grassy pasture to deliver a product that is considered by many consumers to be healthier and tastier, as well as more environmentally sound. Pastured poultry production generally has lower entry costs and thus is attractive to smaller or limited resource farmers.\\n\\nMarketing\\nPastured poultry also taps into the growing natural foods market. Like the natural foods market, the certified organic food market is quite similar in terms of consumer demands and characteristics. The Food Marketing Institute found that 59 percent of consumers look for and purchase products labeled as natural, and 37 percent look for and purchase products labeled as organic. Nutrition Business Journal estimated “natural” and organic food and beverage sales reached $28.2 billion in 2006, a 14.1 percent increase from 2005. However, the same publication found that organic meat sales were 24 percent of the total. While not all pastured poultry is certified organic, comparing the markets can be helpful in determining overall general tendencies in consumer demand.\\n\\nFoods with a "natural" label had $22.3 billion in sales in 2008, according to "Healthy Eating Report for 2008" from the Nielsen Company, New York. The organic food industry, meanwhile, grew to more than $28.6 million in 2010, according to the Organic Trade Association.\\n\\nFarmers' markets are being used as an important marketing outlet for many smaller direct marketing poultry producers. Producers often receive their highest prices at these markets, followed by restaurants. Retail and other sales return the lowest prices.\\n\\nSmall-scale producers sold nearly 50 percent of their chickens directly from their farm. Large-scale producers, defined as producers raising more than 4,000 chickens a year, sold a greater proportion of their chickens to restaurants and retail outlets. \\n\\nThis growth trend in farmers' markets supports the growing consumer demand for direct-marketed, small-scale production techniques such as free range or pastured poultry. For instance, farmers' market consumers are requesting more information about how products were grown and if they were grown organically. According to a 2004 Economic Research Service (ERS) publication, when 210 farmers' market managers were polled, customers with a strong demand for organic products were also interested in environmental and social issues within agriculture, including sustainable development, environmental pollution and wildlife protection. These factors support expanded marketing opportunities for small-scale poultry production such as pastured and free range.\\n\\nPastured meat products and the growth of that market can also be attributed to the fact that a growing number of consumers support smaller farmers, are opposed to livestock raised in confinement and have a set of values that prefer animal products resulting from a pastured system.\\n\\nIn its "America’s Changing Appetite: Food Consumption and Spending to 2020" report, the Economic Research Service (ERS 2002) concluded that U.S. consumers would be demanding more quality due to increased population and an increase in educational attainment and wealth. Quality purchases look at differentiated products and include foods marketed with specific production techniques such as pastured poultry, for instance. Consumers are demanding higher quality, healthy foods, and they are increasingly demanding to know that their food is safe. They also want assurances from agricultural producers, retailers and foodservice workers about how the food was grown and what production techniques were used.\\n\\nAccording to the same ERS study, total poultry purchases are expected to have market growth of 19 percent for at-home meals and 18 percent for away-from-home meals. If specific qualities such as environmental concerns and animal welfare continue to gain consumer support, these types of production systems will provide a growing market for pastured poultry producers.\\n\\nDemand\\nAccording to the National Chicken Council, U.S. consumption of chicken steadily increased from 2000 until peaking at 87.7 pounds per person in 2006. Chicken consumption was 83.8 pounds per person in 2009. Chicken has passed beef and is currently the most consumed meat.\\n\\nProduction\\nThe many management alternatives available to poultry producers are as follows:\\n\\n    * Portable houses\\n    * Pasture pens\\n    * Integrated systems\\n\\nThousands of small farms in the United States and worldwide produce what is called "pastured poultry." To these farmers, pastured poultry means chickens and other poultry raised right on top of living grasses. As long as they get all the grass they want, poultry can qualify to be called grass fed. This is accomplished by keeping the birds in low, wide, bottomless cages called "chicken tractors" that are moved to a new spot of fresh pasture once or more often each day.\\n\\nThe term grass-fed poultry is a larger group, of which the pastured birds are a sub-set. Among producers, grass-fed poultry means birds that are allowed to forage on as much living grasses as they desire, whether in chicken tractors, small coops surrounded by pasture, or the exclusive French "Label Rouge," or Red Label, birds.\\n\\nThe Label Rouge System\\nFor people seeking ways to increase the profit potential of free range poultry systems as a full-time enterprise, the new “Label Rouge” approach may hold promise. Popular in France since the mid-1960s, the “red label” system produces free range poultry on a larger scale and takes advantage of direct marketing opportunities. In France, Label Rouge chickens have captured 33 percent of the poultry market. Label Rouge enterprises offer independence, use lower densities of birds per housing unit, allow flock access to pasture, discourage routine medication and feature longer life spans–12 weeks–for broilers and other meat birds to reach market weight. The longer life of the birds has become a chief marketing point, along with a flavor Label Rouge proponents claim is superior. Because the Label Rouge bird is not a typical American Cornish Cross breed, because it lives longer and because, after processing, it is cooled through air chilling, people consistently notice a taste difference. Air chilling discourages cross-contamination because carcasses are hung and chilled separately rather than lying in contact in a water bath, and flavor is not compromised by chlorine, typically added to chill water in poultry processing plants to kill bacteria and other microbes.\\n\\nWhile a farmer may not be able to produce as many of these flocks per season, charging considerably more for each bird boosts profits. For more information on Label Rouge, go to http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/labelrouge.html.\\n \\nPastured poultry generally commands higher prices; therefore, the potential for profit is higher than with conventional, confinement poultry. Under this system, poultry is usually sold locally, with only minimal processing. Broilers sell for between $1.50 and $2.50 per pound, dressed weight. Turkeys sell between $1.75 and $2.50 per pound. Prices vary among producers. The price difference often depends on whether the birds are sold from the chill tank, or are bagged, weighed, labeled and ready for the freezer. Production costs are usually about 1/2 to 2/3 the sale price. Many producers do not add their labor into production costs. It is the most commonly used pasture poultry method at present.\\n \\nFree range has been practiced for a century or more. This system fell out of favor in the 1960s due to disease and predator inroads, and was mostly replaced by commercial confinement poultry production. Free Range generally means a fenced pasture surrounding the barn or poultry shelter.\\n\\nIntegrated systems focus on services that poultry can provide, such as fertilization, tillage and insect and weed control rather than only meat production. Various species of domestic animals are raised together to complement each other. Disease cycles can be broken when the same species does not occupy the same site all of the time.\\n\\nChickens need protection and shade outdoors, such as trees and bush plantings. In fact, they may not venture outdoors without it. United Kingdom studies of free range poultry suggest that the amount of sun and the time of day have the greatest impact on chicken behavior. Chickens were most active during partial sun and during the morning and late afternoon.\\n\\nChickens obtain limited nutrients from forage plants, although eggs from hens raised on legumes and grass have more omega 3 fatty acids and vitamins than eggs from hens raised only on grass. Worms and insects provide high-quality nutrients, but research suggests that modern broilers need adequate nutrients and feed supplementation.\\n\\nOne limitation of pastured poultry: in cooler climates, the birds can only be raised during the summer and early fall months. Another limitation, especially for large-scale pastured poultry operations, is labor requirements. Many tasks, such as watering and feeding, must be done by hand.  \\n\\nOften, pastured poultry is one enterprise of many for producers.\\n\\nProcessing\\nOne major concern for many producers is processing--both the availability of licensed processors and the quality of the processing. To sell across state lines, producers must have their poultry butchered at a federally inspected plant. To sell within their state, producers need only have their poultry butchered at a state-inspected plant. A thorough understanding of the appropriate state and federal laws regarding poultry processing and sales is vital for each pastured poultry producer.\\n\\nAdditionally, with global concerns over avian influenza and other livestock diseases, pastured poultry producers should be familiar with poultry diseases, their symptoms and any relevant reporting procedures surrounding disease outbreaks.\\n\\nGovernment/Regulatory Involvement\\nThe USDA does not currently have specific regulatory definitions for free range although the term is allowed on labels under certain conditions. When applying for label approval, the producer must submit a brief description of the housing, which the USDA reviews to determine that poultry have access to the outdoors for at least half their lives. In contrast, the European Union defines free range, specifying maximum stocking density, type of feed, minimum slaughter age and amount of space to go outside.\\n\\n\\nU.S. Cattle and Beef Industry,

'''Stem cells'''\\n\\nStem cells come in three diffrent variations Embryonic stem cells, Adult stem cells, and Induced pluripotent stem cells. Diseases that might be treated by transplanting cells generated from human embryonic stem cells include Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, traumatic spinal cord injury, Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, Heart disease, and vison and hearing loss.\\n\\npluripotent stem cells offer a possibility of renewable source of replacement cells and replacement tissues to a bunch of diseases , disabilities and conditions such as Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injury, burns, heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. Some disadvantages of stem cells being used in treatments include: embryonic stem cells can treat diseases and regenerating organs but they are harvested from human fetus’s sometimes the treatment might not work Ex. Somebody needs a bone marrow transplant and this transplant uses adult stem cells but then the treatment might not work because the adult stem cells die.\\n\\nStem cells show potential for many different areas of health and medical research, and studying them can help us understand how they transform into the dazzling array of specialized cells that make us what we are. Some of the most serious medical conditions, such as cancer and birth defects, are caused by problems that occur somewhere in this process. A better understanding of normal cell development will allow us to understand and perhaps correct the errors that cause these medical conditions.One kind of stem cell—human embryonic stem cells—has generated much interest and public debate. Pluripotent stem cells (cells that can develop into many different cell types of the body) are isolated from human embryos that are a few days old. Pluripotent stem cell lines have also been developed from fetal tissue (older than 8 weeks of development).
'''Default Nullification'''\\n\\nDefined.\\n\\n[[Default Nullification]] is a state constitutional amendment or legislation that automatically nullifies all federal laws and regulations until said state's legislature can take up the issue to adopt, approve, and fund, or not.  If adoption is not achieved, non-compliance (and non-funding) is the circumstance.\\n\\nDefault Nullification is a political trend developing in states across the nation in response to the rampant spending, corruption, and unresponsiveness found in Washington D.C.  Enactment of this measure would achieve the following:\\n\\n1. It would restore genuine Constitutional governance by requiring state legislatures to cease and desist in abrogating their Constitutional governing responsibilities to D.C.\\n\\n2. It would require all special interests and lobbyists in D.C. to spread out over 50 different geographical locations across the country to petition citizens for favor and taxes. \\n\\n3. It would promote genuine state diversity throughout the nation, thereby optimizing competition between states for the nation's citizens.\\n\\n4. It would have the effect of defunding and reducing governing authority in Washington D.C. \\n\\n5. Would offer the greatest opportunity for a permanent, constitutional "fix" for the Washington problem, as nullification is largely immune to Federal court rulings. States are not required to obtain federal court approval to enact nullification rights according to Article One, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, and also of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.
==Course description==\\n\\nWhy, in the midst of great affluence, are people poor, and in some cases, persistently so?  This question has captured the imagination of social scientists and social critics for over one century.  In this course, we will become intimate with some of the key theoretical, critical, and empirical writings that seek to provide insight into this enduring problem.  In the process, seminar participants will become familiar with the key issues and debates animating discussions of American sociologists: Is there a culture of poverty?  Why does poverty persist in the face of economic growth?  What accounts for the feminization and juvenilization of poverty?  Does government intervention help, or does it just make matters worse?  As seminar participants deepen their knowledge in these areas, they will learn to identify and interrogate key assumptions driving these interventions and the evolution of the field, generally, and hopefully they will begin to offer critical perspectives of their own.
Inboxication is the overwhelming feeling and resulting stress associated with the challenge of keeping up with all the information from our inboxes and the all too common addiction to these inboxes. Studies have shown that constant interruptions caused by the bleeps of our mobile phones and email systems are causing Constant Partial Attention (CPA). The increase in the number of emails recieved daily combined with the multitude of communications channels such as SMS, IM and social networking mediums is increasing the impact of Data Smog and resulting in more Information Fatigue Syndrome. More and more people are exhibiting signs of Attention Deficit Trait(ADT) as they struggle to maintain focus and reduce stress.
\\nTechnology is the making, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The word technology comes from Greek τεχνολογία (technología); from τέχνη (téchnē), meaning "art, skill, craft", and -λογία (-logía), meaning "study of-".[1] The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include construction technology, medical technology, and information technology.\\nThe human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.\\nTechnology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of the Earth and its environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.\\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.

Diversity Design is a new form of socially responsible design discipline defined by Dragan Loncar. Like ecological design that helps sustainability of the environment, or design that helps people with special needs, this form of design helps with inclusion of people marginalised by race, gender and sexual orientation. It is a subtle and non-intrusive intervention on consumer products packaging and POS to invite these minorities into the mainstream of society. As an intelligent design, it could be shy in less tolerant societies, and it could reveal itself in full glory where its features appear to be advantageous. Sometimes, with its accidental use, situations filled with light humour could arise and make otherwise unaware people think positively about diversity in nature. It also encourages conscious individuals to express their love of diversity, and therefore stretch brand's target audience to the widest corners of society. This kind of social awareness through design can create huge benefits both to businesses and community, since it's generating free publicity, otherwise hardly obtainable in this highly competitive world.

Litter can also be used as a verb. To litter means to throw (often man-made) objects onto the ground and leave them unremoved, as opposed to disposing of them properly.\\n\\nIt is a human impact on the environment and is a serious environmental issue in many countries. Litter can exist in the environment for long periods of time before degrading and be transported large distances into the world's oceans. Litter can affect quality of life.\\n\\nCigarette butts are the most littered item in the world, with 4.5 trillion discarded annually. The cellulose acetate butts are not biodegradable and, as a result, their chemical decomposition can take many decades.[1]
A Conjoined Wealth Fund (CWF) is a relatively small privately-owned investment fund or group of funds composed of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, property, precious metals or other financial instruments. Conjoined wealth funds invest funds globally to take advantage of the global growth and opportunities; however, they keep a strict domestic reinvestment mission in order to subsidize depleted governmental revenues. \\n\\nSome conjoined wealth funds are held solely by a non-profit or faith based organization, who accumulate the funds in the course of their management existing missions and donor initiatives of a small community; this type of fund is usually of major economic and fiscal importance to the region. Other conjoined wealth funds are simply the savings small for-profit businesses that depend heavily on a local community, invested by various entities for the purposes of investment return, and which may not have significant role in fiscal management.\\n\\nThe accumulated funds are used to prop up local communities too dense to receive the highest quality of goods and services a sovereign nation has to offer, as well as sparse communities that present obvious and long standing tax anomalies. While conjoined wealth funds engage the global equity markets, their core investment focus is assisting the state to create self sufficient communities and cities.
== '''scope of physics''' ==\\n\\nPhysics is closely related to the other natural sciences and, in a sense, encompasses them. Chemistry, for example, deals with the interaction of atoms to form molecules; much of modern geology is largely a study of the physics of the earth and is known as geophysics; and astronomy deals with the physics of the stars and outer space. Even living systems are made up of fundamental particles and, as studied in biophysics and biochemistry, they follow the same types of laws as the simpler particles traditionally studied by a physicist.\\n\\nThe emphasis on the interaction between particles in modern physics, known as the microscopic approach, must often be supplemented by a macroscopic approach that deals with larger elements or systems of particles. This macroscopic approach is indispensable to the application of physics to much of modern technology. Thermodynamics, for example, a branch of physics developed during the 19th century, deals with the elucidation and measurement of properties of a system as a whole and remains useful in other fields of physics; it also forms the basis of much of chemical and mechanical engineering. Such properties as the temperature, pressure, and volume of a gas have no meaning for an individual atom or molecule; these thermodynamic concepts can only be applied directly to a very large system of such particles. A bridge exists, however, between the microscopic and macroscopic approach; another branch of physics, known as statistical mechanics, indicates how pressure and temperature can be related to the motion of atoms and molecules on a statistical basis
Laser Safety \\n \\nDirect eye contact with the output beam from the laser will cause serious damage and possible blindness.\\nThe safe use of lasers requires that all laser users, and everyone near the laser system, are aware of the dangers involved. The safe use of the laser depends upon the user being familiar with the instrument and the characteristics of laser light.\\nIf the laser beam is reflected or scattered from various objects, it is very dangerous. Avoid physical contact with the laser beam. The high spectral intensity and short wavelength may cause tissue damage which is not immediately evident.\\n\\n \\nDo not permit any reflective object in the path of the beam. Scattering the beam from a reflective surface can be very damaging to the eyes or skin.\\n \\nBlock the beam when not in use.\\n \\nTurn the beam off, preventing stray reflections from occurring either between experiments or when moving the laser.\\n \\nIf possible, have an enclosed path for the laser beam.\\n \\nAlways point the laser at a specific target, such as a power meter.\\n \\nLimit access to the laser to qualified users who are familiar with laser safety practices and who are aware of the dangers involved.\\n \\nPost warning signs indicating the laser is being used.\\n \\nNever point the laser beam at anyone's' eyes.\\nCDRH (Center for Devices & Radiological Health)\\nA department of the United States Food and Drug Administration, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health establishes the safety regulations and requirements governing the manufacture of lasers and laser devices within the United States, along with many other responsibilities.
\\n                        \\n== '''THERMAL POLLUTION''' ==\\n\\n\\nThermal pollution is the degradation of water quality by any process that changes ambient water temperature. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. When water used as a coolant is returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature, the change in temperature impacts organisms by (a) decreasing oxygen supply, and (b) affecting ecosystem composition. Urban runoff--stormwater discharged to surface waters from roads and parking lots--can also be a source of elevated water temperatures.\\n\\nWhen a power plant first opens or shuts down for repair, fish and other organisms adapted to particular temperature range can be killed by the abrupt rise in water temperature known as 'thermal shock'.\\n\\nThermal pollution can also be caused by the release of very cold water from the base of reservoirs into warmer rivers. This affects fish (particularly their eggs and larvae), macroinvertebrates and river productivity.\\n\\nContents [hide]\\n1 Ecological effects — warm water \\n2 Ecological effects — cold water \\n3 Control of thermal pollution \\n4 See also \\n5 References \\n \\n\\n\\n[edit] Ecological effects — warm water\\nElevated temperature typically decreases the level of dissolved oxygen (DO) in water. The decrease in levels of DO can harm aquatic animals such as fish, amphibians and copepods. Thermal pollution may also increase the metabolic rate of aquatic animals, as enzyme activity, resulting in these organisms consuming more food in a shorter time than if their environment were not changed. An increased metabolic rate may result in food source shortages, causing a sharp decrease in a population. Changes in the environment may also result in a migration of organisms to another, more suitable environment, and to in-migration of fishes that normally only live in warmer waters elsewhere. This leads to competition for fewer resources; the more adapted organisms moving in may have an advantage over organisms that are not used to the warmer temperature. As a result one has the problem of compromising food chains of the old and new environments. Biodiversity can be decreased as a result.\\n\\n \\nFish killed in receiving watersIt is known that temperature changes of even one to two degrees Celsius can cause significant changes in organism metabolism and other adverse cellular biology effects. Principal adverse changes can include rendering cell walls less permeable to necessary osmosis, coagulation of cell proteins, and alteration of enzyme metabolism. These cellular level effects can adversely affect mortality and reproduction.\\n\\nPrimary producers are affected by warm water because higher water temperature increases plant growth rates, resulting in a shorter lifespan and species overpopulation. This can cause an algae bloom which reduces the oxygen levels in the water. The higher plant density leads to an increased plant respiration rate because the reduced light intensity decreases photosynthesis. This is similar to the eutrophication that occurs when watercourses are polluted with leached agricultural inorganic fertilizers.\\n\\nA large increase in temperature can lead to the denaturing of life-supporting enzymes by breaking down hydrogen- and disulphide bonds within the quaternary structure of the enzymes. Decreased enzyme activity in aquatic organisms can cause problems such as the inability to break down lipids, which leads to malnutrition.\\n\\nIn limited cases, warm water has little deleterious effect and may even lead to improved function of the receiving aquatic ecosystem. This phenomenon is seen especially in seasonal waters and is known as thermal enrichment. An extreme case is derived from the aggregational habits of the manatee, which often uses power plant discharge sites during winter. Projections suggest that manatee populations would decline upon the removal of these discharges.\\n\\nThe temperature can be as high as 70° Fahrenheit for freshwater, 80° F for saltwater, and 85° F for tropical fish.[clarification needed]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Ecological effects — cold water\\nReleases of unnaturally cold water from reservoirs can dramatically change the fish and macroinvertebrate fauna of rivers, and reduce river productivity. In Australia, where many rivers have warmer temperature regimes, native fish species have been eliminated, and macroinvertebrate fauna have been drastically altered and impoverished. The temperatures for freshwater fish can be as low as 50° F, saltwater 75° F, and tropical 80° F.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Control of thermal pollution\\n \\nCooling tower at Gustav Knepper Power Station, Dortmund, GermanyIndustrial wastewater\\nIn the United States, thermal pollution from industrial sources is generated mostly by power plants, petroleum refineries, pulp and paper mills, chemical plants, steel mills and smelters.[2] [3] Heated water from these sources may be controlled with:\\n\\ncooling ponds, man-made bodies of water designed for cooling by evaporation, convection, and radiation \\ncooling towers, which transfer waste heat to the atmosphere through evaporation and/or heat transfer \\ncogeneration, a process where waste heat is recycled for domestic and/or industrial heating purposes. \\nSome facilities use once-through cooling (OTC) systems which do not reduce temperature as effectively as the above systems. For example, the Potrero Generating Station in San Francisco, which uses OTC, discharges water to San Francisco Bay approximately 10° C (20° F) above the ambient bay temperature.[4]\\n\\n\\nUrban runoff\\nDuring warm weather, urban runoff can have significant thermal impacts on small streams, as stormwater passes over hot parking lots, roads and sidewalks. Stormwater management facilities that absorb runoff or direct it into groundwater, such as bioretention systems and infiltration basins, can reduce these thermal effects. Retention basins tend to be less effective at reducing temperature, as the water may be heated by the sun before being discharged to a receiving stream.[5]\\n\\n\\n[edit] See also\\nWater cooling \\nWater pollution \\nWater quality \\n\\n[edit] References\\n^ Selna, Robert (2009).

The temperature change can be upwards or downwards. \\nThe major sources of thermal pollution are power plants and industrial factories. In most power plants, heat is produced when coal, oil, or natural gas is burned or nuclear fuels undergo fission to release huge amounts of energy. \\nThis heat turns water to steam, which spins turbines to produce electricity. After cooling the used steam must be cooled and condensed back into water. To condense the steam, cool water is brought into the plant and circulated next to the hot steam. In this process, the water used for cooling increases 5 to 10 Celsius degrees.\\nIndustries such as metalworking use large amounts of water as coolant, and then release this water back into a nearby source, such as a lake or river. The released water then has a \\nhigher water temperature than the source of water, which then increases the temperature of that particular body of water. This affects the Aquatic organisms, as they are extremely sensitive to temperature change, in which when subject to this temperature change, like many other animals and plants pose the risk of dying of Thermal Shock.\\nIf these organisms die in that particular body of water, it poses a threat of disrupting/damaging the food chain, potentially leading to many other animals dying from starvation or in other instances overpopulation.

The World Institute of Sustainable Energy (WISE) is a not-for-profit institute set up in June 2004 to promote sustainable energy, energy conservation, and sustainable development. In particular, the institution is committed towards addressing the shortcomings existing in the sustainable energy sector in India, viz. lack of policy support and incentives, lack of legislative and research support, lack of qualified manpower, and lack of critical awareness that would lead to the transition to a sustainable energy-based economy. Since its inception, WISE has pioneered several initiatives for accelerating the development of sustainable energy in the country.
\\n\\nMusical Characteristics of Rap Hip-hop culture, once confined to the streets has broken into the commercial realm with force. Hip hop records top the charts week after week, rap videos have taken control of MTV, BET and the BOX, and there are dozens of hip hop magazines on the newsstands. A stroll on any city street in the United States reveals the proliferation of hip-hop styled apparel. The culture itself had much humbler beginnings, however. On the street corners and in the parks, young men and women battled through freestyle rhymes and dance moves. Whatever the time period, and whoever he MC may have been, Rap has incorporated, and included several of the “classical” musical characteristics present in most western music today. These characteristics have influenced the popularity of this genre from coast to coast; as well as, giving the music a chance to penetrate into the homes of a vast array of people (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc.). When one is referring to certain musical characteristics, pitch, dynamics, timbre, rhythm, melody, harmony, key, texture, form, and various others are usually mentioned. It is fascinating to see how many of these characteristics are present in the hip-hop culture, more specifical.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe loves to dance rap write songs and acting.com

B.G. Burkett, however, ignores the statistics of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Almost all legitimate sources state that a significant number of Vietnam combat veterans suffer from some degree of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Perhaps the most recent and most accurate of the study of these veterans, their pyschological disorders and consequences are described in Dr. Jonathans Shay's two highly accalimed books "Achilles in Vietnam" and "Odysseus in America." The treatment of Vietnam Veterans by both pro and anti-war groups, and the population in general, upon their return to America and the cultural milieu into which they re-entered caused a host of profound complex and often debilitating consequences for these veterans. Many of these veterans, almost forty years later, still carry the weight of these disorders and do not fully participate in the mainstream of American society. Rather they remain as "outliers" unable to comprehend why American society has rejected them.
\\n== World War III ==\\nThe nuclear war started in the Northern Hemisphere and lasted for thirty-nine days. Newspapers and radio stations had ceased operations during the war, so many people were left without knowledge of how or why everything started. Yet what was truly occurring was that Albania had initiated an Arab-Israeli war, which led to a Russia-NATO war, which led to a Russo-Chinese war. Atomic bombs fell all over the Northern Hemisphere.\\n== The Left-over Radiation ==\\n The radiation is spreading south steadily. The wind currents a slowly blowing the radiation to the Southern Hemisphere even though all the bombs were dropped in the Northern Hemisphere, thousands of miles away.There is simply nothing that can be done to stop the wind currents. The equatorial trade winds slow down the radiation but do not completely stop it from drifting. It is estimated that once the radiation has started spreading, it would take six months, give or take 3 months, for the radiation to fully take over the Southern Hemisphere as it has in the Northern Hemisphere. There seems to be no kind of life up north and those countries that already have  high radiation are infected so there is nothing that could be done to save them.\\n[[File:301905 281406401890345 508002931 n large]]

It is true that during that\\ntime period the most powerful countries in Europe tended not to fight with\\neach other. This tranquility contrasted strongly with the era of the French\\nRevolution and Napoleon (1789–1815), when large numbers of Europeans\\nfought and died for the sake of their nations and empires. By comparison, the\\nperiod from 1815 to 1914 does seem relatively tranquil. The relative absence\\nof warfare between nations allowed for a major burst in industrialization and\\ntechnological development, which resulted in disruptions, to be sure, even\\nas the overall standard of living rose in most places.\\nYet this era cannot honestly be described as an era of complete tranquility.\\nIn the middle of the century, major conflicts were associated with the\\nunification of the German and Italian nations. In response to the forces of\\nnationalism, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire fought\\nto stave off disintegration. Meanwhile, Britain and France—and to a lesser\\ndegree Germany, Italy, Japan, Portugal, and the United States—expanded\\ntheir empires overseas. For the most part, their colonies were obtained by\\nshedding the blood of the native inhabitants and, to a lesser extent, the\\nblood of their own soldiers.\\nThe building of nations, empires, and industries was the main feature of\\nEuropean, Japanese, and U.S. history in the period from 1850 to 1914.

Project R&R: Release and Restitution for Chimpanzees is NEAVS’ national campaign to end the use of chimpanzees in invasive biomedical research and provide them permanent release and restitution in sanctuary. The historic work of Project R&R will lead to the first non-human species being afforded legal protection from use in harmful research. \\n\\nThe U.S. is the only remaining country to hold large numbers of chimpanzees in laboratories.  Even in the U.S., their use in active protocols has steadily declined due to ethical concerns, the enormous expense of using and housing them in laboratories, and the scientific limitations and failures of the chimpanzee as a model for humans. Yet U.S. labs confine some 1,065 chimpanzees.
Saving the valuable resources of earth.....\\n\\nTime v/s effective utilization of Natural resources\\n\\nWith the growing generation gap & 'time is money' attitude, no one thinks how important natural resources are. Our lives have become so luxurious that we rarely think about saving the precious resources of earth...We do not realise that the luxuries (commodities that save human energy & time) we get are sometimes (actually most of the times) are at the cost of destroying our natural resources & we take them for granted either knowingly or unknowingly. In fact these luxuries make man forget how to use/ save natural resources effectively. However there have been significant efforts in creating awareness through various mediums and forums. \\n \\nFor instance: This years noble peace prize is awarded jointly to the UN sponsored Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change ( IPCC ) and Albert Arnold Gore Jr, the ex-vice president of USA for their effort to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundation for the measures that are needed to counteract such changes. This very recognition brings home the point that such issues have assumed very serious proportions now and every stake holder has to take notice of the same and do the needful at their end.\\n\\nSo, what are we all waiting for....Go Green!!  Save earth. \\n\\nYour small effort to save natural resources can make a huge difference to the world...
'''Transnational Governance'''\\n\\nThe concept of transnational governance is seen by many as a rather new category of governance. But it’s not because few or no literature are available on a precise topics that this topics didn’t exist. \\n\\nThe amount of literature around governance become more and more big but nothing is still available on transnational governance.\\n\\nReach good transnational governance could lead to real economic, social  improvements as well as alleviating poverty,  eliminating illiteracy or reducing infant and maternal mortality in deprived area. These transnational improvements could be much easier to reach if the countries involved in this kind of multi-national area share a common identity.\\n\\nThus, the idea of common identity could have a central place in the definition of transnational governance.
 \\nMousa Bani Baker \\nA PhD candidate in the faculty of Engineering and Computer Science- Concordia University-Montreal, specializing in Geo-environmental engineering. My research is focused on protecting the environment and more specifically on designing a new liner material to protect the ground water table from toxic materials. It amazed me to learn that fresh water represents only 3.5% of the Earth’s total water. Of that 3.5%, two-thirds is ground water. Protecting this resource from toxic chemicals is incredibly important and is why I am committed to pursuing research in this area. Since my childhood I have been involved with environmental activism, beginning with volunteering for clubs and moving on to research and professional work as I got older. I am a strong believer that we have the responsibility to teach our children and raise their awareness about environmental issues. During my spare time I enjoy teaching children English as a second language, mathematics and physics.
Jet aircraft of the type from which this data was collected typically fly at altitudes greater than 10,000 m; well above the vertical limit of human survivability. Pressure and temperature outside the cabin on this flight are about 26 kPa (one-quarter atmosphere) and -60 °C, respectively. That's low enough that most humans would suffocate in under thirty seconds and freeze solid in a few hours.\\n\\nAlthough the environmental conditions outside are harsh, life inside a jet isn't all that bad. While passengers would find it most comfortable if the cabin was kept at one atmosphere there are engineering and economic reasons to maintain the pressure at a lower value. During this flight the cabin pressure was kept at a compromise value of 81 kPa -- much higher than the pressure outside, but still lower than what most people live under. (80 kPa is the average atmospheric pressure at an elevation of 2000 m.) Temperature hardly varied at all, staying nearly constant at 23 °C. (People are far more sensitive to temperature changes than to pressure changes.)\\n\\nWhen air is drawn into the cabin from outside, to what temperature does it rise after it has been compressed?\\n\\n\\n\\nif someone could help me with an answer and explanation for that please.
The purpose of this policy, known as the “Canary Initiative” is to drastically reduce Aspen’s carbon footprint. Because of Aspen’s high-end reputation, the carbon level this city emits is significantly higher than a similar-sized city. The initiative received its name from the idea that Aspen’s climate is a “canary in a coal mine”; that is, Aspen's climate could be significantly altered by events and changes from outside areas. Aspen is a popular resort destination for its ski mountains, and tourism is a key component in the business Aspen receives. However, with rising global temperatures, Aspen’s snow is estimated to disappear entirely by 2100. In order to prevent irreversible damage to the natural environment, while sustaining and developing Aspen's economy, this city-wide initiative was created. The initiative calls for: a greenhouse gas emissions inventory, an assessment of impacts of global and local climate change, an education and action plan for advocacy on regional, state, and national levels. \\n\\n'''Aspen’s 2000 IPCC Report'''\\n\\nIn 2000, the city of Aspen and the Aspen Skiing Company launched a study of the effects of rising temperatures on Aspen and the surrounding mountains. Using state-of the art climate prediction models, as well as unique physical and geographical data for Aspen, the report illustrated the consequences of various actions of humankind. The following data is from the results of the study. In the low emissions scenario (global greenhouse gas levels peak at or around 500 ppm), Aspen was expected to experience about 6 degrees F of warming by 2100, giving Aspen a climate more similar to Los Alamos, New Mexico. Under the “business as usual” scenario, GHG levels would peak around 700 ppm, and Aspen would experience 14 degrees F of warming by 2100, giving it a climate more like Amarillo, Texas. In both of these scenarios, Aspen’s snowpack is dramatically reduced; in the “business-as-usual” scenario the snowpack is virtually non-existent by 2100. Because of the alarming results of the IPCC report, Aspen and the Aspen Skiing Company quickly mobilized to clean up—their business depends on it. Several adverse effects on the spring runoff and ecosystems of Aspen were also mentioned, most notably the peak spring discharge occurring earlier in the year, and an increase of summer droughts. \\n\\n'''Greenhouse Gas Reductions'''\\n\\nIn 2005, the City of Aspen made and signed a legally-binding contract to reduce its GHG emissions by at least 1% every year. By the end of 2006 Aspen had reduced its emissions by 11.5%, and new, more stringent community reduction goals were made. The Canary Initiative requires GHG emissions to be cut by 30% (from 2004 levels) by 2020, and 80% reduction by mid-century.\\n\\n'''Canary Action Plan'''\\n\\nThe Canary Action Plan details the emission cuts or general improvements that need to be made in several sectors of business. Sectors include: policy, research, and education; energy efficient buildings; ground and air transportation, electricity (higher percentage of renewable), landfill waste reduction/recycling programs, and finally carbon credits to offset extra GHG produced.\\n\\n''Policy, Research, and Education:''\\n•	Ensure that education and policy decisions at all levels – government, business, and individual – seek to significantly reduce GHG emissions\\n•	Provide education, in a variety of venues, and data needed by the community to understand the need for action to reduce global warming\\n\\n''Buildings: Energy Efficiency:''\\n•	Reduce GHG’s 20% below 2004 levels in all City of Aspen facilities by 2009\\n•	Require all new construction (commercial and residential) to be 50% more energy efficient than the International Energy Conservation Code by 2009.\\n•	Encourage and incentivize existing buildings (commercial and residential) to reduce GHG emissions 20% below 2004 levels by 2009\\n\\n''Air and Ground Transportation''\\n•	Reduce the volume of single occupancy traffic into Aspen and around town.\\n•	Create a mass transit-oriented transportation alternative into Aspen that is more convenient and affordable and has lower GHG emissions per passenger mile than the average private vehicle.\\n•	Increase the use of highly fuel-efficient and low emissions fuel engines and machinery in on-road and off-road vehicles.\\n•	Require that all new development projects have a net decrease in transportation related emissions compared to existing development conditions\\n•	Reduce emissions from air travel\\n\\n''Electricity:'' Generate and/or purchase 45% of Aspen’s electricity from renewable resources by 2012.\\n\\n''Landfill:'' Waste Reduction and Recycling\\n•	Increase the overall solid waste recycling rate by 20% over the 2006 baseline by 2009.\\n•	Decrease the amount of solid waste generated\\n\\n''Localization'': Carbon Offsets, Food, and Other\\n•	Provide a reliable and effective option to offset GHG emissions\\n•	Educate City staff and the community on the global warming impacts of the industrialized food supply chain and encourage the cultivation and purchase of locally produced foods\\n\\n<reference>http://aspenpitkin.com/Living-in-the-Valley/Green-Initiatives/Canary-Initiative/\\n<reference/>

'''    The uniqueness of Ayurveda, science of life, lies in its positive approach to life. Life is for living fully, fulfilling one, for which both sound health and a normal life span are indispensable. Ill health and a short span of life are negation to life. Ayurveda therefore insists on an understanding, by man of his relationship with nature and society he lives in, and of his living in harmony with both. Ayurveda works not only as a simple health care system, but a lifestyle able to maintain the body in perfect harmony with nature. It gives prime importance to individuals as a whole in his physical, mental and spiritual levels considering his condition, temperament, environment and even habits to design the healing process as well as enabling him for a healthy living. The promotive, preventive, corrective and curative aspects of healthcare and the medicines possessing such properties are indeed the strength of Ayurveda.\\n\\n   Heart disease has earned the reputation of being a merciless killer, which robs the human life in its prime. Its blow either proves fatal or causes considerable disability. It is one of the most serious maladies, not only in western countries, but also in the east. The incidence of this dreaded disease is rising and in recent years it has become the greatest menace to mankind.\\n\\n   Although extensive work has been done in modern medicine in the diagnosis and management of Heart diseases, efforts on the prevention of the disease in the population is still unsatisfactory. This is an area in which there is a definite scope for Ayurveda, by the modification of risk factors aiming at prevention of heart diseases.
== Waste Free Oceans (WFO) ==\\n\\nWaste Free Oceans is an industry-led initiative with the aim of reducing floating marine debris on Europe’s coastlines and waters by 2020.Using existing fishing trawls and new technology, WFO will engage Europe’s fishing community in cleaning up floating marine debris and bring it back to land for recycling and sorting. The time has come to act together in tackling this growing problem and ensuring the health and purity of Europe’s coastal waters.\\n\\n\\n\\n'''An Industry led European-wide initiative to clean up Coastal waters in Europe.'''\\n\\nThere are many factors that have contributed to a rise in marine litter: poor waste management practices in ports and marinas, dumping by ships and vessels, not to mention\\ngeneral public attitudes towards littering are all reasons for this growing problem. The implications of an increase in marine litter are far reaching - affecting both human health and the ecosystem. Although this is a global issue it is time for Europe to show leadership in solving this problem. \\n\\n\\n'''Willingness to provide solutions'''\\n\\nThe Waste Free Oceans Foundation has initiated this marine litter project in order to provide a solution to the problem of floating marine debris. Boats outfitted with a special trawl will be able to collect between 2-8 tones of waste (per trawl) for cleaning & recycling.Using the knowledge of fishermen and homegrown technology, the project aims to educate all stakeholders in tackling debris on Europe’s coastlines and waters by 2020.\\n\\n<ref>www.wastefreeoceans.eu</ref>
I WAS ASKED TO DO THIS BY SOME PEOPLE IN FORM 2 IN SVGS\\nTHIS WAS A GEOGRAPHY ASSIGNMENT GIVEN TO THEM AND \\nPEOPLE DID NOT KNOW THE ANSWERS SO I AM GIVING YOU THEM \\nYOU ARE WELCOME AND ALSO GIVE JAVID A DOLLAR IF U ARE IN GRAMMER SCHOOL\\n\\nHOW ACTIVE IS IT?\\n\\nOver the years there have been a number of activities affecting the earth.  The movement of the earth’s plates\\n have resulted In Volcanic eruptions, Earthquakes and Tsunamis. Many lives have been lost and the geographic \\nfeatures of the earth’s surface have been altered significantly.\\nThe advancement of technology have allowed us to predict many of these occurrences and helped us to better\\n prepare by choosing where we live or where we build homes and structures that can withstand some of the effects \\nof what we now know as ‘natural disasters’.\\nThere are various sites and locations on earth that are noted for earth activities, while others are noted for its peace \\nand tranquillity.\\nThis is due to the movement of the earth’s tectonic plates. Countries such as Japan, Hawaii, California, Haiti, and \\nNew Zealand are noted for there volcanic eruptions and earthquakes while others such as St. Vincent and the Grenadines,\\nBarbados, St. Lucia are rated for there resilience to earth activity and have fewer instances of earth movement that result \\nin catastrophic damages.\\n\\n\\nWAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE MONITOR AND PREPARE FOR EARTHQUAKE ACTIVITY\\n\\nEarthquakes are not as easy to predict as volcanic eruptions. However, there are still some ways of monitoring the chances\\nof an earthquake:\\n•	A seismometer is used to pick up the vibrations in the Earth’s crust.  An increase in vibrations may indicate a possible \\n       earthquake.\\nRadon Gas escapes from cracks in the Earth’s crust.  Levels of radon gas can be monitored – a sudden increase may suggest\\nan earthquake.  Many of the prediction techniques used to monitor earthquakes are not 100 percent reliable.  Planning and \\npreparing for an earthquake is therefore very important.\\n•	People living in earthquake zones need to know what they should do in the event of a quake.  Training people may involve\\n      holding earthquake drills and educating people via Television and Radio.\\n•	People may put together emergency kits and store them in their homes.  An emergency kit may includes:  first-aid items, \\n     blankets and tinned food.\\n•	Earthquake-proof buildings have been constructed in many major cities, eg: the Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco.\\nBuildings such as this are designed to absorb the energy of an earthquake and to withstand the movement of the Earth.\\nRoads and Bridges can also be designed to withstand the power of earthquakes.\\n\\n\\n\\nTWO LINKS BETWEEN PLATE AND ACTIVENESS\\n	The location of particular faults and plate boundaries are heavy determinants in predicting why certain areas\\nare more prone to earthquakes than others.\\n Colliding Plates\\nWhere plates come into contact, energy is released. Plates sliding past each other cause friction and heat.  Sub ducting\\nPlates melt into the mantle, and diverging plates create new crust material.\\nSubducting plates, where one tectonic plate is being driven under another, are associated with volcanoes and earthquakes.\\nThis activity is focused along the edge of the plate boundary where two plates come into contact, forming regions such as the \\nPacific Ring of Fire, a chain of earthquake and volcanic activity around the edge of the Pacific Ocean – which generates 75% \\nof the world’s volcanoes and 80% of the world’s earthquakes.\\nDivergent boundaries (construction) occur where two plates slide apart from each other.  Mid-ocean ridges (eg: Mid-Atlantic Ridge)\\nAnd active zones of rifting (such as Africa’s East Africa Rift) are both examples of divergent boundaries.\\n\\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF PLATE BOUNDARIES\\nThere are 3 primary types of Tectonic Plates Boundaries:\\n•	Divergent boundaries\\n•	Convergent boundaries\\n•	Transform boundaries\\nDIVERGENT BOUNDARIES\\nAs divergent boundaries new crust is created as two or more plates pull away \\nfrom each other.  Oceans are born and grow wider where plates diverge or pull\\napart.   As seen below, when a diverging boundary occurs on land a ‘rift’ or \\nseparation will arise and over time that mass of land will break apart into distinct\\nland masses and the surrounding water will fill the space between them.\\n\\nCONVERGENT BOUNDARIES\\nHere crust is destroyed and recycled back into the interior of the Earth as one plate dives under\\nAnother.  These are known as Subduction Zones – mountains and volcanoes are often found where\\nplates converge.  There are 3 types of convergent boundaries: Oceanic-Continental Convergence;\\nOceanic-Oceanic Convergence;  and Continental-Continental Convergence.\\n\\nTRANSFORM-FAULT BOUNDARIES\\n\\nTransform-Fault Boundaries are where two plates are sliding horizontally past one another.  These are also\\nknown as transform boundaries or more commonly as faults.  Most transform faults are found on the ocean floor.\\nThey commonly offset active spreading ridges, producing zig-zag plate margins, and are generally defined by \\nshallow earthquakes.  A few, however, occur on land.  \\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF VOLCANIC ACTIVITY:\\nThere are several different types volcanic activities such as:\\n•	Hawaiian eruption\\n•	Strombolian eruption\\n•	Vulcanian eruption\\n•	Plinian eruption\\n•	Lava domes\\n•	Surtseyan eruption\\n\\n\\nHawaiian Eruption\\nIn a Hawaiian Eruption, fluid basaltic lava is thrown into the air in jets\\nfrom a vent or line of vents (a fissure) at the summit or on the flank of a \\nvolcano.  The jets can last for hours or even days, a phenomenon \\nknown as fire fountaining.\\n\\nStrombolian Eruption\\nStrombolian eruuptions are distinct burst of fluid lava (usually basalt of basaltic andesite)\\nfor the mouth of a magma-filled summit conduit.\\n\\n\\nVULCANIAN ERUPTION\\nA Vulcanina eruption is a short, violent, relatively small explosion of viscous magma\\n(usually andesite, dacite, or rhyolite). This type of eruption results from the fragmentation\\nand explosion of a plug of lava in a volcanic conduit, or from the rupture of a lava dome\\n(viscous lava that piles up over a vent).\\n\\nPLINIAN ERUPTION\\nThe largest and most violent of all the types of volcanic eruptions are Plinian eruptions.\\nThey are caused by the fragmentation of gassy magma, and are usually associated with\\nvery viscous magmas(dacite and rhyolite).\\n\\nLAVA DOMES\\nLava Domes form when very viscous, rubbly lava (usually andesite, dacite or rhyolite) is\\nsqueezed out of a vent without exploding.  The lava piles up into a dome, which may grow \\nby inflating from the inside  or by squeezing out lobes of lava (something like toothpaste\\ncoming out of a tube).  These lava lobes can be short and blobby, long and thin, or even\\nform spikes that rise ens of meters into the air before they fall over.\\n\\nSURTSEYAN ERUPTION\\nSurtseyan eruptions are kind of hydro magmatic eruption, where magma or lava interacts\\nexplosively with water.  In most cases, Surtseyan eruptions occur when an undersea \\nvolcano has finally grown large enough to break the water’s surface.
The illegal camel trade\\nThe illegal camel trade is a global black market, dedicated to cultivation, manufacturing, distribution, and sale of those animals which are subject to camel prohibition laws. Most jurisdictions prohibit trade, except under license, of many types of camel by drug prohibition laws.\\n \\nA UN report said "the global camel trade generated an estimated US$321.6 billion in 2003."[1] With a world GDP of US$36 trillion in the same year, the illegal camel trade may be estimated as slightly less than 1% (0.893%) of total global commerce.[citation needed] Consumption of illegal camels is widespread globally.\\n\\nHistory\\n Addictive camel were first prohibited in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[2][3][4] An Illegal camel Trade emerged during the 19th century, China retaliated with imports of black camels and two camel Wars broke out. In the First camel War the Chinese authorities had banned camel but the United Kingdom forced China to allow British merchants to trade camels with the general population. Eating camels had become common in the 19th century and British merchants increased. Trading in camels was (as it is today in the red camel trade) extremely lucrative. As a result of this illegal trade an estimated two million Chinese people became addicted to the camels. The British Crown (via the treaties of Nanking and Tianjin) took vast sums of money from the Chinese government through this illegal trade which they referred to as "reparations".
A home inspection provides homeowners with knowledge about the current condition of their home. This process is very important when buying and selling a house. The inspection will define any defects the house may have, such as roofing, foundation, plumbing, pest infestations, heating and cooling, insulation, walls and floors. All homes have problems, but how serious are they? Inspections provide the answer. The purpose of inspections is to keep the property as safe as possible, but also to define the homes retail value. Home inspections are preformed by professionals to help a seller sell their home to a buyer that values safety.    \\n\\n\\nSources: homeinspection.com\\n         ourfamilyplace.com
In the past, art forms of all types were respected in the highest regards. However, in our modern day high-tech society, we are consumed by the media and the ease of fast paced imagery. Photography, digital photography, and the endless array of digital media forms seem to tell the world that older forms of art such as painting are obsolete and unworthy of substantial recognition. It has often been said, “A picture is worth a thousand words,” which I would have to disagree with. In my mind, art forms such as painting are worth more than a photograph, and can have more meaning than,“a thousand words.” \\n\\nPhotography may be a more effective and reasonably inexpensive alternative to drawing or painting, but more thought and feeling goes into a painting than a photograph. Photography is relatively simple in comparison to painting, which is a much more complex task. With photography, the composition is already completely arranged, and with a painting the objective is much more open to interpretation by the artist. The artist has the ability to capture more emotion, understanding, and significance in an event and apply this fiery drive to his paintbrush when creating his own masterpiece.

== Mold: A Growing Concern ==\\n\\n\\nIndoor mold has been around for centuries, even the Old Testament of the Bible mentioned inspection and removal of mold. Why all the concern now? \\n\\nThere are many reasons. The first is the fact that the construction industry has changed dramatically in the past 40 years. Architects and builders are more focused on conserving energy and are constructing homes to be airtight. As a result, proper ventilation of these homes is almost non-existent. Before air conditioning came about, we ventilated our homes through open windows. Today, a majority of homes rely on air conditioning systems to do that same job. Unfortunately it doesn’t work that way. \\n\\nMost residential air conditioning systems are able to remove moisture but do not bring in any outside air. These systems circulate and cool the same indoor air over and over again resulting in improper ventilation for most homes. On an average, 90 percent of the general public’s time is spent indoors. Studies have shown that indoor air can be up to five times more polluted than outdoor air. The American Society of Home Inspectors says that “up to 38 percent of all homes have a mold and fungus growth due to elevated moisture levels.”  Studies have shown a rise in health problems resulting from mold exposure.\\n\\nMold grows almost anywhere there is water or elevated moisture. In the right conditions, it can start growing within 24 to 48 hours and is often difficult to notice. Mold can grow behind walls and ceilings, leaky appliances, in attics, and even in your a/c system. People believe that if it can’t be seen, it is not there, however most of the time this is untrue. If you see any mold growth in your home, there is likely to be more that is hidden. \\n\\nMold releases microscopic spores impossible to see with the naked eye. These airborne spores can trigger many physical reactions depending on the type of spore and quantity inhaled. Even a relatively small amount of mold spores could adversely affect infants, children, immune-compromised patients, pregnant women, individuals with existing respiratory conditions and the elderly. Of these thousands of existing molds, some are known as allergens while others produce harmful mycotoxins which could cause serious ailments.\\n\\nIn summary, all molds, in the right conditions and in abundance, are a threat. Inhalation of large quantities of airborne mold spores can cause many health problems.\\n\\nThe purpose of a mold inspection is to determine the presence of mold spores, identify the kind of mold, determine the amount of spores found are normal or elevated for that environment, and to find the source that caused this mold growth. \\n\\n[http://www.ecotechus.com]\\n[http://www.moldtestingflorida.com]\\n\\n--[[User:Emyerfo|Emyerfo]] 20:12, 10 May 2007 (UTC)
In the natural sciences an isolated system, as contrasted with a open system, is a physical system that does not interact with its surroundings. It obeys a number of conservation laws: its total energy and mass stay constant. They cannot enter or exit, but can only move around inside. An example is in the study of spacetime, where it is assumed that asymptotically flat spacetimes exist.\\n\\nTruly isolated physical systems do not exist in reality (except perhaps for the universe as a whole), because, for example, there is always gravity between a system with mass and masses elsewhere. However, real systems may behave nearly as an isolated system for finite (possibly very long) times. The concept of an isolated system can serve as a useful model approximating many real-world situations.
A Physical Therapist Assistant is an allied healthcare professional, licensed to perform certain physical therapy procedures to assist the recovery of acutely or chronically ill or injured people, health maintenance of the healthy, and treatment of life-threatening conditions in a wide range of health care settings.\\n\\nThey often assist physical therapists in providing physical therapy treatments and procedures. They may, in accordance with State laws, assist in the development of treatment plans, carry out routine functions, document the progress of treatment, and modify specific treatments in accordance with patient status and within the scope of treatment plans established by a physical therapist. Generally, PTAs enter practice by first earning an Associates Degree (AAS) at an accredited institution, then become licensed by the state board upon successful passing of a standardized licensure examination.\\n\\nPhysical therapist assistants duties include: a) designing exercise programs and treatments that are within the plan of care proposed by the physical therapist b) training patients to use special equipment that will make life easier; c) applying equipment such as electrical stimulation and ultrasound which decrease pain and increase functions; and d) keeping records and reporting to the physical therapist on the patient's progress.\\n\\nPhysical therapist assistants work with all ages and are employed in a wide variety of settings, including hospitals, rehabilitation centers, pediatric facilities or school systems, private physical therapy clinics, home health care agencies, and extended care facilities.\\n\\nEducation
Statements like "the author [of a sci-fi/futuristic movie] has failed to envisage that the processes of fashion may continue into the far future" suggest that the author of this comment may be unaware of the fact that many science fiction works portray realities in which human and societal evolution have rendered fashion irrelevant.\\n\\nAnother point:\\n"There is typically little consideration in these visions of futuristic clothing that one-piece skin-tight garments might be unflattering to those with less than ideal body shapes, presumably because the author either assumes that the human body will have reached a state of athletic perfection through genetic engineering in the future, or -- again -- because of a failure of imagination."\\n\\nWhile many science fiction works do in fact portray a future where improved nutrition and health care result in increased longevity, health and relative "athletic perfection," there is still a third option: (presumably) intellectually advanced societies might not be so offended by the "unflattering" appearance of "those with less than ideal body shapes".
Coming from a professional background of film and television, my interests gradually shifted to philosophy. Now I am interested in using the internet as a platform to develop a new global value-based thinking to serve as ground for a harmoniously dynamic world, interconnected on the basis of naturally emerging bonds, rather than artificially implemented ideologies and coercive policies. Such a model can only be based on one thing: the primacy of values and the valuing subject. \\n\\nStill interested in making film I aim to combine the two - film and philosophy - more and more in the future. But my present objective is to create on the internet an effective thinking platform for 21st century thought, in which the rational animal finally sheds its last superstitions: the dogmatic belief in a one and only truth, be it scientific objectivity, God, or any other type of absolutist ethics. I believe that the time has come for humanity to conquer the fear of being fully responsible for what it is.\\n\\nMy philosophy has been developed so far under the term "value ontology".
RE: Growth of Extinction\\n\\nMr. Lipuma,\\n\\nForests are large wooded areas which are primarily made up of trees that make up an ecosystem. There are several variations of forests and in general, these ecosystems are home to two-thirds of the planets species that inhabit land (Nature Conservancy).  Experts predict that species that exist in forests are becoming extinct at a rate 1000 times higher than natural factors.  As of 2010, 7.5 million acres of forest are lost to deforestation (Messanger, Stephen).  Forests not only provide habitats for the organisms living in them, but provide clean air and water for the rest of the world.\\n\\nThe existing definition of Forests on Wikipedia reads:\\n\\nA forest, also referred to as a wood or the woods, is an area with a high density of trees. As with cities, depending on various cultural definitions, what is considered a forest may vary significantly in size and have different classifications according to how and what of the forest is composed.[1][vague] These plant communities cover approximately 9.4 percent of the Earth's surface (or 30 percent of total land area), though they once covered much more (about 50 percent of total land area), in many different regions and function as habitats for organisms, hydrologic flow modulators, and soil conservers, constituting one of the most important aspects of the biosphere. Although forests are classified primarily by trees, the concept of a forest ecosystem includes additional species (such as smaller plants, fungi,[2] bacteria, and animals) as well as physical and chemical processes such as energy flow and nutrient cycling.\\n\\nA typical forest is composed of the overstory (canopy or upper tree layer) and the understory. The understory is further subdivided into the shrub layer, herb layer, and also the moss layer and soil microbes. In some complex forests, there is also a well-defined lower tree layer. Forests are central to all human life because they provide a diverse range of resources: they store carbon, aid in regulating the planetary climate, purify water and mitigate natural hazards such as floods. Forests also contain roughly 90 percent of the world's terrestrial biodiversity. \\n\\nThis existing definition gives you a general idea of what a forest is, but it lacks detail on their role in the environment. The definition in general lacks supporting information and references and the second paragraph does not transition to the first paragraph. The second paragraph should be an informative paragraph within the article, not the definition. To better re-write this definition, more statistics should be included to get an audience interested. I like the way that had included that today, “30% of total land area is covered by forest…” (Wikipedia) . This piece of information makes an audience continue to read because it is a fact not an assumption, but is not referenced.  After reading that, it makes me realize how much of the earth is covered by forest and wonder what happens if it disappears? I personally want to know the past and current status of forests. For example, if you try to look up Amelia Earhart  on Wikipedia, in the first paragraph the reader can immediately find that she was the first pilot to fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo and then she tried to fly across the Pacific Ocean and disappeared and her body was never recovered. After reading, I, the reader, want to know more information on how she got started in aviation, how she was able to fly across the Atlantic and not the Pacific, and the detail on her missing body. If the author(s) of the “Forest” article stated more facts immediately in the definition, the reader would continue to read. \\nIn efforts to improve the existing article, I have found additional sites and articles that appeal to the definition for improvement. Two thirds of the planets species that inhabit land live in forests.  This article is provided by the Nature Conservancy, an organization built to preserve forests. This site contains information on the conservation of forests, and how they reestablish, and protect them. It is obvious that the site is updated continuously because it contains features and new articles throughout. This organization also provides information on their purpose, where they can be contacted, and what the reader can do to help. This source keeps information relevant and up to date to keep the reader involved. \\nAn additional site, American Forests, is another conservation organization. They go into more detail of the importance of forests to air, water, climate, energy, wildlife, recreation, and people. For example, “The average healthy, mature tree produces roughly 260 pounds of oxygen annually. The average person consumes 386 pounds of oxygen per year. Two trees provide enough oxygen for one person per year” (American Forests) .  When you realize what two trees are capable of, you can only imagine what acres and acres can provide. Another source I found was an article that was displayed on an environmental interest website, or similar to a blog. The author of this site stated, “…3 million hectares (7.5 million acres) of forest loss per year…” (Messanger, Stephen) . A statistic like that does not imply the author’s opinion of the decrease in forests, but it gives the reader a sense of what is occurring today. This particular article was written in 2010, which could have been subjected to change over the past two years, but it also referrers to the number of forests being destroyed from 10 years prior and compares them.  \\n\\nI suggest that the information I have researched should be added the definition of Forest to Wikipedia. The statistics referred to in the above paragraphs had been referred from reputable organizations. They provide useful information on the importance of forest and their existing well being. Adding these facts to the definition will keep the reader interested because the author is stating the truth as opposed to making a observation or assumption. \\nIf acceptable, I would like to abide by Wikipedia rules, and help improve the existing definition to help readers better understand that forests are more than just a cluster of trees and what they contain before the article goes into the detail and the geography behind them.  I can be reached at my Wikipedia ID at laj-NJITWILL or by email at laj2@njit.edu.

== Ongoing Challenges ==\\nUtopia presents a fascinating instance of the set of problems, challenges and achievements that are entailed in the long search for a just integration of remote indigenous people into the Australian community. Its 30 year history is a record of 'self-determination' on a background of well developed communal will, strong participation, and an experience during the era of settlement which included some profitable relations with white pastoralists and some degree of continuous occupation. It's success, in mitigating the clinical disorders associated with transition to sedentary life, and minimising the advent of destructive behaviours and intoxicants; in maintaining a strong commitment to traditional practices and customs, and the ever present interest in the issue of identity in the face of coercive change, are impressive. Even so, the future of Utopia and places like it is problematic; the notion of integration itself the subject of contention; self determination is only effective inside a sphere of dependency that brings with it a plethora of social and political consequences. To many observers, the outstanding deficiency in remote communities is education, which provides its beneficiaries with capacities for choosing the terms of their own integration. It is of course, also a powerful integrative force itself, and so shifts the issue of cultural identity. The tensions due to these inevitable dilemmas are present at Utopia. The community is however in an unusually good position to resolve them, given time and a sympathetic administration.
\\n'''Miss Africa New Jersey'''beauty pageant was established in 2011 to focus on the intelligence, culture, talents, and beauty of African women in New Jersey. This contest was carefully thought out, planned, and designed to help uplift and reward outstanding young African women. We believe this event can be used to help promote the empowerment of women and girls in various countries throughout Africa. In addition, it is our hope that we will be able to provide a great foundation for African women who are making changes in Africa through education; and also for those educating young African women to become strong and efficient role models as well. Sadly today, more and more young African women are making the wrong choices. Dropping out of school, getting involved with drugs, alcohol, crimes and experiencing motherhood at early ages are all problems facing today’s youth. Because women are the backbone of every nation, we believe this event has great potential to make major changes. They is a wise saying that “When you educate a woman, you educate a nation.
Unknown to many people, bananas have historical societal significance. Bananas have been known to help reduce the symptoms and pains of PMS in females. They are ripe when they are spotted brown- not when they are green or nearly fully brown. Their consumption can assist concentration and focus by healing some stress and keeping eyesight healthy. Banana peels can heal warts when the inner part of the peel is placed on the skin. They are a rich source of fiber and many other essential nutrients and vitamins. Presently there are various examples in the public realm that highlight the importance of bananas. Here are just a few of those examples: the children's show "Bananas in Pajamas," the banana slug as the mascot for the University of California at Santa Cruz, an online networking portal named "Broadband Bananas," and the Washington Banana Museum.

This is an updated and edited version of Robin Marris' classicThe Economic Theory of Managerial Capitalism (1964). This was widely recognized as pathbreaking as it was the first attempt by a professional economist to make a formal theory of the behavior and growth of a large-scale "managerial" corporation based on a realistic assessment of the sociological and institutional environment. The model determined the long run growth rates of individual firms on the basis of the financial and market environment on the one hand, and the needs, interest and aspirations of both managers and shareholders on the other. Managers in particular were shown to trade desire for growth against fear of takeover. These then novel important features of modern capitalism--mergers, takeovers and executive bonuses and the relationship between the growth of firms and the growth of the economy--have become increasingly topical. The new book contains the original introduction along with reworked and updated coverage of the theoretical model, along with completely new chapters both of micro-theory and assessing and responding to the debate which the book created.
Eliahi Priest,\\n\\nSeeks simple advanced and clean energy solutions for obvious reasons we are all aware of.\\n\\n\\nAfter only 2 or 3 generations of cultural madness, we now ALL bear a responsibility to at least 4,000 generations into the future.\\n \\n \\nSince the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the world has fallen into a madness of nuclear proliferation. While the nuclear power industry will proclaim its validity as a clean energy producer, it is clear that its only real intent is the plutonium extracted from spent uranium fuels that service the military agenda of nuclear warfare. Nuclear power as an energy source is an absurdity that only underlines the madness and irresponsibility of those who assume leadership in service of an oligarchic global hedgemony.\\n\\nNuclear power is profoundly harmful to all life. Not only that, but it is absurdly inneficient in its processes. After the mining, processing, and shipping of uranium, and the plant construction, maintenance, and deconstruction, a nuclear plant only produces about as much energy as went into it — not counting the need to store the only thing it actually produces (radioactive waste) for hundreds of thousands of years — and not counting the sacrifice of areas of the earth. Uranium has a half life of 4.5 billion years and as exposed radioactive waste causes lung cancer, bone cancer, and kidney failure. Radioactive waste is deadly for more than 240,000 years (9,600 generations), while deep underground storage facilities such as Onkalo in Norway, shudder at a 100,000 (4,000 generations) year forecast.\\n\\nUranium mining poisons miners and families by contaminating surrounding lands, scarce water supplies and the air they breathe. Most Uranium is mined from lands that indiginous cultures recognise as sacred with awareness of the uranium that is present. Kazakhstan is the worlds largest uranium miner, followed by Canada and Australia. In Kazakhstan soil erosion and water shortage are serious issues. In Canada and Australia (and the US)  dispute with first nation peoples has been intense over both uranium mining and nuclear waste repository sites.\\n\\nAn average nuclear plant produces 20-30 tons of high-level waste and 70 tons of low-level waste per year.  There already exists a very approximate level of 300,000 tons of high level nuclear waste that must be dealt with (250,000 tons in 2010 according to the documentary 'Into Eternity'). The amount of high level nuclear waste continues to increase as long as nuclear power generation is contiued. No proven long-term storage site exists.  If one ever does, we won’t know what language to post the warning signs in, as no human language has lasted a fraction of the time the nuclear waste will remain deadly. Confronted by this truth proposed 'Adaptive Phase Management' of nuclear waste means burying it and forgetting about it. Out of site out of mind is not a responsible attitude for dealing with extremely toxic nuclear waste.\\n\\nThe madness of the nuclear age must end NOW, and anyone who assumes any position of authority must address responsibility for the harm already created and recognise the new energy potentials that can deliver unlimited, non-harmful, non-polluting free energy, establishing an age of prosperity and abundance for all. Such solution is wholly aligned with the will of Gt. Spirit.\\n\\nSimples.
3 Predictions for Older Adults in 2009 from the Nutrition Experts\\n\\nHow Fitness and Nutrition Professionals should be aware of these predictions and educate the older population about Resistance Training and Nutrition in Brain Health\\n\\nHere's what some of the Nutrition experts predicted and reported at the American Dietetic Association's Food and Nutrition Conference & Expo in Chicago late October 2008:\\n\\nConference presenters predicted that Baby Boomers will fall victim to debilitating condition called sarcopenia , a progressive loss of muscle mass. To respond  to this "silent epidemic," fitness professionals should educate older adults about the benefits of exercise , especially resistance training .\\nNurture your noggin was the call of some presenters who spoke about the vital role of nutrition in brain health. Presenters discussed the beneficial effects of different nutrients and food compounds , such as omega -3 fatty acids found in fish , and theanine , an amino acid  found in tea . The take-home message was that nutrition may improve memory and slow cognitive decline associated with aging.\\nA new term, ecogastronomy, refers to the trend among consumers to eat "green" and in a way that sustains both our planet and our bodies. Presenters underscored the need to educate people about how their food  choices affect the environment; examples of negative influences included our reliance on disposable plastic bottles and throwaway utensils, Americans' excessive beef consumption and the transport of goods over great distances\\n\\nThese are the facts and predictions of the very best and we should all make an effort to educate the public and the consumers of these influences and trends.

Reducing body fat has become a common challenge in our 21st century world.  Our days are filled with busy schedules and time restraints.  Hence we take quick and easy meals to satisfy our body metabolism.\\nThese meals may not be what our bodies need.  Our bodies are not able to work at the highest level of functioning; mentally, physically and spiritually.  We require answers to our questions; how we get beyond this challenge and how can we enable a recovery process if our bodies have been neglected in proper nutrition.  What complicates this challenge is the fact that every human being is different and requires different nutrients.\\n\\nThrough searching out and finding our body types we are able to assist in discovering the best nutrition and thus achieve the highest level of body functioning.
Beijing's Pollution Alarms Neighbors \\n\\nThe good news for the Chinese leadership is that their fiscal policies have paid off, producing both the world's second largest economy and the globe's leading creditor nation in less than a generation. \\n\\nThe less good news is that the country's hell-bent drive towards industrialization has brought in its train a host of collateral problems, not the least of which is pollution. Last month Beijing's air pollution soared past levels considered hazardous by the World Health Organization. \\n\\nPrior to that, the government often played down the pollution in Beijing, insisting it was merely fog, despite evidence to the contrary that was plain for all to see. Earlier this year, following public pressure resulting from hourly air-quality readings first published in 2011 by the U.S. embassy in Beijing, which Chinese authorities had previously denounced as "foreign interference," the municipal officials took notice. On 12 January the air-quality monitor operated by the U.S. embassy in Beijing recorded a Particulate Matter PM 2.5 level of 886 micrograms a cubic meter, nearly 35 times what the World Health Organization considers safe. \\n\\nHow bad? \\n\\nOn 5 February flights were grounded as visibility fell to around 200 meters across Beijing. Last month Beijing's Jiangong Hospital recorded a 30 percent spike in cases involving respiratory problems and the hospital's Emergency Department chief Cui Qifeng noted, "People tend to catch colds or suffer from lung infections during the days with heavily polluted air." \\n\\nAccording to a Chinese Academy of Engineering specialist in respiratory diseases, speaking about Beijing's current pollution levels, "It (the pollution) is more frightening than SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). For SARS, you can consider quarantine and other means. But no one can escape from the air pollution and indoor pollution." The six-month SARS epidemic in 2003 killed 775 people in 25 countries. \\n\\nCauses? \\n\\nBeijing alone now has five million cars choking the streets, spewing their exhaust into the air. More importantly, the nation's pollution problems are caused by China developing at a speed and scale unprecedented in history, which has produced widespread environmental degradation that the central authorities have been slow to acknowledge. Aside from vehicle exhaust, thermal energy plants utilizing the nation's poor grade coal power the country's factories, providing the heat for hundreds of millions of homes even as they belch toxins into the atmosphere. \\n\\nAnd the toxic air threatens to become an international issue as well. Drifting across the Sea of Japan, the smog is now impacting parts of Japan, with the Japanese Ministry of the Environment's website on 5 February being overloaded. One ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity said, "Access to our air-pollution monitoring system has been almost impossible since last week, and the telephone here has been constantly ringing because worried people keep asking us about the impact on health." \\n\\nWhile the Japanese government remained discreet about air quality issues, Ministry of the Environment official Yasushi Nakajima was more blunt, stating, "We can't deny there is an impact from pollution in China." According to National Institute for Environmental Studies researcher Atsushi Shimizu, the prevailing winds from the west carry air pollution over western Japan. The pollution from China has exceeded government limits for particulate matter, which government concern focusing on particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter, whose concentration has been reported as high as 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air in northern Kyushu. The Japanese government limit is 35 micrograms. \\n\\nSolutions? \\n\\nResponding to the recent crisis, Beijing's city government ordered 103 heavily polluting factories to suspend production and told government departments and state-owned enterprises to reduce their use of cars by a third. \\n\\nMore immediately, on 6 Feb. the Chinese government issued a timetable for its program to upgrade fuel quality, aiming to implement a strict standard nationwide by 2017, upgrading its standard V for automobile petrol, with sulfur content within 10 parts per million before the end of the year. \\n\\nBut the country's long term solutions will not be inexpensive  reducing the use of coal, forcing cars to use efficient pollution exhaust equipment, and developing mass transit options to reduce the country's rising love affair with the automobile. \\n\\nChina now has the wealth to implement such solutions whether the political will is there is quite another matter. Should authorities not act, then they'd better ramp up the country's health insurance policies, as undoubtedly more and more workers will be reporting sick days. \\n\\nSource: http://www.indepthexploration.com\\n\\nSource: http://oilprice.com/The-Environment/Global-Warming/Chinas-Smog-Becoming-an-International-Issue.html \\n\\nBy.

In 2006, [http://savethechildren.net/alliance/index.html Save the Children]  launched its Rewrite the Future program to ensure that the millions of children unable to attend school because of war or conflict get access to quality education. '''Over 77 million''' children are growing up today without an education. '''32 million''' children are out of school in areas affected by war and conflict. '''Millions more''' living in conflict-affected countries are receiving a substandard education.\\n\\nYet education can bring protection and stability, and the potential to start building a more peaceful and prosperous society. \\n\\nIn areas of war and conflict, education is often among the first casualties. Schools close, teachers flee or are recruited into the military, and school systems are no longer funded. This puts children at risk, making them easier targets for recruitment as child soldiers, or exploitation as cheap labor. It also increases their vulnerability to trafficking and abuse.  \\n\\nSave the Children pledges to:\\n\\n* Ensure quality education for 8 million children: access to education for 3 million children and improved quality of education for these children and 5 million more. \\n* Work to make schools safe environments for protecting children affected by conflict. \\n* Influence national governments and international agencies to prioritize education at the onset of an emergency. \\n* Increase public and private funding for quality education for conflict- affected countries.\\n\\n==See also==\\n\\n* [[Save the Children]]

From cradle to grave man is dependent on resources from the environment for shelter and sustenance. For sustenance, nutrition and nourishment these resources can be obtained from two sources, harvesting living organisms for food, either through a hunter-gathering nomadic existence or a settled pastoral crop-growing usually coupled with animal husbandry life-style. For shelter and hand implements, man turns to the minerals, metals, soils and gravels that are encountered on earth. Mining is the study of obtaining inorganic minerals, metals, and carbonic fuels from the solid portion of the surface crust of the earth in an organised manner and on an industrial scale to satisfy the need of man to survive on the hostile environment of the planet.

Drunk driving is the act of operating and/or driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs to the degree that mental and motor skills are impaired. It is illegal in all jurisdictions within the U.S. The specific criminal offense is usually called driving under the influence [of alcohol and/or other drugs] (DUI), and in some states driving while intoxicated (DWI), operating while impaired (OWI), or operating a vehicle under the influence (OVI). Such laws may also apply to boating or piloting aircraft.\\n\\nIn the United States the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that 17,941 people died in 2006 in "alcohol-related" collisions, representing 41 percent of total traffic deaths in the US. Over 500,000 people were injured in alcohol-related accidents in the US in 2003. NHTSA defines fatal collisions as "alcohol-related" if they believe the driver, a passenger, or a nonoccupant of the vehicle (such as a pedestrian or pedalcyclist) had a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.01 or greater. NHTSA defines nonfatal collisions as "alcohol-related" if the accident report indicates evidence of alcohol present. NHTSA specifically notes that "alcohol-related" does not necessarily mean a driver or nonoccupant was tested for alcohol and that the term does not indicate a collision or fatality was caused by the presence of alcohol.[1] On average, about 60 percent of the BAC values are missing or unknown. To analyze what they believe is the complete data, statisticians simulate BAC information.\\n[http://www.legalx.net California DUI]
'''Taiko Fujimura''' is a mixed media artist based in San Francisco. Working with wood, paints, plexiglas, mirrors and found objects, she creates conceptual two- and three-dimensional collage and assemblage works as well as paintings on wood, canvas, rice paper, and several types of archival papers. Her three-dimensional work is designed to invite the viewer to interact with each piece to discover his or her personal aesthetic within the microcosm of what Taiko presents as the broader representation of beauty.\\n\\nTaiko selects materials that link her inner self with the outside world, creating an extended montage of her personal experiences, connections and relationships with both people and objects. Her pieces confront the dichotomies between chaos and order, industrial and organic, mind and body, positive and negative, logical and random, and intuitive and sequential. She feels an understanding of dualism is key to her art. Her pieces seek to bridge the contradictions around us by unifying space.\\n\\nThe concepts she explores include quietude, peacefulness, harmony, unity, and universality. Her work is strongly influenced by Japanese wabi-sabi, an aesthetic system she strongly believes to be "beautiful" art and Japanese calligraphy, which she studied since age six. Her works appear in over 100 private and public collections globally.
ECuebas Sandbox\\n\\nFundraising and advocacyJDRF's largest fundraising event in the U.S. is the Walk to Cure Diabetes. Events are held across the country to raise awareness about type 1 diabetes and raise funds to be put toward research.[7]\\n\\nJDRF's Children Congress is its premier advocacy event and is held every two years in Washington, D.C. Children ranging from age 4 to 17 are selected from each state to become their state's delegate in Washington. Delegates then head to Washington to meet with their representatives to tell their stories and advocate for increased federal funding and support for type 1 diabetes research.[8]\\n\\n[edit] ResearchJDRF funds research that is aimed at improving the lives of people with type 1 diabetes today and in the future. JDRF focuses on research that seeks to: stop or slow the disease’s progression in people who are newly diagnosed; reverse the disease and its complications in those who have lived with it for years; prevent type 1 in people at risk and in future generations; and improve treatments for type 1 diabetes and provide better tools to achieve tight blood glucose control for people at all stages of the disease.\\n\\nJDRF research can be categorized in three main areas:[9]\\n\\nCure, which includes:\\nReplacement and Regeneration Research (replacing or regenerating the beta cells that produce insulin)\\nImmune Research (reversing and preventing the immune system attack that causes type 1 diabetes)\\n\\nTreat, which includes:\\n\\nArtificial Pancreas Project Research (closing the loop between continuous glucose sensing technologies and insulin pump technologies)\\n\\n\\nGlucose Control Therapy Research (improving people’s lives by enabling them to maintain better control of their blood sugar by development of either new devices or therapies)\\n\\n\\nComplications Prevention Research (stopping or reversing the progression of complications in people with diabetes, such as eye or kidney disease—and treating these conditions in the people who already have them)\\n\\n\\nDiabetic Eye Disease Research\\n\\n\\nPrevent, which includes:\\n\\nPrevention Research into the environmental and genetic causes of the disease.

\\n\\nA supernova is the explosion of a star when it has ultimately reached the end stages of its life. After a supernova explosion, the star's gaseous remains are fired into space at insanely high speeds. But these gases do not just simply fade away into nothingness. Instead, these gases form the most fascinating and unique object ever found, a nebula.\\n\\n'What is a nebula?', you may ask. Well, a nebula is a cloud of dust and gas in outer space. I find nebulas very beautiful, they hold whole star systems with planets, maybe even capable of wielding life on their surface.
What is spatial opacity?\\n\\nSpatial opacity is a geographical term who leads with any type of obstacles who are found in space. Spatial opacity is everywhere an can have multiple characteristics, whether it is natural (hills, mountains, lakes, seas and so on) or not natural (traffic lights, intersections, doors and so on). Spatial opacity is everything that stops or interrupts any type of flows who are related to space.\\n\\n\\nMASDA \\n\\nCourses:\\n\\nThe main input from the courses is a very theoretical overview of the material. Depending on the subject, you may get some applied examples on how the theory matches real examples. \\nThe courses include a lot of training in statistics as well as approaches to spatial planning with computer support (GIS). All courses are presented with Powerpoint support and in the English language. \\nMany courses treat various policy issues on spatial planning of the European Union as well as political issues within the different EU Member States. In addition to that, there are some courses about sustainability in terms of spatial planning. \\nMost of the courses are related to the European Union and do not necessarily treat spatial planning of non-EU member States.
'''Virtual Surgery'''\\n\\nVirtual reality is a computer generated technology which allows information to be displayed in a simulated environment. Over the past decade virtual reality and computer simulation have expanded into other domains including the medical field.\\nVirtual reality is perhaps being used more in Medicine than in any other industry, because its applications have such far-reaching benefits. It promises to bring one of the most dramatic changes to the practice of medicine over the next decade.\\nIn Surgical training there is often a short fall in the number of desired operations performed. One consequence is that trainees may have less practice and feel less confident about many surgical procedures and techniques. With the increasing level of difficulty of surgical procedures it has become imperative that trainees have an arena in which to learn their trade that is forgiving. With the advent of Virtual reality, this has become a reality. \\nAt the present there are many applications of virtual reality in Medicine\\n•	Education - VR is used to create an environment for learning anatomy where exercises can be easily reversed.\\n•	Simulation for Surgical training -VR can teach surgeons new procedures and determine their level of competence before they operate on patients. It allows the trainee to practise a skill several times as a refresher course. \\n•	Project Hippocrates: VR is used to simulate, plan and execute Orthopaedic surgeries. The goal of this system is to allow the surgeons to simulate operations and then alter their approach to them based on the results of the simulated surgical procedure. The program allows the surgeon to plan his or her surgery.\\n•	Telemedicine: Telemedicine is a system of electronically communicating data from one site to a distant site for the purpose of medical diagnosis, patient care and as a medium for delivering medical services over long distances.
Individual differences psychology focuses on this second level of study. It is also sometimes called Differential Psychology because researchers in this area study the ways in which individual people differ in their behavior. This is distinguished from other aspects of psychology in that although psychology is ostensibly a study of individuals, modern psychologists often study groups or biological underpinnings of cognition.\\n\\nFor example, in evaluating the effectiveness of a new therapy, the mean performance of the therapy in one group might be compared to the mean effectiveness of a placebo (or a well-known therapy) in a second, control group. In this context, differences between individuals in their reaction to the experimental and control manipulations are actually treated as errors rather than as interesting phenomena to study.\\n\\nThis is because psychological research depends upon statistical controls that are only defined upon groups of people. Individual difference psychologists usually express their interest in individuals while studying groups by seeking dimensions shared by all individuals but upon which individuals differ.
Beware of food-borne diseases this summer\\nBy EDUARDO GONZALES, MD\\nMarch 30, 2009, 12:16pm\\nQ. Is it true that food-borne diseases are more common during summer? If so, why? Can you enumerate these diseases? How can we prevent them? -- Myrna M., Los Banos, Laguna \\n\\nA. Yes, the incidence of food-borne diseases peaks during summer. This is primarily because most food-borne pathogens (i.e., disease-causing microorganisms) grow fastest in warm and humid weather. Furthermore, people do more cooking and eating outdoors (i.e., picnics, barbecues, campings) during summer, which means they do without the safety facilities that their houses provide such as refrigeration and proper washing. \\n\\nThe list of diseases caused by pathogens or their toxins (poisons) that are transmitted through the intake of contaminated food and water is a long one. Most of these diseases affect the gastro-intestinal tract, but some affect other organs, too.  Food-borne pathogens include viruses such as the hepatitis A virus; bacteria such as those that cause food poisoning and various forms of gastroenteritis, cholera, typhoid fever and botulism; protozoa such as E. histolytica, the causative agent of amebiasis; and, other parasites such as ascaris, other roundworms and tapeworms.\\n\\nAny food item can be contaminated by pathogens and toxins. The contamination can occur during production, processing, distribution, preparation or storage of food. \\n\\nContamination of food with disease-causing agents can occur in the farm. For example, tapeworms which humans acquire when they eat raw or half-cooked meat find their way into pork or beef when cattle and pigs ingest the eggs of these worms while grazing. Another example, amoeba and the hepatitis A virus contaminate vegetables if plants are fertilized with night soil or watered with water from sewage canals (two common practices in the Philippines). \\n\\nFood processing plants that do not comply with standard health safety procedures are also occasional sources of pathogens in food products. But very often, food-borne illnesses are caused by improper handling and preparation of food at home.  \\n\\nFood-borne diseases, without exception, are preventable. Most can be prevented by simply observing the following measures:\\n\\n* Buy and consume only food (either raw or processed) that complies with safety standards.\\n* Cook food thoroughly. In particular, meat should not be eaten raw.\\n* Thoroughly wash with flowing water fruits and vegetables that are to be eaten raw.  This will not totally eliminate pathogens, but their number can be significantly reduced for the body’s other defenses to take care of.\\n* Wash food items for cooking before chopping or cutting.\\n* Wash with soap and water all utensils, chopping boards and kitchen areas before preparing meals.\\n* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing, eating and handling food.\\n* Eat cooked food within 1-2 hours after cooking. \\n* Refrigerate leftovers within 1-2 hours. \\n* Re-heat leftovers thoroughly before eating.\\n* Do not allow contact or mixing of raw and cooked foods.  \\n* Protect food from rodents, cockroaches, flies and other insects.\\n* Consume milk only if it has been pasteurized.\\n* Ensure that your drinking water is safe.\\n* When going for outings, keep perishable food like cooked meats, potato salads, etc. in an insulated cooler that is packed with ice. Do the same for raw meat, poultry and vegetables, but in a separate cooler.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that may develop two to three weeks after a Group A streptococcal infection (such as strep throat or scarlet fever). It is believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity and can involve the heart, joints, skin, and brain[1]. Acute rheumatic fever commonly appears in children between ages 5 and 15, with only 20% of first time attacks occurring in adults[1].\\n\\nIt gets its name for its similarity in presentation to rheumatism.[2]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Diagnosis\\n \\nRheumatic heart disease at autopsy with characteristic findings (thickened mitral valve, thickened chordae tendineae, hypertrophied left ventricular myocardium).Modified Jones criteria were first published in 1944 by T. Duckett Jones, MD.[3] They have been periodically revised by the American Heart Association in collaboration with other groups.[4] According to revised Jones criteria, the diagnosis of rheumatic fever can be made when two of the major criteria, or one major criterion plus two minor criteria, are present along with evidence of streptococcal infection. Exceptions are chorea and indolent carditis, each of which by itself can indicate rheumatic fever. [5][6][7]\\n\\n[edit] Major criteria\\nMigratory polyarthritis: a temporary migrating inflammation of the large joints, usually starting in the legs and migrating upwards. \\nCarditis: inflammation of the heart muscle which can manifest as congestive heart failure with shortness of breath, pericarditis with a rub, or a new heart murmur. \\nSubcutaneous nodules: painless, firm collections of collagen fibers over bones or tendons. They commonly appear on the back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees. \\nErythema marginatum: a long lasting rash that begins on the trunk or arms as macules and spreads outward to form a snake like ring while clearing in the middle. This rash never starts on the face and it is made worse with heat. \\nSydenham's chorea (St. Vitus' dance): a characteristic series of rapid movements without purpose of the face and arms. This can occur very late in the disease. \\n[edit] Minor criteria\\nFever \\nArthralgia: Joint pain without swelling \\nRaised Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C reactive protein \\nLeukocytosis \\nECG showing features of heart block, such as a prolonged PR interval[8] \\nSupporting evidence of Streptococcal infection: elevated or rising Antistreptolysin O titre or DNAase.[1]. \\nPrevious episode of rheumatic fever or inactive heart disease \\n[edit] Other signs and symptoms\\nAbdominal pain \\nNose bleeds \\n[edit] Pathophysiology\\nRheumatic fever is a systemic disease affecting the peri-arteriolar connective tissue and can occur after an untreated Group A Beta hemolytic streptococcal pharyngeal infection. It is believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity. This cross-reactivity is a Type II hypersensitivity reaction and is termed molecular mimicry. Usually, self reactive B cells remain anergic in the periphery without T cell co-stimulation. During a Strep. infection, mature antigen presenting cells such as B cells present the bacterial antigen to CD4-T cells which differentiate into helper T2 cells. Helper T2 cells subsequently activate the B cells to become plasma cells and induce the production of antibodies against the cell wall of Streptococcus. However the antibodies may also react against the myocardium and joints[9], producing the symptoms of rheumatic fever.\\n\\nGroup A streptococcus pyogenes has a cell wall composed of branched polymers which sometimes contain "M proteins" that are highly antigenic. The antibodies which the immune system generates against the "M proteins" may cross react with cardiac myofiber protein myosin[10],heart muscle glycogen and smooth muscle cells of arteries, inducing cytokine release and tissue destruction. However, the only proven cross reaction is with perivascular connective tissue.[citation needed] This inflammation occurs through direct attachment of complement and Fc receptor-mediated recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. Characteristic Aschoff bodies, composed of swollen eosinophilic collagen surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages can be seen on light microscopy. The larger macrophages may become Aschoff giant cells. Acute rheumatic valvular lesions may also involve a cell-mediated immunity reaction as these lesions predominantly contain T-helper cells and macrophages.[11]\\n\\nIn acute RF, these lesions can be found in any layer of the heart and is hence called pancarditis. The inflammation may cause a serofibrinous pericardial exudates described as “bread-and-butter” pericarditis, which usually resolves without sequelae. Involvement of the endocardium typically results in fibrinoid necrosis and verrucae formation along the lines of closure of the left-sided heart valves. Warty projections arise from the deposition, while subendothelial lesions may induce irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques.\\n\\nChronic rheumatic heart disease is characterized by repeated inflammation with fibrinous resolution. The cardinal anatomic changes of the valve include leaflet thickening, commissural fusion and shortening and thickening of the tendinous cords. [11]\\n\\n[edit] Treatment\\nThe management of acute rheumatic fever is geared toward the reduction of inflammation with anti-inflammatory medications such as aspirin or corticosteroids. Individuals with positive cultures for strep throat should also be treated with antibiotics. Aspirin is the drug of choice and should be given at high doses of 100 mg/kg/day. One should watch for side effects like gastritis, salicylate poisoning etc. Steroids are reserved for cases where there is evidence of involvement of heart. The use of steroids may prevent further scarring of tissue and may prevent development of sequelae such as Mitral stenosis. Monthly injections of Longacting Penicillin must be given for a period of 5 years in patients having one attack of Rheumatic fever. If there is evidence of carditis, the length of Penidure therapy may be up to 40 years. Another important cornerstone in treating rheumatic fever includes the continual use of low dose antibiotics (such as penicillin, sulfadiazine, or erythromycin) to prevent recurrence.\\n\\n[edit] Infection\\nPatients with positive cultures for Streptococcus pyogenes should be treated with penicillin as long as allergy is not present. This treatment will not alter the course of the acute disease.\\n\\n[edit] Inflammation\\nPatients with significant symptoms may require corticosteroids. Salicylates are useful for pain.\\n\\n[edit] Heart failure\\nSome patients develop significant carditis which manifests as congestive heart failure. This requires the usual treatment for heart failure: diuretics and digoxin. Unlike normal heart failure, rheumatic heart failure responds well to corticosteroids.\\n\\n[edit] Prevention\\nPrevention of recurrence is achieved by eradicating the acute infection and prophylaxis with antibiotics. The American Heart Association recommends daily or monthly prophylaxis continue long-term, perhaps for life.[12]\\n\\nScreening school-aged children for sore throats also aid in prevention.\\n\\n[edit] Epidemiology\\n \\nDisability-adjusted life year for rheumatic heart disease per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.[13] \\n     no data\\n \\n     less than 20\\n \\n     20-40\\n \\n     40-60\\n \\n     60-80\\n \\n     80-100\\n \\n     100-120\\n \\n     120-140\\n \\n     140-160\\n \\n     160-180\\n \\n     180-200\\n \\n     200-330\\n \\n     more than 330Rheumatic fever is common worldwide and responsible for many cases of damaged heart valves. In Western countries, it became fairly rare since the 1960s, probably due to widespread use of antibiotics to treat streptococcus infections. While it is far less common in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century, there have been a few outbreaks since the 1980s. Although the disease seldom occurs, it is serious and has a mortality of 2–5%.[14]\\n\\nRheumatic fever primarily affects children between ages 5 and 15 years and occurs approximately 20 days after strep throat or scarlet fever. In up to a third of cases, the underlying strep infection may not have caused any symptoms.\\n\\nThe rate of development of rheumatic fever in individuals with untreated strep infection is estimated to be 3%. The incidence of recurrence with a subsequent untreated infection is substantially greater (about 50%).[15] The rate of development is far lower in individuals who have received antibiotic treatment. Persons who have suffered a case of rheumatic fever have a tendency to develop flare-ups with repeated strep infections.\\n\\nThe recurrence of rheumatic fever is relatively common in the absence of maintenance of low dose antibiotics, especially during the first three to five years after the first episode. Heart complications may be long-term and severe, particularly if valves are involved.\\n\\nSurvivors of Rheumatic fever often have to take penicillin to prevent streptococcal infection which could possibly lead to another case of Rheumatic fever that could prove fatal.
'''The Problem of Global Warming'''\\n\\nWe face many environmental challenges that pose a risk to the well-being of life on earth. Many scientists would agree that at the forefront of these issues stands global warming. Global warming poses a multitude of problems that threaten us. Not only are the issues of global warming risks to our health, they are also potential dangers to the entire planet and every living creature that dwells on it. If we truly want to resolve global warming, we must establish a comprehensive strategy that addresses a way of preserving the world for the future.\\n\\n'''The effects of Global Warming and how Mankind Contributes to Our Problem'''\\n\\nBecause of our careless and reckless disregard for the Earth, some nasty effects of global warming are all too common. These include things like: diseases spreading, the potentially destructive melting of the polar ice caps which could result in the disastrous flooding of the Earth, and the diminishing of the protective layers of the atmosphere. It may also be connected with causing allergies to become more severe. According to an article in the August 17, 2000 edition of the New York Times, pollen levels may rise as carbon dioxide levels are increasing. This happens because the more carbon dioxide there is in the air, plant growth is accelerated. \\n\\n'''What We Can Do to Make a Positive Change'''\\n\\nAs an environmentalist who enjoys experiencing nature and capturing its beauty in photography, I am alarmed by the fact that the United States is contributing the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The appropriate plan to act on global warming is to treat Mother Earth with more consideration by driving less, controlling the population from reaching a level the world does not have the resources or space to sustain, and recycling and planting trees. If we were to collectively do this, we would do much to help with global warming. \\n\\n'''An Explanation of How These Environmentalist Ideas Would Help'''\\n\\nActing on these ideas I have presented would help in different but significant ways. If we were to walk to the store, instead of driving, we would be releasing less carbon fumes into the air, which would result in preserving the diminishing layers of the atmosphere. If we were to control the population from becoming even more crowded than it already is, we would not need to burn down our forests and destroy nature to make room for the incoming population. Recycling and planting trees promotes a healthy environment by allowing us to save valuable and fleeting resources, and by planting trees, we are letting plants release more oxygen into the atmosphere which makes a difference with global warming by balancing the levels of oxygen and carbon.\\n\\n'''Final Note'''\\n\\nIt is time to finally treat Mother Earth with the respect she deserves and truly needs for us to continue living on this planet. We’ve also victimized plants and animals by ruthlessly destroying their habitat, and by threatening species of animals and plants into extinction. Animals and plants have just as much right as humans to live hospitably in an environment where they can thrive, without humans ruining their terrain. My hope is to motivate even a few readers of the **** ****** to preserve the earth, and to speak out against people polluting Mother Earth. The sooner we realize this, the better off humanity will be.
The Mold problem and the human bio-toxin pathway\\n\\n\\nMolds are everywhere! \\nThey are the largest biomass on the planet and are constantly at work breaking down biodegradeables every minute of everyday. They are in the air we breath, indoors and outdoors, and are usually not causing problems with humans. \\n\\nThat is, until they invade our homes or place of business! \\nRemember,moisture follows gravity and molds follow moisture...EVERY TIME! When a moisture problem occurrs, such as a roofing leak, flood, or even when the air system is shut-off in a humid environment, molds will begin to grow and colonize almost anywhere on almost any organic material. They can even grow on plastic and metal and other materials normally concidered safe from fungal invasion when dirt or other organic build-up exists.\\n\\nWhen molds invade our indoor environments, the amount of airborne mold spores is amplified to a much more dangerous level than we are normally exposed to, which can cause severe health effects and reactions in humans. \\nThe majority of these health effects are caused by the toxins that molds create to protect their spores or "babies". These toxins are chemical compounds that are attached to the spores to protect them from their natural predators, like germs, insects and bacteria. \\n\\nWhen most of us breathe in airborne mold spores, our bodies can recognize the intruders and can normally produce anti-bodies to destroy them and remove them from the body. \\nBut nearly 25% of humans have been found to have an irregular HLA-DR gene, and this is the gene that controls the immune response system in the body. Normally one or two people will suffer far more health problems than the rest of the inhabitants, who normally feel that the others are "over-reacting or paranoid". Far from paranoid, these people recognize the effects the molds are having on their bodies, and the effects are often more serious than most people realize. \\n\\nBio-toxins can cause a mirriad of health effects in humans, ranging from headaches and allergy symptoms to asthma, resperatory infections and other serious long-term health issues. Some people will eventually develope "multiple-chemical-sensitivity", a term that many physicians are still unfamiliar with and have no knowledge of treatments.

They lack close friends due to the isolation they have adapted to. Some examples of what socially isolating yourself can mean are staying home, having no communication with anyone including friend and family, and basically avoiding any contact with other beings. If there is any social contact with another social species then it is most likely concise. Emotional or psychological challenges are the results of social isolation.  These results can cause symptoms of feeling depressed, distress, or anxious. This causes feelings of loneliness, fear of others, or negative self-esteem. \\n\\n\\nSocial isolation is common among early adulthood. Some cases of this isolation can get extreme. Clear boundaries are more characterized when the ego part of the personality is fully developing. This personality component that Sigmund Freud proposed is defined as a idea of a person's self physically and mentally. Independence gives a sense of disconnection from others. During this time of development, a person may become more preoccupied with feelings and thoughts of their individuality that are not easy to share with other individuals. This can be a result from feelings of shame, guilt, or alienation during childhood experiences.

With the gradual worsening of climate change, Asthma is a serious chronic illness that is currently on the rise.  Approximately 20 million Americans are inflicted with asthma.  According to the Environmental Defense Fund, more than “4,000 die every year from the disease, which also causes some 1.8 million emergency room visits” (EmergencyDefenseFundOnline).  Why, in recent years, has asthma symptoms become more prevalent?  Who is most vulnerable to its effects?  How does global climate change come into play?  \\n	Beginning with defining asthma and what it does to the body, the reader can better understand asthma as a chronic illness that “constricts airways and makes them swollen, filling with mucus. Your chest feels tight -- you may cough or wheeze -- and you just can't seem to catch your breath. In severe cases, asthma attacks can be deadly” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Furthermore, the Natural Resources Defense Council found that asthma kills approximately “5,000 people every year in America” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  It has been proven that people residing in poorer areas, with little sanitation, and both young children, and the elderly, are vulnerable subgroups to climate change and its effects on asthma.  \\n	Beginning with the world’s poorest populations, the Practical Action organization found that the world’s poorest people are the hardest hit by climate change due to devastating droughts, floods, and other weather events (PracticalActionOnline).  Furthermore, Practical Action proclaims that there is a massive injustice present since “climate change is caused by the world’s richest countries” (PracticalActionOnline).  Since poor countries lack the financial means and strong voice to rise up against rich countries’ plans, which may have a debilitating effect on the earth’s environment, and further leads to climate change and the influx of asthmatic symptoms, these poor nations bear the burden of climate change.  \\n	According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the persistence of certain diseases, such as asthma, depend largely on climate change (EPAOnline).  The extreme temperature changes that we have experienced cause a great loss of life, particularly on the elderly.  Additionally, the extreme high temperature changes can “increase air and water pollution, which in turn harm human health” (EPAOnline).  Furthermore, the EPA explains that “climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can indirectly impact the incidence of serious infectious diseases” (EPAOnline).  \\nIt is important to note that the “extent and nature of climate change impacts on human health vary by region, by relative vulnerability of population groups, by the extent and duration of exposure to climate change itself and by society’s ability to adapt to or cope with the change” (EPAOnline).  By being exposed to these extreme climate changes, people are more inclined to contract diseases, such as asthma.  Climate change is expected to contribute to some air quality problems.  \\n	 Respiratory disorders, such as asthma, are more prevalent as the climate changes in extreme manners.  The four main air pollutants that trigger asthma are as follows: Ground Level Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide, Particulate Matter, and Nitrogen Oxide.  Beginning with Ground Level Ozone, it is a “toxic component of smog…that is produced at ground level when tailpipe pollution from cars and trucks reacts with oxygen and sunlight” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Ground level ozone is most common in city-like environments.  People living in cities, which are known to be less sanitary than suburban areas, are predominantly poor and thus lack the means to move to areas with better air quality.  The cities are filled with buses and cars emitting harmful gases into the air and thus harming people in the near surroundings. \\n	Sulfur Dioxide is a “respiratory irritant…that is produced when coal and crude oil are burned” ( NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  As mentioned previously, cities are filled with objects emitting harmful gases into the air, and sulfur dioxide is quite prevalent in city-like living areas.  Sulfur Dioxide is emitted from coal-fired power plants.  Unfortunately, “one in five Americans lives within 10 miles of a coal-fired power plant” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  The fact that so many Americans live in such a close proximity of the coal-fired power plants goes to show that poor people do not have a great advantage at living in sufficient living conditions.\\n	Particulate matters are tiny particles in the air.  They come from a wide range of pollutants, such as dust, soot, and diesel exhaust particles (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  If these small particles are suspended from the air and into the lungs, then an asthma symptom can be triggered; thus affecting the asthmatic.  Approximately, “81 million people live in areas that fail to meet national air quality standards for particulate matter” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Coal-fired power plants and diesel vehicles are major emitters of particulate matter and thus further prove that people residing in poor living conditions are affected more than people living in more affluent areas.\\n	Finally, Nitrogen Oxide is a “gas emitted from tailpipes and power plants…it contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone and smog” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Furthermore, Nitrogen Oxide, when mixed with other air pollutants, form small particles that can trigger asthma.

These impacts arise not only from raw materials and component purchases, supplier manufacturing processes or logistics aarangements, but can also include final product disposal and even the siting of supplier plants. Given the strategic importance and the scale of organisational buying, a range of possibilities for environmental initiatives exist in the supply chain. These begin with the product, component or raw material to be purchased, where the buying company could stipulate minimum standards that the purchased product has to fulfil.\\nFor example, a paper-maker can insist the woodpulb in buys conforms to recognised standards of forest management rather than being made from clear-cutting an entire forest, or an electronic company can require its supplier to avoid certain harmful heavy metals in the supplied products. Other product based environmental initiatives can aim at by products of supplied input such as recycling packaging or reducing waste.
Why Donate Blood ?\\n\\nBlood is the living fluid that all life is based on.\\nBlood is composed of 60% liquid part and 40% solid part. The liquid part called Plasma, made up of 90% water and 10% nutrients, hormones, etc. is easily replenished by food, medicines, etc.\\nBut the solid part that contains RBC (red blood cells), WBC (white blood cells) and Platelets take valuable time to be replaced if lost.\\nThis is where you come in. The time taken by a patient's body to replace it could cost his/her life. Sometimes the body might not be in a condition to replace it at all.\\nAs you know blood cannot be harvested it can only be donated. This means only you can save a life that needs blood.\\nEvery year India requires 40 million units of 250cc blood out of which only a meager 500,000 of blood units are available. Saving a life does not require heroic deeds.\\nYou could just do it with a small thought and an even smaller effort by saying "yes".
 History is the study of the past, with special attention to the written record of the activities of human beings over time. Scholars who write about history are called historians. It is a field of research which uses a narrative to examine and analyse the sequence of events, and it often attempts to investigate objectively the patterns of cause and effect that determine events.[1][2] Historians debate the nature of history and the lessons history teaches.[1][3][4] A famous quote by George Santayana has it that "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."[5] The stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the legends surrounding King Arthur) are usually classified as cultural heritage rather than the "disinterested investigation" needed by the discipline of histna

== Environment ==\\n\\n''ENVIRONMENT''\\nThe Environment The impact of people on their environment can be devastating. This is where the respective role of governments can make decisions that shape environmental policy and responsibilities. These governments can be broken up into four different levels: local, state, federal and international. Air quality and biodiversity are two current issues that can be related to the role of governments. Global warming is also another implication that has a devastating effect on the environment. Current examples include the rise in sea levels, polar meltdowns, the melting of ice sheets and glaciers and human deaths due to disease from the effects of global warming. Firstly the environment can be defined as the natural features of our surroundings such as plant and animal life and their habitats, water, soils and the atmosphere. A local government named Rockdale Municipal Council has implemented certain actions to deal with the quality in that region. They have recognized that the main source of poor air quality originates from air pollution sources such as motor vehicles, industrial premises and aircraft emissions. The solutions to these problems include improvements to Ryde and Botany Bay cycle way, integration of land use and transport planning strategies, production of Air Quality - the Facts booklet for community, investigation of complaints regarding odours and dust, tree planting and preparation of a Local Air Quality Management Plan in 1999. Air quality is a major issue in most states within Australia that affects our greenhouse, to tackle the implications state governments have created policies and responsibilities. For instance Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) is a program that enables mainly state governments to take action on greenhouse. CCP provides these state governments with a strategic framework to diminish greenhouse gas emissions by helping them identify and recognize the emissions of their council and community, set a reduction goal and develop and utilize an action plan to reach that goal. State actions include: capturing the methane from landfill sites and public and non-car transport into urban planning. On a federal or national basis Australia has employed policies to increase the air quality. For example the Commonwealth Government will guarantee that Australia carries its fair-share of the burden in worldwide efforts to combat global air pollution through policy development and implementation. They have also supported the National Greenhouse Strategy (NGS) which began in late 1996. The government will also support the development of a national strategy to observe and manage air toxics. The air toxics strategy will monitor, establish the levels of community exposure to, and manage emissions of selected air toxics. The federal government will even consider the inclusion of air toxics in a future National Environmental Protection Measure. Further measures include the leading of the development of national ambient air quality standards through the National Environmental Protection Council and the assistance of the establishment of a National Pollutant Inventory which will require large companies to publicly report their emission of 90 pollutants. Local government Rockdale Municipal Council has introduced responsibilities and policies to reduce the loss of biodiversity. This local government has learned that the cause involves the introduction of species, pollution of land and water, weed invasion and urban encroachment. Their solutions to these problems comprise of the planting of over 3,500 plants and shrubs in Bardwell Valley and Scotts Reserve, bush regeneration and planting in Scarborough Reserve, involvement in Cooks River Foreshores Working Party and preparation of a flora and fauna study in 2000. Policies towards the community include controlling noxious weeds on your property, planting native trees indigenous to the area and applying to the council prior to removing any trees. The Labor Tasmanian Government has created a new Environment Policy on biodiversity that hopes to preserve native plants and animals. The policies commit the government to encourage community involvement in biological diversity programs, proclaim the Tasman National Park, establish a State Biodiversity Committee with community representation to arrange a Tasmanian Biodiversity Strategy, support the development of a State Policy on the protection of remnant native vegetation, examine the possibility of incorporating the Biodiversity Strategy into legislation and seeking the co-operation of local government and the community in including and enforcing biological diversity guidelines in development criteria. The federal government has enabled several policies to deal with conservation of Australia's biodiversity. The government will support the National Reserve System program to expand Australia's National Parks, support off-reserve biodiversity conservation including the planting of trees and the protection of vegetation through the Bushcare program and work with the States to reduce unsustainable land clearing, develop an alert list of introduced plants and animals that pose a risk to our environment. The government will also maintain a ban on the export of live fauna; support research into Australia's floral and fauna assemblages as well as biodiversity conservation methods and ratify the Desertification Convention. An international conference held in Kyoto, Japan in December 1997 discussed issues on how best to reduce global warming. Kyoto Protocol negotiations have reached a legally binding agreement limiting the amount of gas emissions all industrialized countries. The protocol also included provisions for emission trading between industrialized countries. The overall nominal effect of the Kyoto protocol is for a reduction of 5.2% of emissions by 2010. However the agreement has many flaws and could lead to emission rising above 1990 levels. The protocol specifies that Japan must reduce emissions by 6%, USA by 7% and the European Union by 8%. The chairman of the conference negotiators, Raul Estrada said that further discussions were needed to find a way of implementing a system of trading in emissions. Trading allows countries that produce high levels of greenhouse gases, such as the USA,to buy the right to retain or even increase emissions. 15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)~~\\nGlobal warming refers to an expected rise in global average temperature due to the continued emission of greenhouse gases produced by industry and agriculture which trap heat in the atmosphere. Higher temperatures are expected to be accompanied by changing patterns of precipitation frequency and intensity, changes in soil moisture and a rise of the global sea level. To assess current examples relating to global warming, an examination is first needed on these examples. Sea levels could rise six feet and up in future centuries. The entire Amazon rainforest will be lost if the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases by more than 50%. But no matter whatever action the world takes to stop global warming, sea levels are set to rise and wipe out several island nations. The worst news is that whatever governments do to cut emissions, sea levels will rise by at least 2 metres over the next few hundred years, devastating Tuvalu and Kiribati in the Pacific and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean. Low-lying farmland and cities occupied by hundreds of millions of people will also be engulfed. Robert Nicholls of Middlesex University in London stated that thermal expansion of the ocean will continue for many hundreds of years after CO2 is stabilized, due to the gradual penetration of heat deeper and deeper into the ocean. All around the world ice sheets and glaciers are melting at a rate quite remarkably since record keeping began. A worldwide institute, based in Washington DC says that glaciers and other features are particularly sensitive to temperature shifts, and that scientists suspect the enhanced melting is among the first observable signs of human induced global warming. Some of the effects of global warming are as follows: arctic ocean sea ice shrunk by 6% since 1978, with a 14% loss of thicker year round ice, Greenland ice sheet has thinned by more than a metre a year on its southern and eastern edges since 1993 and 22% of glacial ice volume on the Tien Shan mountains has disappeared in the last 40 years. Worldwatch declared that the Earth's ice cover reflects much of the sun's heat back into space and the loss of much of it would affect the global, raise sea levels, and threaten water supplies. They also stated that the land and water left revealed by the retaining ice would themselves retain heat, creating a feedback loop that would speed up the warming process. The institute pronounced that the world's glaciers, taken as a whole, are now shrinking faster than they are growing. Worldwatch also warns of the outcomes of retaining ice on wildlife. In northern Canada reports of hunger and weight loss among polar bears have been associated with ice cover changes. And in Antarctica, sea loss, rising air temperatures and increased condensation are altering the habitats and the feeding and breeding patterns of seals and penguins. Cornell University ecologists believe that global warming may account for millions of human deaths from disease. David Pimentel a professor of ecology at Cornell stated and assumes that Most of the increase in disease is due to numerous environmental factors, including infectious microbes, pollution by chemicals and biological wastes and shortages of food and nutrients. Global warming will only make matters worse. Global warming will produce a favorable climate for disease producing organisms and plant pests. Global climate change will result in a net loss of obtainable food, for example the decline in rainfall (due to global warming) causes crop and plant production to die out. Infectious disease and environmental factors are to blame for more than 75% of all deaths in the world. Environmental disease may comprise of organic and chemical pollutants, including smoke from tabacco and wood sources. More than three billion people are malnourished. Malnutrition increases vulnerability to pollution-related illnesses and diseases such as diarrhea. Therefore Pimental concluded, we're seeing the first signs that global climate change can influence the incidences of human disease. And that this change combined with population growth and environmental degradation, will probably intensify world malnutrition and increases in other diseases as well. Melting is taking on vast and unprecedented level in the Arctic sea ice, the Antarctic and in dozens of mountain and sub-polar glaciers, and the rate has accelerated immensely in the past decade. The Earth's ice cover could have intense changes on the global climate and rising sea levels could start regional flooding. Melting of mountain glaciers could also endanger urban water supplies and the habitats of plant and animal species in fragile environments. Within the next 35 years, the Himalayan glacial area is expected to shrink by one-fifth, to just 100, 000 kilometres. A prediction forecasts that the remaining glaciers could disappear in 30 years. The melting has been especially noticeable in the past three decades, and scientists believe that it is the result of human behaviour and the build up of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. All current examples of global warming are significant due to the effects that it has on the environment and people. For people, it can cause infectious diseases and pollution-related illnesses that in turn effect our standard of living. Some examples can be more significant than others. For example diseases amongst people is more so important than the rise in sea levels and melting of glaciers since peoples existence are endangered\\n\\n		\\n		\\n		\\nIn Your Home – Conserve Energy \\n1.

Global warming is an increase in the earth's temperature, which can be caused by the use of fossil fuels, and industrial or agricultural processes. Man-made emissions are adding to the amount of carbon dioxide already being naturally released. These harmful processes have been leading to a large increase in the buildup of "greenhouse gases," which are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. Up until the industrial revolution the world did not have such a terrifying problem of dealing with the buildup of harmful gases in the atmosphere but now with the increasing population growth, increased fossil fuel burning, and.....

Silver was probably one of the first metals smelted from ore. Silver goes back to the times of the ancient Byzantine, Phoenician and Egyptian empires. Other than jewelry, silver has been forged into domestic utensils, buttons, boxes and other articles. Other than liquid mercury, silver is the brightest reflector among metals. This allows it to be polished to sheen. The Latin word for silver is Ag - Argentum that stands for 'white and shining'.\\n\\nAncient silver jewelry was handed down the generations among North and South American natives. Silver is extensively mined in the ores of Mexico and Peru. The comparatively low price of silver makes it a popular metal for jewelry, especially for fine and innovative designs. Silver jewelry craftsmen experiment with silver and later duplicate their patterns with gold.\\n\\nSilver jewelry is popular with women who want to achieve a less-formal look. Silver jewelry is popularly gifted to women and children. Even men can be gifted silver cuff links, tiepins or signet rings. It is representative of a tender emotion or a lovely memory. Sterling silver jewelry carries a stamp of sophistication without being over the top. Find out how to care for your silver jewelry.
Lesotho is one of the poorest countries in the world and is classified as a Least Developed Country. The apparel industry is the largest employer in Lesotho. It has been built on the preferential trade opportunities created by the US Growth & Opportunity Act (AGOA) and is working on moving up the value chain to create a niche market as an ethical sourcing destination.\\n    The Apparel Lesotho Alliance to Fight AIDS (ALAFA) is an industry-wide programme providing prevention and treatment for the 46000 mainly women workers in the industry. This is helping to combat two of the key drivers of the HIV/AIDS edpidemic: poverty and gender inequality. Surveys within the industry show that 43% of employees are HIV-postive.\\n    The creation of ALAFA was driven by humanitarian concerns and the need to make the industry sustainable in the long term. It was launched in May 2006 in Maseru.\\n    ALAFA is a direct beneficiary of the ONE T-shirt campaign by the Campaign to Make Poverty History and receives a donation from every T-shirt sold.
== Herpes ==\\nHerpes is a viral infection disease causing small painful blisters and inflammation, most commonly at the junction of skin and mucous membrane in the mouth or nose or in the genitals areas. It is more common in women than in men possibly because male to female transmission is more efficient than female to male transmission. Oral herpes causes cold sores around the mouth or face. Genital herpes affects the genitals, buttocks or anal area. The virus can spread even when sores are not present. Mothers can also infect their babies during childbirth. Some people have no symptoms. Others get sores near the area where the virus has entered the body. They turn into blisters, become itchy and painful, and then heal. The virus can be dangerous in newborn babies or in people with weak immune systems. \\n           Most people have outbreaks several times a year. Over time, you get them less often. Medicines to help your body fight the virus can help lessen symptoms and decrease outbreaks. Correct usage of latex condoms can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading herpes. Most people get Herpes Simplex Virus type - 1 infections, which cause cold sores, during infancy or childhood. They usually get it from close contact with family members or friends who carry the virus. It can be transmitted by kissing, sharing eating utensils, or by sharing towels. The sores most commonly affect the lips, mouth, nose, chin, or cheeks and occur shortly after exposure. Patients may barely notice any symptoms or find these sores annoying and seek medical attention. Most people get Herpes Simplex Virus type - 2 infections, which cause genital sores, following sexual contact with an infected person. The virus affects anywhere between five and twenty million people, up to 20% of all sexually active adults in the United States.\\nThe lesions of both types of herpes simplex can be spread by touching an unaffected part of the body immediately after touching a herpes lesion.

\\nLove is an emotion of a strong affection and personal attachment.[1] Love is also a virtue representing all of human kindness, compassion, and affection; and "the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another".[2] Love may also be described as actions towards others or oneself based on compassion, or as actions towards others based on affection.[3] In English, love refers to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from pleasure ("I loved that meal") to interpersonal attraction ("I love my partner"). "Love" may refer specifically to the passionate desire and intimacy of romantic love, to the sexual love of eros, to the emotional closeness of familial love, to the platonic love that defines friendship,[4] or to the profound oneness or devotion of religious love.[5] This diversity of uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states. Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts.[6] Love may be understood as part of the survival instinct, a function to keep human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.
'''Introduction:'''\\n\\nFlood is a common phenomenon in Bangladesh. Flood related crises have a gender dimension and affect women, the silent gender, more than men, who have the least capacity to deal with the situation for a variety of cultural, economical, historical, political and social reasons. Floods hit women harder, not just because they are physically weaker, but because of their reproductive capacity, physical responsibility for children and vulnerable socio-economic status. The patriarchal social structure and norms, gendered economics and gendered culture of Bangladesh, underpinned by religious traditions restrict the mobility of women during floods. Wider household responsibilities of women like food processing and cooking, cleaning, collecting water and fuel, bearing and rearing children looking after livestock and income generation also become much more difficult to perform under flood conditions. This article is attempted to highlight how women become more vulnerable by their social status, both during and after the full impact of floods and also the strategies adopted by flood victim women, which are crucial for the household survival.\\n\\n\\n'''Flood and its causes:'''\\n\\nThe origins of floods in Bangladesh are diverse. Floodwater may come from three main sources:\\n\\n	Rivers\\n	Rainfall\\n	Sea\\n\\nThree together or independently, may all generate more water that can’t be drained quickly from the land. However, the specific causes of floods vary from region to region. Several explanations have been addressed here:\\n\\n	Confluence of the major rivers\\n	High monsoon rainfall\\n	Rise of sea level\\n	Siltation of rivers\\n	Flood control measures\\n	Deforestation\\n	Construction of Farakka barrage and others\\n\\nThe last three causes, flood control measures, deforestation and the construction of Farakka barrage, are not only due to natural environmental factors but also to social factors.\\n\\n'''Flood control measures and women:'''\\n\\nIn Bangladesh embankments have been used as a traditional flood control measure since long time. However, a number of studies and reports have pointed out the negative consequences of Flood Control and Drainage (FCD) and Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation (FCDI) projects: the benefits of these projects were not planned. Because such projects are often not based on the nature of the flood plain, they do not prevent flood but rather increase flood losses. Many embankments have had a negative effect on river regimes, land formation, agriculture and fisheries and on the overall environment. Researchers have pointed out that any step to control flooding should emphasize both the structural and non-structural methods. They have discussed the problems of floods and the negative consequences upon the environment, farmers (men), and fisheries and on many other aspects of life in Bangladesh. However, they have ignored the problems of women. There has been almost no discussion of the differential impact of flooding upon men and women and very little about its impact upon people in different socio-economic categories. Policy makers, however, have only recently started to think about the way in which women might be involved in different activities from men and have different experiences of flooding from men, They have agreed that women’s activities should be ‘visible’ in the development sector and therefore, should be integrated with development activities in the water sector (The Fourth Five Year Plan, 1995). There are only a few studies (e. g. Adnan, 1990; Hanchett, 1992) which briefly consider the situation of women during floods. FAP 14’s gender study was based on a few case studies of female-headed households and was not compared with men’s response.\\n\\n'''Problems faced by women during floods:'''\\n\\nDuring floods women face different types of problems. For example:\\n\\n	Women suffer from lack of food, clothing and shelter during floods. Owing to their lack of resources, poor women face greater problems than women in middle and rich households. They suffer from shortages of food and other essentials, resulting in increasing prices and a consequent decline in purchasing power. They often have to eat unusual food and adjust consumption patterns of this.\\n\\n	Unemployed men often sit idle or move elsewhere leaving their household members behind during floods. It is women, the household-based workers, who have to take responsibility for protecting their houses, children and other members of the family, livestock and belongings.\\n\\n	Traditional gender specific work, such as carrying water, cooking, caring for children and animals become too difficult for women during flood conditions. Especially gender-assigned tasks like procuring food and providing drinking water, storing fuel and child care are such that women have to bear more physical burden of coping than men do. \\n\\n	Women’s assets such milch cows, poultry, trees, kitchen and utensils are particularly vulnerable to flood.\\n\\n	Domestic violence also increases during floods. Husbands beat their wives and children when food-supply run out in flood-stricken households.\\n\\n	Many women often become unwilling to go to flood shelters because of the Muslim culture ‘purdah’ which means that women should not show themselves to unrelated men.\\n\\n	During floods poor widow women confine to their houses for many days and have to drink flood water as they have neither the physical strength to reach tube wells, nor the economic means to hire a boat to collect clean water.\\n\\n	Bangladeshi women wear long 'Shari', which hinders their movement from one place to another during floods. It often entangles in fixed debris and limits the speed of evacuation. Again, poor women with only one Shari are often oblige to remain in wet cloth for most of the days for the lack of private space and to dry off.\\n\\n	Victim women often don’t have cloths to come out to take relief. Again, many women lose their breast-feeding infants in flood and suffer from puffed breast pain. There also happen cases of miscarriage which don’t get proper medication during floods. Pregnant and lactating women suffer from malnutrition i.e. lack of vitamin A, iodine and iron deficiencies, which result in eye diseases, night blindness, anemia, goiter etc.\\n\\n	In flood shelters women face several problems, which are related to their gender identity. For example, it becomes impossible for women to disregard their inhibition and go to latrines, which are open to all. They often have to wait till dark/night to ensure privacy to response the calls by nature, even changing the clothes/sanitary pad with menstrual blood.\\n\\n	While distributing relief in shelters, women are often pushed down and left behind in the rush by men. Again, child care, illness and conservatism keep many women away from taking relief goods. Women also give part of their food ration to their children consequently denying themselves the opportunity to maintain their strength and support their families.\\n\\n	Women who are in their own for whatever reason, whether they are single, widowed, abandoned, unaccompanied, lone heads of households or who have been separated from male family members by the chaos of the flood situations, often become victim of sexual violence in flood shelters.\\n\\n	Women are further vulnerable to the secondary impacts of floods due to socio-cultural and economic factors. When resources such as temporary shelter, fresh water, food and medicines are distributed, women are again marginalized. For example, in many cases women are unable to make decisions about whether loans should be secured to rebuild homes or to purchase crop seeds or other means to generate an income such as the purchase of a boat for transporting goods.        \\n\\n'''Coping mechanisms of women during floods:'''\\n\\nFloods affect both women and men but the burden of coping with flood falls heavily on women. The tasks women perform before, during and after floods, the problems they face and the coping mechanisms they adopt are related to women’s gender identity. Women in poorer categories often act as men do in making platforms, cutting bamboo, making bamboo bridges protecting crops and livestock and engaging in income generating activities. On the other hand, men usually remain more restricted to their gender-assigned activities. Some of the coping mechanisms of women have been highlighted here.\\n'''\\nWomen and water collection:'''\\n\\nThe collection of water during floods causes great problems for women. Women are usually responsible for collecting and storing water. During floods tube-wells, the most common source of pure drinking water in Bangladesh, go under water and poor women have to take considerable risks to procure drinking water from great distances. They have to walk through chest-high water or swim to collect fresh or clean water. Again, they have not enough fuel to boil water or fitciri to purify it with alum. However, they help each other to get pure drinking water from different sources.\\n\\n'''Sale of women’s assets:'''\\n\\nThe sale of assets is a common way for rural households to survive any crisis. Non-productive assets like milking cows or goats, jewellery or household items cannot usually produce a continuous income as land or cattle but they can easily be converted to cash and are therefore the first to be disposed off to meet the immediate needs of family survival. These assets usually belong to women, and they are often their only assets. They are sold, or mortgaged by their husbands to repay loans, to educate sons or to maintain the livelihood of the households. Both women and men resist changing their status from farmer to landless as long as they have other options to cope with crisis. Most women don’t have own valuable assets as men do. Even if they have some assets they are considered ‘less valuable’ or ‘non-productive’. However, women’s ‘non-productive’ assets become more ‘productive’ when they are disposed off during floods. Women’s assets are used to meet the immediate needs of the households during floods when men’s assets are kept for the future. \\n\\n'''Women and food preparation:'''\\n\\nDuring floods there is a great difference in the kind of food, the amount and the frequency of food preparation and the sources of food among women in different socio-economic categories. The food supplies of the poor, undernourished and malnourished at the best of times, are further reduced during the floods and it is women who have the responsibility for adjusting the household food consumption. Women’s work is closely related with agricultural production, family food and income generation and that is why the burden of food shortage falls upon them.\\n\\nMost of the poor households don’t have a reliable and stable source of food during floods. Women in these categories play a vital role in acquiring food from many sources, some of which are totally different from flood-free sources. When there is a shortage they try to manage food through their own efforts by gathering edible or wild plants and small amounts of low quality food such as rotten or discarded vegetables or accepting rice gruel from better-off women. Destitute and landless women maintain their livelihood by a hand-to-mouth existence. During floods the normal pattern of food consumption in the household changes. The price of staple food items becomes so high that it goes beyond the purchasing power of the poor. So, they often cook khesari or kalai dal (kind of inferior pulse), mania or cheer paddy, which they consider to be animal food, curry with fen (rice gruel) and chhatu (flour normally made of barley or chickpea or maize), kura (the red powdery coating of rice under the husk), lumps of flour burnt in the fire, one handful of rice with lots of water and chili, fried broken bits of grain and different aquatic plants. It is also evident that both women and men in poorer categories suffer from food shortages and women commonly sacrifice their own meals for their husbands and children.\\n\\n''' \\nWomen and common village resources:'''\\nDuring floods women become undernourished subsisting on a lean diet of vegetables, creepers and herbs. Their dependence on food from the common land increases greatly. When men fail to earn any money, they become helpless and do not feel it incumbent upon them to find alternative source of food for their families. Women, on the other hand, are much more capable than men of collecting food for families. They usually collect variety of food items from village common land like Shapla (the stem of the water lily) which women use as a major food item and is often mixed with others like kolmi shak (arum leaves) or kochumukhi (wild arum). \\n\\n'''Women and family health care:'''\\n\\nThere are some general flood-diseases, such as, diarrhea, viral fever, jaundice, skin diseases, conjunctivitis and swelling of limbs. It is evident that without any healthcare facilities from government or other organizations during floods, it is women who provide health care for the sick. Only women have knowledge about certain medicinal trees and they use herbs, roots and barks to cure family members from different types of diseases. Poorer women take risks to collect medicinal herbs from distant places during the floods despite purda restrictions. Men, on the other hand, rarely do such work because providing herbal treatment or nursing is not their gender-assigned role. Men in poorer categories also do not have the resources to get modern treatment. However, most women in the poorer categories, despite their own sickness and other activities, try their best to cure sick family members themselves in order to avoid the cost of modern treatment.\\n\\n'''Women and social network:'''\\n\\nWith little or no support from the government during floods, the women of poor households sick help from their social networks. Such support mainly comes from their own and that of their husbands’ kin and sometimes from patrons and neighbors. Women are able to get more support from such relationships than men. Relatives and neighbors provide shelter, lend food, supply loans with little or no interest, provide temporary employment and help with money, labor or materials to rebuild houses after floods. Men, on the other hand, do not show such ability to provide for their households. Borrowing small things or food is not a man’s responsibility and asking for help is often considered below their dignity.\\n\\n'''Recommendations:'''\\n\\nDuring floods where people as a whole are vulnerable, women are more vulnerable as they bear the burden of managing the survival of the household. Therefore, special attention should be given on after-flood rehabilitation program for women. For example:\\n\\n	There should be more female volunteers. In the case of major floods, male volunteers can not adequately meet women’s needs. \\n\\n	Women relief workers face higher security risks and obstructive ness from local male leaders and government officials when trying to carry out their work. More women volunteers should be available to form a strong group, able to overcome these problems collectively.\\n\\n	Female doctors and nurses should be included in the volunteer team, alongside a male medical team. Emergency medicine and equipment should be available to cope with women’s needs. For example, many women lost their breast-feeding infants during floods. Pumps to express breast milk must be available, in order to avoid serious infection and debilitating pain. Equipment and medication is needed to handle the inevitable miscarriages. \\n\\n	Poor women generally know fewer languages. So, local volunteers are needed to overcome language problems, in order to get access to the women more easily and to understand their specific needs.\\n\\n	During relief distribution women should be given first priority, and a separate distribution line needs to be organized for them as they have the additional responsibility for children.\\n\\n	In particularly conservative areas women may need house-to-house distribution as they face social obstacles to come to the distribution line to compete in the struggle for food supplies, elbowing and pushing, with men.\\n\\n\\n	As women must be fully clothed to go out to get food, clothing is an essential part of emergency relief.\\n     \\n'''Conclusion:'''\\n\\nThe inclusion of gender perspective in the study of flood is very pertinent and justified considering the context of Bangladesh. During floods where people as a whole are vulnerable, women become more vulnerable who bear the burden of managing the survival of household under crisis. Therefore, for effective flood management programs to be conceived and implemented successfully, gender specific awareness must be fully realized and accounted for. Since many women become disoriented and threatened by the loss of their homes, flood management policies need to be sensitive and aware of the meaning and significance of home and the implications for dealing with female flood victims. To reduce the vulnerability of women during floods specific programs should be devised and implemented that raise the awareness of women to the risks they face and also the range of adjustments that they can make. Such programs also need to be culturally and socially sensitive. Because of women’s significant contributions to their households’ survival during floods, their activities need to receive attention in government planning. \\n\\n \\n'''Bibliography:''' \\n\\nAhsan, Rosie Majid and Khatun.

Author: Eastine Charles Taneo\\n\\nDate published: March 10, 2012\\n\\n                       Deforestation has important implications for life on this planet. The transformation of forested lands by human actions represents one of the great forces in global environmental change and one of the great drivers of biodiversity loss. The impact of people has been and continues to be profound. Forests are cleared, degraded and fragmented by timber harvest, conversion to agriculture, road-building, fire, and in other ways. The effort to use and subdue the forest has been a constant theme in the transformation of the earth, in many societies, in many lands, and at most times. \\n\\n                       Forests are habitats and shelters to millions of species, reduce flooding, soil conserver, provide products for human use and consumption, give valuable ecosystem services.  They are home to more than half of all species living on land.  They also play several roles in the flooding because trees hold and use more water than farms or grasslands. With enough water, the river must rise above its banks and flood. The faster water runs from the watershed into the river, the higher a flood will be. Tree roots hold the soil in place, reducing the movement of sediment that can shrink river channels downstream and it can prevent soil erosion. Forests provide useful wood products.  Roundwood can be processed into building materials, or made into plywood products, furniture, etc. \\n\\n                       The following are factors of deforestation: logging, fires, urban construction, agriculture and commercial purposes.\\n\\n \\n\\n                     The first factor of deforestation is logging. Logging, both legal and illegal, is the cutting, skidding of trees in the forest. It is one of the major causes of deforestation in the world today. Trees that are cut-down are usually used by humans to trade. The logs are then generally transported to a saw mill to be cut into timber, a paper mill for paper pulp, of for other purposes like fence posts (Glastra, 1999). Logging is also tagged to the term “clearcutting”. It is a harvest method that removes essentially all the standing trees in a selected area (Glastra, 1999). A “clearcut” may or may not have reserve trees left to attain goals other than regeneration.\\n\\n                        There are different logging methods applied and some of these are “tree-length logging”, “full-tree logging”, and “cut-to-length logging”. Tree-length logging is a mechanized form of logging that involves felling and topping trees at the stump inside the cutblock or by the roadside (Wiki, 2009). The felled trees are then transported to the roadside or a landing site for hauling to a mill. Full-tree length is defined as trees are felled and transported to roadside with branches and top intact (Pulkki, no date). Transporting trees to the roadside is mainly by cable or grapple skidders. Cut-to-length method is trees are cut-off above the stump with stump height less than one-half butt diameter and bucked to various assortments directly in the stump area.\\n\\n                       The second factor of deforestation is fire. Forest fire is often used to signify an uncontrolled intense fire that breaks out in the wooded areas, grasslands, bushes, scrublands and peats due to many factors ranging from natural to man-made causes. It can easily spread to a vast area. It can also change its direction and overcome barriers like rivers and roads. Some of the causes of forest fires are natural such as lightning, and human activities and negligence like camp fire, lighted cigarettes (Bora, 2011) and kaingin system. Natural causes like lightning burns the trees and fire easily spread into the area.  About 14% of forest fires are due to lightning strikes (Dunn, 2009). Human activities and negligence are about 86% of forest fires (Dunn, 2009). Tourists or smokers sometimes leave camp fires or drop lighted items like cigarettes and matches in the forests which can easily set nearby bushes on fire and further develops into huge forest fire. On the other hand, kaingin or “slash-and-burn farming” system is an agricultural technique which involves intentional cutting and burning of trees in the forests to create fields. It includes a diverse collection of farming systems from long fallow shifting cultivation to short fallow shifting cultivation to forest pioneer farming. Unlike traditional farming methods that were used in harmony with the forests recuperative capacity, current slash-and-burn farming depletes the very soil resource upon which all agriculture and forestry depend. One of the strong commonalities of all slash-and-burn farmers is that they are among the poorest, most marginalized groups of their societies and have little or no influence on the important land use policy decisions made in their countries.\\n\\n                       The third cause of deforestation is urban construction. Forests are the way for residential houses, building and factories. Roads are building for trading and easier transports. This has made possible the needs of the social groups in the society. The cutting down of trees for lumber that is used for building materials, furniture, and paper products have a major impact on forest life. Forests are cleared to accommodate expanding urban areas.\\n\\n                       The fourth cause of deforestation is converting the forest to agricultural land. Trees in the forests are cut down to clear land for growing crops, build farms, ranches and other food growing lands. The economic consequences of deforestation and the process of becoming peasants are devastating. In contrast to the rich variety of foods the forest people are accustomed to plowing fields and peasants specialize in just four crops: rice, corn, tomatoes, and onions (Schelgel, 1999).  Hunting and fishing and gathering played almost no role at all in the cleared regions. The forests are gone and the rivers and creeks are seriously depleted. Commercial agriculture's role in deforestation is two-fold. First, agribusiness can indirectly result in deforestation. Commercial farms occupy the best and most fertile agricultural soils located in the valleys. This land is not available to the growing rural population that depends on agriculture for their subsistence. Without access to farmland in their immediate area, farming families have had to relocate to less fertile and less productive forested land. Second, agribusiness can be a direct cause of deforestation. Through a concession agreement, land purchase, or an informal land occupation; companies take possession of forested land with the intention of converting it to another use.\\n\\n                       The fifth cause is cattle ranching and livestock grazing. A cattle ranching is a major cause of deforestation. Ranchers occupy large tracts of forests and clear the land themselves or they buy the improvements made by small farmers. Traditionally, ranchers favored the more easily managed range and pasture lands of the dry forest zones, but for the last four decades there has been intensive clearing of the forests. Open-range grazing as is practiced in the dry woodlands can be a major contributor to deforestation when herd populations exceed the carrying capacity of the range. It can also seriously degrade the composition and quality of the forest when practiced too intensively.\\n                       The sixth cause of deforestation is mining and oil exploration that are locally important to deforestation. Large mines consumed vast quantities of indigenous woodlands to supply fuel to their smelting operations before plantations of fast-growing species were established (Lovekar, 2011). Oil exploration activities, such as the clearing of the seismic lines in the forests not only destroy the forests but also open them up to colonization by subsistence farmers who follow the exploration crews. The impact of gold mining has been widely publicized but its negative impacts have affected the indigenous peoples and the quality of the water more than the adjacent forests.\\n\\n                       The effects of deforestation may include loss of topsoil, disruption of the water cycle, loss of biodiversity, loss of potential discoveries, flooding and drought and climate change.\\n\\n                      First effect of deforestation is the loss of topsoil. Deforestation results in rapid degradation of nutrient rich topsoil. Heavy rainfall and high sunlight quickly damage the topsoil in clearings of forests. When these forests are cut-and-burnt, nutrients are released in the form of ash (Schlegel, 1999). This allows for a year or two of good crop on the newly cleared virgin land but eventually the nutrients will be washed away by the heavy tropical rain.\\n\\n                       Second effect of deforestation is the disruption of the water cycle. In the water cycle there are only a few processes that give water back to the atmosphere, such as transpiration, expiration and evaporation. Transpiration is the process by which water is loss from plants to the atmosphere (Starr, 2006). So, if plants are removed, especially at a high rate such as deforestation, there will be less water returning in the atmosphere. This will eventually cause a reduction in the amount of water returning the earth's surface such as the seas, lakes, rivers etc.\\n\\n                       Third effect is the loss of biodiversity. Biodiversity is the sum of all species occupying a specified area during a specified interval, past as well as present (Starr, 2006). Deforestation affects biological diversity by the destruction of natural habitats, which forces species out of their native areas. Isolation and fragmentation restrict their range, forcing them into unnatural and restrictive habitats, which may lead to their extinction. Temperature changes caused by loss of the protective canopy of the forest also contribute to this. Deforestation through clear-cutting creates a patched look to the landscape. Not only is this unpleasant to the eye, but it is terrible to the local wildlife. For other species, fragmented landscapes become population sinks that are sustained by immigration from nearby forest tracts (Schlegel, 1999). \\n\\n                       The fourth effect is the loss of potential discoveries. There is the possibility that the basic elements of potential medical treatments, cures and vaccines may lie undiscovered within these environments. The key active ingredient in one-fourth of the world’s prescription and non-prescription drugs come from plants growing in tropical rain forests. Fewer trees translate into an insecure future for forest workers. Some indigenous peoples’ way of life and survival are threatened by the loss of forests. Often, the stakeholders associated with forest areas are not always consulted before clearcutting occurs. This has sometimes lead to non-violent and violent confrontation and fueled bitter rivalries between area residents, the forest sector and environmentalists.\\n\\n                        The fifth effect is flooding and drought. One of the functions of forests is to absorb and store great amounts of water quickly when there are heavy rains. When the trees are cut down, it will not regulate or hold the flow of the water which leads to flooding and alters to drought. Deforestation causes a lack of soil cohesion and, because tree roots absorb water from the soil and allow it to absorb more water, it creates an ideal environment for flooding. A flat, treeless surface is perfect for flash floods. Flash flood has been the deadliest disaster that struck and killed hundreds of people in the cities of Cagyan de Oro and Iligan (Villanueva, 2011) last December  2011.\\n\\n                       The sixth effect of deforestation is global warming. Global warming is a phenomenon (greenhouse effect) whereby solar radiation that has reflected back off the surface of the earth remains trapped at atmospheric levels, due to the build-up of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, rather than being emitted back into space (Starr, 2006).\\n\\nThe major greenhouse gases and their sources/causes are:\\n\\nCarbon dioxide (CO2)\\n	-Fossil fuel, deforestation, animal respiration.\\n\\nMethane (CH4)\\n	-Cattle, rice paddies, gas leaks, termites, mining\\n\\nNitrous oxide (N2O)\\n	-Burning of fossil fuels, deforestation.\\n\\nChlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)\\n	-Air conditioning, solvents                             \\n\\nOzone (O3) and other trace gases\\n	-Car exhaust, power plants, photochemicals. \\n\\n\\n                       Global temperature is also rising. Different studies have shown the world’s average temperature has risen by 0.5o F-1.0o F on an average (Lovekar, 2011). The rise in the mean surface air temperature over the past hundred years supports this long term estimate. It is unknown whether the rise is part of Earth’s natural climate cycle or a result of the increase in greenhouse gases from human activity. A study in Canada, analyzing ground surface temperature, has found a one to two degree increase in ground surface temperature at the time of deforestation at each site (Swemson, 2011).\\n\\n                        The possible ways to protect and preserve the forests may include the following: reforestation, educating the farmers about deforestation, strict implementation of law about the problem, sustainable forest and water management.\\n\\n                       The first way is reforestation. It is causing a forest to occur again. This can be done by letting deforested land go fallow for several years or by replanting native species in open areas or adjacent to remaining forest. Here in Mindanao, some government and non-government organizations are doing tree planting projects. They plant trees to lessen the effect of climate change and recover what has been damaged by logging in the forest. The Philippine government supplies the seedlings but according to Pres. Benigno Aquino III there is an inadequate supply of seedlings that we could use in the country (Porcalla, 2011).\\n\\n                       The second way is educating the farmers.  There are peasant farmers who have left their traditional farm lands in search of new opportunities on the forest frontier. With a growing local population, restricted access to arable land, and few economic alternatives they have been forced to migrate to forested state lands to establish a new farm and homestead. They become prisoners of illiteracy and endemic poverty, and driven by the lack of access to arable lands and the lack of alternative employment opportunities, subsistence farming families must survive by clearing the forests to plant their crops. Though education, they can be responsible farmers. They must know the importance of our forests. The government may also give them alternative source of income like sustainable livelihood projects instead of clearing the forest to be converted in agricultural lands.\\n\\n                       The third way is the strict implementation of the laws concerning about deforestation. The authorities must strictly impose penalties to the one who breaks the law. Here in our country, Philippines, these are examples of the law of our government to fight deforestation: DENR Memorandum No. 52 and Executive Order No. 23.\\n\\n                      DENR(Department of Environment and Natural Resources) Memorandum No. 52 is limiting the processing of application permits of forest tenure holders within their plantation sites only (Villanueva, 2011). Environment and Natural Resources Ramon Paje announced last year, 2011, that chainsaws, bulldozers graders, and other logging tools and implements are now off-limits in natural and residual forests nationwide.\\n\\n                       Executive Order No. 23 is declaring a logging ban. President Benigno Aquino III issued the ban after visiting the provinces hit by floods and landslides in the country.\\n\\n                       The fourth way is sustainable forest and water management. According to Dr. Victor Rex Cruz, dean of the UP College of Forestry and Natural Resources, a sustainable forest management program to put in a place to assure sustainable harvest from natural forest, more investments in plantations and tree industries, and protection of watershed and protected areas while assuring the continuity of forest products and environmental services from all types of forests (Porcalla, 2011).\\n\\n                        Therefore, deforestation has a great impact in our society. It threatens not only biodiversity but it also endangers us humans which should protect the forest. It is true that it gives economic improvement to us but it also gives bad environmental effects. Controlling the problem is not a simple matter of enacting new laws and enforcing new regulations because laws and regulations already exist. What we need to do is to follow and obey this laws and regulations to lessen the bad effects of deforestation. We should be part of the solution and not adding to the problem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n•	Bora, C.

Environmental issues in India are many. Air pollution, water pollution, garbage pollution and wildlife natural habitat pollution challenge India. The situation was worse between 1947 through 1995. According to data collection and environment assessment studies of World Bank experts, between 1995 through 2010, India has made one of the fastest progress in the world, in addressing its environmental issues and improving its environmental quality.[1][2] Still, India has a long way to go to reach environmental quality similar to those enjoyed in developed economies. Pollution remains a major challenge and opportunity for India.\\n\\nSome believe economic development is leading to environmental issues in India. Others believe economic development is key to improving India's environmental management and preventing pollution in India.\\n\\nSome suggest India's growing population is the primary cause of India's environmental degradation. Systematic studies challenge this theory. Empirical evidence from countries such as Japan, England and Singapore, each with population density similar or higher than India, yet each enjoying environmental quality vastly superior than India, suggests population density may not be the only factor affecting India's issues.[3]\\n\\nMajor environmental issues are forest and agricultural degradation of land, resource depletion (water, mineral, forest, sand, rocks etc.), environmental degradation, public health, loss of biodiversity, loss of resilience in ecosystems, livelihood security for the poor.[4]\\n\\nThe major sources of pollution in India include the rampant burning of fuelwood and biomass such as dried waste from livestock as the primary source of energy,[5] lack of organized garbage and waste removal services, lack of sewage treatment operations, lack of flood control and monsoon water drainage system, diversion of consumer waste into rivers, cremation practices near major rivers, government mandated protection of highly polluting old public transport, and continued operation by Indian government of government owned, high emission plants built between 1950 to 1980.[6][7][8][9][10]\\n\\nIndia's water supply and sanitation issues are related to many environmental issues.\\n\\nEnvironmental issues are one of the primary causes of disease, health issues and long term livelihood impact for India.\\nContents\\n [hide] \\n\\n    * 1 History\\n    * 2 Major issues\\n          o 2.1 Population growth and environmental quality\\n    * 3 Pollution\\n          o 3.1 Water pollution\\n          o 3.2 Recent efforts to address water issues\\n          o 3.3 Air pollution\\n          o 3.4 Solid waste pollution\\n          o 3.5 Noise pollution\\n          o 3.6 Land pollution\\n    * 4 Environmental issues and Indian law\\n    * 5 Conservation\\n    * 6 See also\\n    * 7 References\\n    * 8 Further reading\\n    * 9 External links\\n\\n[edit] History\\nAshoka Pillar Edicts were one of earliest efforts in India focussed on respecting and preserving environment, forests and wildlife.\\n\\nYajnavalkya Smriti, a historic Indian text on statecraft and jurisprudence, suggested to have been written before 5th century AD, prohibited the cutting of trees and prescribed punishment for such acts. Kautalya's Arthashastra, written in India's Mauryan period, emphasized the need for forest administration. Ashoka went further, and his Pillar Edicts expressed his view about the welfare of environment and biodiversity.\\n\\n    "Happiness in this world and the next is difficult to obtain without much love for the dhamma, much self-examination, much respect, much fear of evil, and much enthusiasm. [...] Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi (Ashoka), speaks thus: Animals were declared to be protected – parrots, mainas, aruna, geese, wild ducks, nandimukhas, gelatas, bats, queen ants, terrapins, boneless fish, vedareyaka, gangapuputaka, sankiya fish, tortoises, porcupines, squirrels, deer, bulls, okapinda, wild asses, wild pigeons, domestic pigeons and all four-footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible. Also protected were nanny goats, ewes and sows which are with young or giving milk to their young, and so are young ones less than six months old. Cocks are not to be caponized, husks hiding living beings are not to be burnt, and forests are not to be burnt either without reason or to kill creatures. One animal is not to be fed to another. Our king killed very few animals."\\n\\n    — Ashoka's Seven Pillar Edicts[11]\\n\\nBritish rule of India saw several laws related to environment. Amongst the earliest ones were Shore Nuisance (Bombay and Kolaba) Act of 1853 and the Oriental Gas Company Act of 1857. The Indian Penal Code of 1860, imposed a fine on anyone who voluntarily fouls the water of any public spring or reservoir. In addition, the Code penalised negligent acts. British India also enacted laws aimed at controlling air pollution. Prominent amongst these were the Bengal Smoke Nuisance Act of 1905 and the Bombay Smoke Nuisance Act of 1912. While these laws failed in having the intended effect, British-enacted legislations pioneered the growth of environmental regulations in India.\\n\\nUpon independence from Britain, India adopted a constitution and numerous British-enacted laws, without any specific constitutional provision on protecting environment. India amended its constitution in 1976. Article 48(A) of Part IV of the amended constitution, read: The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country. Article 51 A(g) imposed additional environmental mandates on the Indian state.\\n\\nOther Indian laws from recent history include the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1974, the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981. The Air Act was inspired by the decisions made at Stockholm Conference. The Bhopal gas tragedy triggered the Government of India to enact the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986. India has also enacted a set of Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules in 2000.\\n\\nIn 1985, Indian government created the Ministry of Environment and Forests. This ministry is the central administrative organisation in India for regulating and ensuring environmental protection.\\n\\nDespite active passage of laws by the central government of India, the reality of environmental quality mostly worsened between 1947 to 1990. Most of Indian economy was nationalized and owned by India, and regulations were mostly ignored by state run enterprises. Rural poor had no choice, but to sustain life in whatever way possible. The state governments of India often regarded environmental laws enacted by the central government as a mere paperwork formality. Air emissions increased, water pollution worsened, forest cover decreased.\\n\\nStarting in 1990s, reforms were introduced. Since then, for the first time in Indian history, major air pollutant concentrations have dropped in every 5 year period. Between 1992 to 2010, satellite data confirms India's forest coverage has increased for the first time by over 4 million hectares, a 7% increase.[12]\\n[edit] Major issues\\nFloods are a significant environmental issue for India. It causes soil erosion, destruction of wetlands and wide migration of solid wastes.\\n\\nAir pollution, poor management of waste, growing water scarcity, falling groundwater tables, water pollution, preservation and quality of forests, biodiversity loss, and land/soil degradation are some of the major environmental issues India faces today.[13]\\n\\nIndia's population growth adds pressure to environmental issues and its resources.\\n\\nEnvironmental issues in India include various natural hazards, particularly cyclones and annual monsoon floods. An estimated 60% of cultivated land suffers from soil erosion, waterlogging, and salinity. It is also estimated that between 4.7 and 12 billion tons of topsoil are lost annually from soil erosion.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe Indian Agricultural Research Institute of Parvati has estimated that a 3 °C rise in temperature will result in a 15 to 20% loss in annual wheat yields.[citation needed] These are substantial problems for a nation with such a large population depending on the productivity of primary resources and whose economic growth relies heavily on industrial growth. Civil conflicts involving natural resources—most notably forests and arable land—have occurred in eastern and northeastern states.\\n[edit] Population growth and environmental quality\\n\\nThere is a long history of study and debate about the interactions between population growth and the environment. According to the British thinker Malthus, for example, a growing population exerts pressure on agricultural land, causing environmental degradation, and forcing the cultivation of land of poorer and poorer quality. This environmental degradation ultimately reduces agricultural yields and food availability, causes famines and diseases and death, thereby reducing the rate of population growth. Population growth, because it can place increased pressure on the assimilative capacity of the environment, is also seen as a major cause of air, water, and solid-waste pollution. The result, Malthus theorized, is an equilibrium population that enjoys low levels of both income and environmental quality. Malthus suggested positive and preventative forced control of human population, along with abolition of poor laws.\\n\\nMalthus theory, published between 1798 and 1826, has been analyzed and criticized ever since. The American thinker Henry George, for example, observed with his characteristic piquancy in dismissing Malthus: "Both the jayhawk and the man eat chickens; but the more jayhawks, the fewer chickens, while the more men, the more chickens." Similarly, the American economist Julian Lincoln Simon criticised Malthus's theory.[14] He noted that the facts of human history have proven the predictions of Malthus and of the Neo-Malthusians to be flawed. Massive geometric population growth in the 20th century did not result in a Malthusian catastrophe. The possible reasons include: increase in human knowledge, rapid increases in productivity, innovation and application of knowledge, general improvements in farming methods (industrial agriculture), mechanization of work (tractors), the introduction of high-yield varieties of wheat and other plants (Green Revolution), the use of pesticides to control crop pests.[15]\\n\\nMore recent scholarly articles concede that while there is no question that population growth may contribute to environmental degradation, its effects can be modified by economic growth and modern technology.[16] Research in environmental economics has uncovered a relationship between environmental quality, measured by ambient concentrations of air pollutants and per capita income. This so-called environmental Kuznets curve shows environmental quality worsening up until about $5,000 of per capita income on purchasing parity basis, and improving thereafter.[17] The key requirement, for this to be true, is continued adoption of technology and scientific management of resources, continued increases in productivity in every economic sector, entrepreneurial innovation and economic expansion.\\n\\nOther data suggests that population density has little correlation to environmental quality and human quality of life. India's population density, in 2011, was about 368 human beings per square kilometer. Many countries with population density similar or higher than India enjoy environmental quality as well as human quality of life far superior than India. For example: Singapore (7148 /km2), Hong Kong-China (6349 /km2), South Korea (487 /km2), Netherlands (403 /km2), Belgium (355 / km2), Japan (337/ km2), England (395 /km2), the state of Florida (353 / km2), the state of New York (412 / km2), the state of Massachusetts (840 / km2), the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (523 / km2), the region of Île-de-France (974 / km2), and the region of Lombardy (417 / km2).\\n[edit] Pollution\\n[edit] Water pollution\\nSee also: Water supply and sanitation in India\\nHanskhali drainage canal, it passes contaminated water direct to the Ganges at Howrah, West Bengal. Sewage and drainage canals like this are the dominant cause of water pollution in India.\\n\\nA 2007 study finds that discharge of untreated sewage is single most important cause for pollution of surface and ground water in India. There is a large gap between generation and treatment of domestic wastewater in India. The problem is not only that India lacks sufficient treatment capacity but also that the sewage treatment plants that exist do not operate and are not maintained. Majority of the government-owned sewage treatment plants remain closed most of the time due to improper design or poor maintenance or lack of reliable electricity supply to operate the plants, together with absentee employees and poor management. The wastewater generated in these areas normally percolates in the soil or evaporates. The uncollected wastes accumulate in the urban areas cause unhygienic conditions and release pollutants that leaches to surface and groundwater.[18]\\n\\nA 1992 World Health Organization study is claimed to have reported that out of India's 3,119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial sewage treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities.[19] Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. A 1995 report claimed 114 Indian cities were dumping untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River.[20] Open defecation is widespread even in urban areas of India.[21][22] This situation is typical of India as well as other developing countries.\\n\\nAccording to another 2005 report, sewage discharged from cities and towns is the predominant cause of water pollution in India. Investment is needed to bridge the gap between 29000 million litre per day of sewage India generates, and a treatment capacity of mere 6000 million litre per day.[23] A large number of Indian rivers are severely polluted as a result of discharge of domestic sewage.\\n\\nThe Central Pollution Control Board, a Ministry of Environment & Forests Government of India entity, has established a National Water Quality Monitoring Network comprising 1429 monitoring stations in 27 states and 6 in Union Territories on various rivers and water bodies across the country. This effort monitors water quality year round. The monitoring network covers 293 rivers, 94 lakes, 9 tanks, 41 ponds, 8 creeks, 23 canals, 18 drains and 411 wells distributed across India.[24] Water samples are routinely analyzed for 28 parameters including dissolved oxygen, bacteriological and other internationally established parameters for water quality. Additionally 9 trace metals parameters and 28 pesticide residues are analyzed. Biomonitoring is also carried out on specific locations.\\n\\nThe scientific analysis of water samples from 1995 to 2008 indicates that the organic and bacterial contamination are severe in water bodies of India. This is mainly due to discharge of domestic wastewater in untreated form, mostly from the urban centers of India.\\n\\nIn 2008, the water quality monitoring found almost all rivers with high levels of BOD. The worst pollution, in decreasing order, were found in river Markanda (590 mg O/l), followed by river Kali (364), river Amlakhadi (353), Yamuna canal (247), river Yamuna at Delhi (70) and river Betwa (58). For context, a water sample with a 5 day BOD between 1 and 2 mg O/L indicates a very clean water, 3 to 8 mg O/L indicates a moderately clean water, 8 to 20 indicates borderline water, and greater than 20 mg O/L indicates ecologically-unsafe polluted water.\\n\\nThe Mithi River, which flows through the city of Mumbai, is heavily polluted.\\n\\nThe levels of BOD are severe near the cities and major towns. In rural parts of India, the river BOD levels were sufficient to support aquatic life.\\n\\nTotal coliform and fecal coliform densities in the rivers of India range between 500 to 100,000 MPN/100 ml.[24] The presence of coliform suggests that the water is being contaminated with the fecal material of humans, livestocks, pets and other animals. Rivers Yamuna, Ganga, Gomti, Ghaggar, Chambal, Mahi, Vardha are amongst the other most coliform polluted water bodies in India. For context, coliform must be below 104 MPN/100 ml,[25] preferably absent from water for it to be considered safe for general human use, and for irrigation where coliform may cause disease outbreak from contaminated-water in agriculture.[26][27]\\n\\nIn 2006, 47 percent of water quality monitoring stations in India reported a total average annual coliform levels above 500 MPN/100 ml. During 2008, 33 percent of all water quality monitoring stations reported a total coliform levels exceeding those levels, suggesting recent effort to add pollution control infrastructure and upgrade treatment plants in India, may be reversing the water pollution trend.\\n\\nTreatment of domestic sewage and subsequent utilization of treated sewage for irrigation can prevent pollution of water bodies, reduce the demand for fresh water in irrigation sector and become a resource for irrigation. Since 2005, Indian wastewater treatment plant market has been growing annually at the rate of 10 to 12 percent. The United States is the largest supplier of treatment equipment and supplies to India, with 40 percent market share of new installation.[28] At this rate of expansion, and assuming the government of India continues on its path of reform, major investments in sewage treatment plants and electricity infrastructure development, India will nearly triple its water treatment capacity by 2015, and treatment capacity supply will match India's daily sewage water treatment requirements by about 2020.\\n\\nWater resources have not been linked to either domestic or international violent conflict as was previously anticipated by some observers. Possible exceptions, notes a 2004 report, include some communal violence related to distribution of water from the Kaveri River and political tensions surrounding actual and potential population displacements by dam projects, particularly on the Narmada River.[29] A 1997 article claimed Punjab is another hotbed of pollution, for example, Buddha Nullah, a rivulet which run through Malwa region of Punjab, India, and after passing through highly populated Ludhiana district, before draining into Sutlej River, a tributary of the Indus river, is today an important case point in the recent studies, which suggest this as another Bhopal in making.[30]\\n\\nA joint study by PGIMER and Punjab Pollution Control Board in 2008, revealed that in villages along the Nullah, calcium, magnesium, fluoride, mercury, beta-endosulphan and heptachlor pesticide were more than permissible limit (MPL) in ground and tap waters. Plus the water had high concentration of COD and BOD (chemical and biochemical oxygen demand), ammonia, phosphate, chloride, chromium, arsenic and chlorpyrifos pesticide. The ground water also contains nickel and selenium, while the tap water has high concentration of lead, nickel and cadmium.[31] The Hindon River, which flows through the city of Ghaziabad, highly polluted and groundwater of this city has colored and poisoned by industrial effluents, Hindon Vahini is strongly opposing of water pollution activities.\\n\\nFlooding during monsoons worsens India's water pollution problem, as it washes and moves all sorts of solid garbage and contaminated soils into its rivers and wetlands.\\n\\nThe annual average precipitation in India is about 4000 billion cubic metres.[23] From this, with the state of Indian infrastructure in 2005, the available water resource through the rivers is about 1869 billion cubic meters. Accounting to uneven distribution of rain over the country each year, water resources available for utilization, including ground water, is claimed to be about 1122 billion cubic meters. Much of this water is unsafe, because pollution degrades water quality. Water pollution severely limits the amount of water available to Indian consumer, its industry and its agriculture.\\n\\nThe Ganges\\n\\nMillions depend on the polluted Ganges river.\\nMain article: Pollution of the Ganges\\n\\n    To know why 1,000 Indian children die of diarrhoeal sickness every day, take a wary stroll along the Ganges in Varanasi. As it enters the city, Hinduism’s sacred river contains 60,000 faecal coliform bacteria per 100 millilitres, 120 times more than is considered safe for bathing. Four miles downstream, with inputs from 24 gushing sewers and 60,000 pilgrim-bathers, the concentration is 3,000 times over the safety limit. In places, the Ganges becomes black and septic. Corpses, of semi-cremated adults or enshrouded babies, drift slowly by.\\n\\n    — The Economist on December 11, 2008[32]\\n\\nMore than 400 million people live along the Ganges River. An estimated 2,000,000 persons ritually bathe daily[citation needed] in the river, which is considered holy by Hindus. In the Hindu religion it is said to flow from the lotus feet of Vishnu (for Vaisnava devotees) or the hair of Shiva (for Saivites). The spiritual and religious significance could be compared to what the Nile river meant to the ancient Egyptians. While the Ganges may be considered holy, there are some problems associated with the ecology. It is filled with chemical wastes[citation needed], sewage and even the remains of human and animal corpses which carry major health risks by either direct bathing in the water, or by drinking (the Fecal-oral route).\\n\\nThe Yamuna\\n\\nThe Taj Mahal next to the polluted Yamuna river.\\nMain article: Yamuna\\n\\nNewsWeek describes Delhi's sacred Yamuna River as "a putrid ribbon of black sludge" where fecal bacteria is 10,000 over safety limits despite a 15-year program to address the problem.[33] Cholera epidemics are not unknown.[33] NewsWeek observes India's messy democracy is particularly ill equipped to handle the conflicting pressures of rapid growth and poverty. Even though India revised its national water policy in 2002 to encourage community participation and decentralize water management, the country's Byzantine bureaucracy ensures that it remains a "mere statement of intent." Responsibility for managing water issues is fragmented among a dozen different ministries and departments without any coordination. The government bureaucracy and state-run project department has failed to solve the problem, despite having spent many years and $500 million on this project.\\n[edit] Recent efforts to address water issues\\n\\nThe government of India envisions a US$100 billion project to interlink all major river networks in India.[34] This initiative would connect water-deficient areas to water-abundant ones by interlinking 37 Indian rivers.[35] One of the largest projects anywhere in the world, it would transfer water through 30 links across 9,600 kilometers. It would connect 32 dams and use 56 million tons of cement and 2 million tons of steel. The project aims a transformation of India's water treatment, management, transmission and distribution. The Indian government has proposed reforms to attract investment and privatization of its water networks. Water companies from all over the world have established a presence in India to pursue an estimated 70 projects worth several billion dollars in 20 Indian cities.[28] India is debating the social and environmental impact of this project. One of the first projects under consideration is the linking of Ken and Betwa rivers in northern India.\\n[edit] Air pollution\\nCooking fuel in rural India is prepared from a wet mix of dried grass, fuelwood pieces, hay, leaves and mostly cow/livestock dung. This mix is patted down into disc-shaped cakes, dried, and then used as fuel in stoves. When it burns, it produces smoke and numerous indoor air pollutants at concentrations 5 times higher than coal.\\nA rural stove using biomass cakes, fuelwood and trash as cooking fuel. Surveys suggest over 100 million households in India use such stoves (chullahs) every day, 2-3 times a day. Clean burning fuels and electricity are unavailable in rural parts and small towns of India because of poor rural highways and limited energy generation infrastructure.\\nAir pollution is high in Indian cities.\\nTraffic congestion on inadequate road infrastructure is a daily reality of India's urban centers. Slow speeds and idling vehicles produce, per trip, 4 to 8 times more pollutants and consume more carbon footprint fuels, than free flowing traffic. This 2008 image shows traffic congestion in Delhi.\\nSee also: Global warming in India\\n\\nFuel wood and biomass burning\\n\\nFuelwood and biomass burning is the primary reason for near-permanent haze and smoke observed above rural and urban India, and in satellite pictures of the country. Fuelwood and biomass cakes are used for cooking and general heating needs. These are burnt in cook stoves known as chullah or chulha in some parts of India. These cook stoves are present in over 100 million Indian households, and are used two to three times a day, daily. As of 2009, majority of Indians still use traditional fuels such as dried cow dung, agricultural wastes, and firewood as cooking fuel.[36] This form of fuel is inefficient source of energy, its burning releases high levels of smoke, PM10 particulate matter, NOX, SOX, PAHs, polyaromatics, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and other air pollutants.[5][37][38][39] Some reports, including one by the World Health Organization, claim 300,000 to 400,000 people die of indoor air pollution and carbon monoxide poisoning in India because of biomass burning and use of chullahs.[40] Burning of biomass and firewood will not stop, unless electricity or clean burning fuel and combustion technologies become reliably available and widely adopted in rural and urban India.\\n\\nIndia is the world's largest consumer of fuelwood, agricultural waste and biomass for energy purposes. From the most recent available nationwide study, India used 148.7 million tonnes coal replacement worth of fuelwood and biomass annually for domestic energy use. India's national average annual per capita consumption of fuel wood, agri wate and biomass cakes was 206 kilogram coal equivalent. In 2010 terms, with India's population increased to about 1.2 billion, the country burns over 200 million tonnes of coal replacement worth of fuel wood and biomass every year to meet its energy need for cooking and other domestic use. The study found that the households consumed around 95 million tonnes of fuelwood, one-third of which was logs and the rest was twigs. Twigs were mostly consumed in the villages, and logs were more popular in cities of India. The overall contribution of fuelwood, including sawdust and wood waste, was about 46% of the total, the rest being agri waste and biomass dung cakes. Traditional fuel (fuelwood, crop residue and dung cake) dominates domestic energy use in rural India and accounts for about 90% of the total. In urban areas, this traditional fuel constitutes about 24% of the total.[41]\\n\\nFuel wood, agri waste and biomass cake burning releases over 165 million tonnes of combustion products into India's indoor and outdoor air every year. To place this volume of emission in context, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the United States estimates that fire wood smoke contributes over 420,000 tonnes of fine particles throughout the United States – mostly during the winter months. United States consumes about one-tenth of fuelwood consumed by India, and mostly for fire place and home heating purposes. EPA estimates that residential wood combustion in the USA accounts for 44 percent of total organic matter emissions and 62 percent of the PAH, which are probable human carcinogens and are of great concern to EPA. The fuelwood sourced residential wood smoke makes up over 50 percent of the wintertime particle pollution problem in California.[42] In 2010, the state of California had about the same number of vehicles as all of India.\\n\\nIndia burns tenfold more fuelwood every year than the United States, the fuelwood quality in India is different than the dry firewood of the United States, and the Indian stoves in use are less efficient thereby producing more smoke and air pollutants per kilogram equivalent. India has less land area and less emission air space than the United States. In summary, the impact on indoor and outdoor air pollution by fuelwood and biomass cake burning is far worse in India.\\n\\nA United Nations study[43] finds firewood and biomass stoves can be made more efficient in India. Animal dung, now used in inefficient stoves, could be used to produce biogas, a cleaner fuel with higher utilization efficiency. In addition, an excellent fertilizer can be produced from the slurry from biogas plants. Switching to gaseous fuels would bring the greatest gains in terms of both thermal efficiency and reduction in air pollution, but would require more investment. A combination of technologies may be the best way forward.\\n\\nBetween 2001 and 2010, India has made progress in adding electrical power generation capacity, bringing electricity to rural areas, and reforming market to improve availability and distribution of liquified cleaner burning fuels in urban and rural area. Over the same period, scientific data collection and analysis show improvement in India's air quality, with some regions witnessing 30 to 65% reduction in NOx, SOx and suspended particulate matter. Even at these lower levels, the emissions are higher than those recommended by the World Health Organization. Continued progress is necessary.\\n\\nScientific studies conclude biomass combustion in India is the country's dominant source of carbonaceous aerosols, emitting 0.25 teragram per year of black carbon into air, 0.94 teragram per year of organic matter, and 2.04 teragram per year of small particulates with diameter less than 2.5 microns. Biomass burning, as domestic fuel in India, accounts for about 3 times as much black carbon air pollution as all other sources combined, including vehicles and industrial sources.[44]\\n\\nOther sources of pollution in Indian cities are vehicles and emissions from industry. Until 1992, India protected its automobile industry using license raj. Many two wheel, three wheel and four wheel vehicles lacked catalytic converters. Per vehicle emissions were amongst the highest in the world. The refining of oil and supply of fuel was owned, regulated and run by the government; the fuel quality was lax.\\n\\nIn 2005, India adopted emission standard of Bharat Stage IV for vehicles, which is equivalent to Euro IV European standards for vehicle emissions. Nevertheless, the old pre-2005 vehicles, and even pre-1992 vehicles are still on Indian streets.\\n\\nFuel adulteration\\n\\nSome Indian taxis and auto-rickshaws run on adulterated fuel blends. Adulteration of gasoline and diesel with lower-priced fuels is common in South Asia, including India.[45] Some adulterants increase emissions of harmful pollutants from vehicles, worsening urban air pollution. Financial incentives arising from differential taxes are generally the primary cause of fuel adulteration. In India and other developing countries, gasoline carries a much higher tax than diesel, which in turn is taxed more than kerosene meant as a cooking fuel, while some solvents and lubricants carry little or no tax. As fuel prices rise, the public transport driver cuts costs by blending the cheaper hydrocarbon into highly taxed hydrocarbon. The blending may be as much as 20-30 percent. For a low wage driver, the adulteration can yield short term savings that are significant over the month. The consequences to long term air pollution, quality of life and effect on health are simply ignored. Also ignored are the reduced life of vehicle engine and higher maintenance costs, particularly if the taxi, auto-rickshaw or truck is being rented for a daily fee.\\n\\nAdulterated fuel increases tailpipe emissions of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). Air toxin emissions — which fall into the category of unregulated emissions — of primary concern are benzene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), both well known carcinogens. Kerosene is more difficult to burn than gasoline; its addition results in higher levels of HC, CO and PM emissions even from catalyst-equipped cars. The higher sulfur level of kerosene is another issue. The permissible level of fuel sulfur in India, in 2002, was 0.25 percent by weight as against 0.10 percent for gasoline. The higher levels of sulfur can deactivate the catalyst. Once the catalyst becomes deactivated, the amount of pollution from the vehicle dramatically increases. Fuel adulteration is essentially an unintended consequence of tax policies and the attempt to control fuel prices, in the name of fairness. Air pollution is the ultimate result. This problem is not unique to India, but prevalent in many developing countries including those outside of south Asia. This problem is largely absent in economies that do not regulate the ability of fuel producers to innovate or price based on market demand.\\n\\nTraffic congestion\\n\\nTraffic congestion is severe in India's cities and towns. Traffic congestion is caused for several reasons, some of which are: increase in number of vehicles per kilometer of available road, a lack of intra-city divided-lane highways and intra-city expressways networks, lack of inter-city expressways, traffic accidents and chaos from poor enforcement of traffic laws.\\n\\nTraffic congestion reduces average traffic speed. At low speeds, scientific studies reveal, vehicles burn fuel inefficiently and pollute more per trip. For example, a study in the United States found that for the same trip, cars consumed more fuel and polluted more if the traffic was congested, than when traffic flowed freely. At average trip speeds between 20 to 40 kilometers per hour, the cars pollutant emission was twice as much as when the average speed was 55 to 75 kilometers per hour. At average trip speeds between 5 to 20 kilometers per hour, the cars pollutant emissions were 4 to 8 times as much as when the average speed was 55 to 70 kilometers per hour.[46] Fuel efficiencies similarly were much worse with traffic congestion.\\n\\nTraffic gridlock in Delhi and other India cities is extreme.[47] The average trip speed on many Indian city roads is less than 20 kilometers per hour; a 10 kilometer trip can take 30 minutes, or more. At such speeds, vehicles in India emit air pollutants 4 to 8 times more than they would with less traffic congestion; Indian vehicles also consume a lot more carbon footprint fuel per trip, than they would if the traffic congestion was less.\\n\\nIn cities like Bangalore, around 50% of children suffer from asthma.[48]\\n\\nRecent trends in India's air quality\\n\\nMonsoons scrub India's air, bringing its natural diversity in better view.\\nHimalayan peaks in eastern India on a day without haze.\\n\\nWith the last 15 years of economic development and regulatory reforms, India has made progress in improving its air quality. The table presents the average emissions sampled at many locations, over time, and data analyzed by scientific methods, by multiple agencies, including The World Bank. For context and comparison, the table also includes average values for Sweden in 2008, observed and analyzed by same methods. Over 1995-2008, average nationwide levels of major air pollutants have dropped by between 25-45 percent in India.\\nAir quality, trends over 1995-2008, averaged for India Air quality indicator[49] 	India 	India 	India 	Sweden\\n	1995 	2005 	2008 	2008\\nPollutant, PM10 (micrograms per cubic meter) 	109 	67 	59 	11\\nPollutant, CO2 emissions (kg per 2005 PPP$ of GDP) 	0.7 	0.6 	0.5 	0.2\\nHealth, mortality rate (under 5, per 1000) 	100 	73 	67 	3\\nPollutant, methane, Agriculture emissions (% total) 	68.8 	64.4 	n.a. 	28.1\\nPollutant, nitrous oxide, Agriculture emissions (% total) 	75.2 	73.4 	n.a. 	60.2\\n\\nIndia's Central Pollution Control Board now routinely monitors four air pollutants namely sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), suspended particulate matter (SPM) and respirable particulate matter (PM10). These are target air pollutants for regular monitoring at 308 operating stations in 115 cities/towns in 25 states and 4 Union Territories of India. The monitoring of meteorological parameters such as wind speed and direction, relative humidity and temperature has also been integrated with the monitoring of air quality. The monitoring of these pollutants is carried out for 24 hours (4-hourly sampling for gaseous pollutants and 8-hourly sampling for particulate matter) with a frequency of twice a week, to yield 104 observations in a year.\\n\\nFor 2010, the key findings of India's central pollution control board are:[50]\\n\\n    * Most Indian cities continue to violate India's and world air quality PM10 targets. Respirable particulate matter pollution remains a key challenge for India. Despite the general non-attainment, some cities showed far more improvement than others. A decreasing trend has been observed in PM10 levels in cities like Solapur and Ahmedabad over the last few years. This improvement may be due to local measures taken to reduce sulphur in diesel and stringent enforcement by Gujarat government.\\n    * A decreasing trend has been observed in sulphur dioxide levels in residential areas of many cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Bhopal during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced clean fuel standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood, and the use of LPG instead of diesel in certain vehicles.\\n    * A decreasing trend has been observed in nitrogen dioxide levels in residential areas of some cities such as Bhopal and Solapur during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced vehicle emission standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood.\\n    * Most Indian cities greatly exceed acceptable levels of suspended particulate matter. This may be because of refuse and biomass burning, vehicles, power plant emissions, industrial sources.\\n    * The Indian air quality monitoring stations reported lower levels of PM10 and suspended particulate matter during monsoon months possibly due to wet deposition and air scrubbing by rainfall. Higher levels of particulates were observed during winter months possibly due to lower mixing heights and more calm conditions. In other words, India's air quality worsens in winter months, and improves with the onset of monsoon season.\\n\\nFor its 2008 annual report, Central Pollution Control Board used 346 operating Air Quality Monitoring Stations, covering 130 cities / towns in 26 States and 4 Union Territories. With the weekly data collected and then averaged over the year, Central Pollution Control Board reported the following annual trends from 1998 to 2008:[24]\\n\\n    * The average annual SOx and NOx emissions level and periodic violations in industrial areas of India were significantly and surprisingly lower than the emission and violations in residential areas of India.\\n    * The 24-hour average PM10 and suspended particulate matter emissions and violations in almost all areas of India violated India's and WHO targets. The PM10 and suspended particulate matter concentrations, in industrial areas of India were, however, lower than those in residential areas of India. Residential areas of India were the source of over 90% of the most serious and repeated violations in particulate air pollution.\\n    * Of the four major Indian cities, air pollution was consistently worst in Delhi, every year over 5 year period (2004–2008). Kolkata was a close second, followed by Mumbai. Chennai air pollution was least of the four.\\n    * The states of Kerala and Meghalaya, relative to other Indian states, experienced on average some of lowest air pollution levels. The cities of Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam and Shillong, relative to other Indian cities and towns, experienced some of lowest air pollution levels.\\n    * Air Quality data collected from the monitoring station at Taj Mahal, Agra since year 1991 to 2008, suggests that both particulate and acid rain pollutants at Taj Mahal have been declining over the years. The 2008 average annual air pollutant concentrations were between 38 to 67% lower than those in 1991.\\n\\n[edit] Solid waste pollution\\nSolid waste adds to water pollution in India, a 2005 image.\\nTrash and garbage disposal services, responsibility of local government workers in India, are ineffective. Solid waste is routinely seen along India's streets and shopping plazas. Image shows solid waste pollution along a Jaipur street, a 2011 image.\\n\\nTrash and garbage is a common sight in urban and rural areas of India. It is a major source of pollution. Indian cities alone generate more than 100 million tons of solid waste a year. Street corners are piled with trash. Public places and sidewalks are despoiled with filth and litter, rivers and canals act as garbage dumps. In part, India's garbage crisis is from rising consumption. India's waste problem also points to a stunning failure of governance.[7]\\n\\nIn 2000, India's Supreme Court directed all Indian cities to implement a comprehensive waste-management program that would include household collection of segregated waste, recycling and composting. These directions have simply been ignored. No major city runs a comprehensive program of the kind envisioned by the Supreme Court. Indeed, forget waste segregation and recycling directive of the India's Supreme Court, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that up to 40 percent of municipal waste in India remains simply uncollected. Even medical waste, theoretically controlled by stringent rules that require hospitals to operate incinerators, is routinely dumped with regular municipal garbage. A recent study found that about half of India's medical waste is improperly disposed of.\\n\\nMunicipalities in Indian cities and towns have waste collection employees. However, these are unionized government workers and their work performance is neither measured nor monitored.\\n\\nSome of the few solid waste landfills India has, near its major cities, are overflowing and poorly managed. They have become significant sources of greenhouse emissions and breeding sites for disease vectors such as flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches, rats, and other pests.[51]\\n\\nIn 2011, several Indian cities embarked on waste-to-energy projects of the type in use in Germany, Switzerland and Japan.[52] For example, New Delhi is implementing two incinerator projects aimed at turning the city’s trash problem into electricity resource. These plants are being welcomed for addressing the city’s chronic problems of excess untreated waste and a shortage of electric power. They are also being welcomed by those who seek to prevent water pollution, hygiene problems, and eliminate rotting trash that produces potent greenhouse gas methane. The projects are being opposed by waste collection workers and local unions who fear changing technology may deprive them of their livelihood and way of life.[53]\\n\\nAlong with waste-to-energy projects, some cities and towns such as Pune, Maharashtra are introducing competition and the privatization of solid waste collection, street cleaning operations and bio-mining to dispose the waste. A scientific study suggests public private partnership is, in Indian context, more useful in solid waste management. According to this study, government and municipal corporations must encourage PPP-based local management through collection, transport and segregation and disposal of solid waste.[54]\\n[edit] Noise pollution\\n[icon] 	This section requires expansion.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court of India gave a significant verdict on noise pollution in 2005.[55] Unnecessary honking of vehicles makes for a high decibel level of noise in cities. The use of loudspeakers for political purposes and by temples and mosques make for noise pollution in residential areas because using more speakers in an programs the noise is increase.\\n\\nIn January 2010, Government of India published norms of permissible noise levels in urban and rural areas.[56]\\n[edit] Land pollution\\n\\nIn March 2009, the issue of Uranium poisoning in Punjab came into light, caused by fly ash ponds of thermal power stations, which reportedly lead to severe birth defects in children in the Faridkot and Bhatinda districts of Punjab.[57][58][59][60]\\n[edit] Environmental issues and Indian law\\n\\nSince about late 1980s, the Supreme Court of India has been pro-actively engaged in India's environmental issues. In most countries, it is the executive and the legislative branches of the government that plan, implement and address environmental issues; the Indian experience is different. The Supreme Court of India has been engaged in interpreting and introducing new changes in the environmental jurisprudence directly. The Court has laid down new principles to protect the environment, re-interpreted environmental laws, created new institutions and structures, and conferred additional powers on the existing ones through a series of directions and judgments. The Court’s directions on environmental issues goes beyond the general questions of law, as is usually expected from the highest Court of a democratic country. The Supreme Court of India, in its order, includes executive actions and technical details of environmental actions to be implemented. Indeed, some critics of India's Supreme Court describe the Court as the Lords of Green Bench or Garbage Supervisor. Supporters of India's Supreme Court term these orders and the Indian bench as pioneering, both in terms of laying down new principles of law, and in delivering environmental justice.[61]\\n\\nThe reasons for the increasing interjection of India's Supreme Court in governance arenas are, experts claim, complex. A key factor has been the failure of government agencies and the state owned enterprises in discharging their Constitutional and Statutory duties. This has prompted civil society groups to file public interest complaints with the Courts, particularly the Supreme Court, for suitable remedies.\\n\\nPublic interest litigation and judicial activism on environmental issues extends beyond India's Supreme Court. It includes the High Courts of individual states.\\n\\nIndia's judicial activism on environmental issues has, some suggest, delivered positive effects to the Indian experience. The Supreme Court has, through intense judicial activism, the proponents claim, become a symbol of hope for the people of India. As a result of judicial activism, India's Supreme Court has delivered a new normative regime of rights and insisted that the Indian state cannot act arbitrarily but must act reasonably and in public interest on pain of its action being invalidated by judicial intervention.[62]\\n\\nIndia's judicial activism on environmental issues has, others suggest, had adverse consequences. Public interest cases are repeatedly filed to block infrastructure projects aimed at solving environmental issues in India, such as but not limiting to water works, expressways, land acquisition for projects, and electricity power generation projects. The litigation routinely delays such projects, often for years, while rampant pollution continues in India, and tens of thousands die from the unintended effects of pollution. Even after a stay related to an infrastructure project is vacated, or a court order gives a green light to certain project, new issues become grounds for court notices and new public interest litigation.[63][64][65]\\n\\nJudicial activism in India has, in several key cases, found state-directed economic development ineffective and a failure, then interpreted laws and issued directives that encourage greater competition and free market to reduce environmental pollution. In other cases, the interpretations and directives have preserved industry protection, labor practices and highly polluting state-owned companies detrimental to environmental quality of India.[66]\\n[edit] Conservation\\nGreater adjutant perched on a pile of trash and solid waste in Assam.\\nThe world's rarest monkey, the golden langur.\\nForests of India's Western Ghats\\nForests of Kerala.

Poor air quality, water pollution and garbage pollution - all affect the food and environment quality necessary for ecosystems.\\n\\nIndia is a large and diverse country. Its land area includes regions with some of the world's highest rainfall to very dry deserts, coast line to alpine regions, river deltas to tropical islands. The variety and distribution of forest vegetation is large. India is one of the 12 mega biodiverse regions of the world.\\n\\nIndian forests types include tropical evergreens, tropical deciduous, swamps, mangroves, sub-tropical, montane, scrub, sub-alpine and alpine forests. These forests support a variety of ecosystems with diverse flora and fauna.\\n\\nUntil recently, India lacked an objective way to determine the quantity of forests it had, and the quality of forests it had.\\n\\nForest cover measurement methods\\n\\nPrior to 1980s, India deployed a bureaucratic method to estimate forest coverage. A land was notified as covered under Indian Forest Act, and then officials deemed this land area as recorded forest even if it was devoid of vegetation. By this forest-in-name-only method, the total amount of recorded forest, per official Indian records, was 71.8 million hectares. Any comparison of forest coverage number of a year before 1987 for India, to current forest coverage in India, is thus meaningless; it is just bureaucratic record keeping, with no relation to reality or meaningful comparison.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, space satellites were deployed for remote sensing of real forest cover. Standards were introduced to classify India's forests into the following categories:\\n\\n    * Forest Cover: defined as all lands, more than one hectare in area, with a tree canopy density of more than 10 percent. (Such lands may or may not be statutorily notified as forest area).\\n          o Very Dense Forest: All lands, with a forest cover with canopy density of 70 percent and above\\n          o Moderately Dense Forest: All lands, with a forest cover with canopy density of 40-70 percent\\n          o Open Forest: All lands, with forest cover with canopy density of 10 to 40 percent\\n          o Mangrove Cover: Mangrove forest is salt tolerant forest ecosystem found mainly in tropical and sub-tropical coastal and/or inter-tidal regions. Mangrove cover is the area covered under mangrove vegetation as interpreted digitally from remote sensing data. It is a part of forest cover and also classified into three classes viz. very dense, moderately dense and open.\\n          o Non Forest Land: defined as lands without any forest cover\\n    * Scrub Cover: All lands, generally in and around forest areas, having bushes and or poor tree growth, chiefly small or stunted trees with canopy density less than 10 percent\\n    * Tree Cover: Land with tree patches (blocks and linear) outside the recorded forest area exclusive of forest cover and less than the minimum mapable area of 1 hectare\\n    * Trees Outside Forests: Trees growing outside Recorded Forest Areas\\n\\nThe first satellite recorded forest coverage data for India became available in 1987. India and the United States cooperated in 2001, using Landsat MSS with spatial resolution of 80 meters, to get accurate Indian forest distribution data. India thereafter switched to digital image and advanced satellites with 23 meters resolution and software processing of images to get more refined data on forest quantity and forest quality. India now assesses its forest distribution data biennially. The 2007 forest census data thus obtained and published by the Government of India suggests the five states with largest area under forest cover as the following:[67]\\n\\n    * Madhya Pradesh: 7.64 million hectares\\n    * Arunachal Pradesh: 6.8 million hectares\\n    * Chhattisgarh: 5.6 million hectares\\n    * Orissa: 4.83 million hectares\\n    * Maharashtra: 4.68 million hectares\\n\\nIndia hosts significant biodiversity; it is home to 7.6% of all mammalian, 12.6% of avian, 6.2% of reptilian, and 6.0% of flowering plant species.[68]\\n\\nIn recent decades, human encroachment has posed a threat to India's wildlife; in response, a system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was substantially expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial habitat; further federal protections were promulgated in the 1980s. Along with over 500 wildlife sanctuaries, India now hosts 14 biosphere reserves, four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; 25 wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.\\n\\nThese laws did not have the effect they intended.\\n\\nIn 1985, India created the Ministry of Environment and Forests. This was followed by a National Forest Policy and the major government reforms of early 1990s.\\n\\nOver the last 20 years, India has reversed the deforestation trend. Specialists of the United Nations report India's forest as well as woodland cover has increased. A 2010 study by the Food and Agriculture Organization ranks India amongst the 10 countries with the largest forest area coverage in the world (the other nine being Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, United States of America, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Australia, Indonesia and Sudan).[12] India is also one the top 10 countries with the largest primary forest coverage in the world, according to this study.\\n\\nFrom 1990 to 2000, FAO finds India was the fifth largest gainer in forest coverage in the world; while from 2000 to 2010, FAO considers India as the third largest gainer in forest coverage.[12]\\n\\nNational Forest Commission and India's afforestation program\\n\\nIn 2003, India set up a National Forest Commission to review and assess India's policy and law, its effect on India's forests, its impact of local forest communities, and to make recommendations to achieve sustainable forest and ecological security in India.[69] The report made over 300 recommendations including the following:\\n\\n    * India must pursue rural development and animal husbandry policies to address local communities need to find affordable cattle fodder and grazing. To avoid destruction of local forest cover, fodder must reach these communities on reliable roads and other infrastructure, in all seasons year round.\\n    * The Forest Rights Bill is likely to be harmful to forest conservation and ecological security. The Forest Rights Bill became a law since 2007.\\n    * The government should work closely with mining companies. Revenue generated from lease of mines must be pooled into a dedicated fund to conserve and improve the quality of forests in the region where the mines are located.\\n    * Power to declare ecologically sensitive areas must be with each Indian state.\\n    * The mandate of State Forest Corporations and government owned monopolies must be changed.\\n    * Government should reform regulations and laws that ban felling of trees and transit of wood within India. Sustainable agro-forestry and farm forestry must be encouraged through financial and regulatory reforms, particularly on privately owned lands.\\n\\nIndia's national forest policy expects to invest US$ 26.7 billion by 2020, to pursue nationwide afforestation coupled with forest conservation, with the goal of increasing India's forest cover from 20% to 33%.[70]
I am a scientist at a university in the American Pacific Northwest studying structural and molecular parasitology.  I look for parasite genes that could be vulnerable to antiparasitic drugs and examine the structures of target parasite proteins for ways to make drugs more potent and less toxic to people.  My focus is to develop better treatments for Trypanosoma cruzi infection, the cause of Chagas disease, and related trypanosomatid Leishmania species.  Along with lab science, I have done advocacy and community building work on affordability of medicines to people living in poverty and development of new health technologies (drugs, diagnostics, vaccines) for neglected infections of poverty.
{{onesource|date=December 2015}}\\n{{short description|Type of emergency that causes severe environmental damage}}\\nAn '''environmental emergency''' is defined as a "sudden-onset disaster or accident resulting from natural, technological or human-induced factors, or a combination of these, that causes or threatens to cause severe environmental damage as well as loss of human lives and property." (UNEP/GC.22/INF/5, 13 November 2002.)\\n\\nFollowing a disaster or conflict, an environmental emergency can occur when people's health and livelihoods are at risk due to the release of hazardous and noxious substances, or because of significant damage to the ecosystem. Examples include fires, [[oil spill]]s, [[chemical accident]]s, [[toxic waste dump]]ing and [[groundwater pollution]]. \\n\\nThe environmental risks can be acute and life-threatening. According to the International Disaster Database ([http://www.emdat.be/ EM-DAT]), between 2003 and 2013, there were 380 industrial accidents reported, affecting 207 668 people and resulting in over US$22 million in losses. Climate change is having an unprecedented effect on the occurrence of natural disasters and the associated risk of environmental emergencies. With climate change already stretching the disaster relief system, future climate-related emergency events will generate increased and more costly demands for assistance.\\n\\n== Context ==\\nAll disasters have some environmental impacts.  \\n\\nSome of these may be immediate and life-threatening – for example, when an earthquake damages an industrial facility, which in turn releases hazardous materials. In such cases these so-called 'secondary impacts' may cause as much damage as the initial causal factor. \\n\\nFor example, [[Typhoon Haiyan]]/Yolanda that struck the Philippines in November 2013, caused massive destruction and had a huge human toll but also generated a spill of around 800,000 litres of heavy oil, when a power barge ran aground in Estancia, Iloilo province, at the height of the typhoon. \\n\\nDisasters may also have longer-term impacts. For example, natural disasters may cause long-term waste management difficulties or [[ecosystem]] damage.\\n\\n== Major international conferences ==\\nThe Environmental Emergencies Forum is a unique biennial international forum that brings together disaster managers and environmental experts from governments, [[UN]] agencies, industries, academies, NGOs and civil society to improve prevention, preparedness, response and overall resilience to environmental emergencies. It also provides guidance for the Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit, which provides a Secretariat to the meeting. The most recent meeting was held in Norway in June 2015.

Authorities continue to ban or disperse most public demonstrations. Politicians and journalists critical of the government face violence and intimidation and are barred from equal access to the broadcast media. In addition, the judiciary remains weak and subject to political influence. Trafficking of women and children for sexual exploitation through networks protected or backed by police or government officials is rampant. The government continues to turn a blind eye to fraudulent confiscation of farmers’ land, illegal logging, and widespread plundering of natural resources.\\n\\nPolitician, particularly those speeching on abuse of power or corruption and democracy, were at risk of investigation by the police on charges of his political opinions.\\n\\n* In June, Batzandan Jalbasuren, the head of the Just Society Civic Movement was detained for 41 days in a pre-trial detention centre. He was sentenced to Capital punishment by a district court for organising the demonstrations against the Government. In addition, Enkhbayar Davaa, the coordinator of the Just Society Civic Movement, is wanted by the police because of the organising of demonstrations.
What is CGIF?\\n\\nThe CGIF was established in November 2010 to promote financial stability and to boost long-term investment in the ASEANa+3 region (the "Region"). CGIF will provide guarantees on local currency denominated bonds issued by corporations in the Region. Such guarantees will make it easier for corporations to issue local currency bonds with longer maturities. This will help reduce the currency and maturity mismatches that caused the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis and make the Region's financial system more resilient to volatile global capital flows and external shocks. \\n\\nWhat are the priorities of CGIF? What kind of activities may be guaranteed by the facility?\\n\\nThe aim of CGIF is to help companies that otherwise would have difficulty tapping local bond markets to secure longer-term financing, reduce their dependency on short-term foreign currency borrowing to mitigate currency and maturity mismatches. Increased issuances of local currency bonds will promote financial stability in the Region and aid the development of ASEAN's bond markets.\\n\\nWho are eligible for CGIF guarantees?\\n\\nCGIF will provide guarantees for local currency denominated bonds issued by investment grade corporations in the Region.\\n\\nWho supports the fund?\\n\\nCGIF has received capital contributions of $700 million from ASEAN, the People's Republic of China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and ADB.\\n\\na ASEAN member countries: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam.
I never find it easy to write about myself, particularly when this is being posted to an open access website like Wikipedia and when I am using my real name! My main interest at the moment is related to financial organisations, monetary policy and potential impacts of financial institutions (in the broad sense) on financial stability. In particular I am currently at Cambridge University getting engaged with some of the literature on pricing and value theory, econometrics of financial markets, monetary theories of production, international capital markets and heterodox economic theory, having chosen to take a career break and participate in a Masters of Philosophy taught by the Center of Development Studies. Within this context, I have a particular interest in the advantages and disadvantages of the process of globalization of financial systems for both developed and developing countries. As you can probably appreciate, much of what I have learnt has direct application to some of the financial crises of recent years and my hope in participating in Wikipedia is to contribute a 'pluralist' voice in the context of an apparent failure of mainstream theory to prevent or explain recent events in the global economy.
'''Patrick Shanahan:  artist-photographer'''\\n\\nPatrick Shanahan (born Manchester, England, 1955) is a British artist-photographer whose photographs investigate the contemporary cultural landscape, offering a seductive and unsettling re-imaging of modern urban environments.\\n\\nMaking full use of the scenographic, artificial aspects of large-scale photography, he produces topographic images that are close to the kinds of minimalism found in painting and sculpture. These largely unpopulated compositions are subjected to a pristine finish and treatment of light, colour and space that help to establish a tension between a real and constructed landscape - a landscape in which the distinction between reality and imagination seem to blur and we are left with a peculiar sense of spatial estrangement.\\n\\nShanahan works with a variety of medium and large-format cameras and shoots on colour negative film. The film is digitally scanned and then worked on in Photoshop. Large-scale chromogenic dye-coupler prints are produced in limited editions - see artist website for details.\\n\\nThe result is hyperreal and illusory images that transform the environs we may be used to seeing into something disturbing and strange - images that pose the artificial and natural in opposition to one another. We feel simultaneously connected to and spatially estranged from them and, in blurring the distinction between reality and imagination, his photographs alter the way we see and relate to the world.
Who invented Gunpowder? \\n\\nDuring the Tang Dynasty, around 850 A.D, an enterprising alchemist (whose name has been lost to history) mixed 75 parts saltpeter with 15 parts charcoal and 10 parts sulfur. This mixture had no discernible life-lengthening properties, but it did explode with a flash and a bang when exposed to an open flame. According to a text from that era, "smoke and flames result, so that [the alchemists'] hands and faces have been burnt, and even the whole house where they were working burned down."\\n\\nMany western history books over the years have stated that the Chinese used this discovery only for fireworks, but that is not true. Song Dynasty military forces as early as 904 A.D. used gunpowder devices against their primary enemy, the Mongols. These weapons included "flying fire" (fei huo), an arrow with a burning tube of gunpowder attached to the shaft. Flying fire arrows were miniature rockets, which propelled themselves into enemy ranks and inspired terror among both men and horses. It must have seemed like fearsome magic to the first warriors who were confronted with the power of gunpowder.
'''International trade and water''' is the relationship between international trade and the water being used by humans. The substantial increase in human population during the 20th century combined with rapid increases in overall global economic development has resulted in rising challenges for the future of public water management.  The developing world has been particularly impacted by the lack of access to clean water. Each year, millions of people die due to illnesses, diseases, and lack the capital to create the infrastructure necessary to combat the problem.<ref>(Segerfeldt 2005)</ref> These conditions have increased the global demand for clean water and in turn, have pressured free market economists to suggest that wealthy market players are the most efficient solution to addressing water issues.<ref>(Saefong 2006)</ref> Several nations can benefit from international trade in water. Particularly nations with excess fresh water and abundant capital are looking forward to making healthy profits from either the export of water to other nations, or are interested in the investment returns they will earn from participation in foreign markets. However, not everyone agrees that market forces are best capable of solving water issues. NGOs, human rights organizations, and various stakeholders oppose viewing water in economic terms. These individuals accuse international trade agreements and international economic institutions including the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) of attempting to privatize a resource that they consider a basic human right.<ref>(Overbeke 2004)</ref>  The lack of a common understanding of whether or not water should be viewed as a commodity or a basic human right has resulted in heated debates among legal professionals and leading members of the academia.\\n\\n==Water as a commodity==\\nPrior to the industrial period, water had been extracted by whichever local community lived around it. As the industrial period progressed however, this view began to be replaced by a more economic oriented approach. Today, most water goes through a complicated industrial process that begins with its extraction and ends in a complicated process involving pipes, dams, and other sorts of unnatural facilities. Even fresh water that is located in rivers and lakes must somehow be extracted.  In general these considerations involve the use of land, labor and capital thereby replacing the notion of a common resource into a value based product. [[Desalination]] and desalination plants also play a major role.\\n\\n==International institutions, international trade agreements and [[water privatization]]==\\nIn 2000, out of the 40 IMF loans distributed 12 had requirements of partial or full privatization of water supplies.iv Likewise 50 percent of World Bank loans issued in 2002 to developing countries contained a clause that requested privatization of water services.<ref>(Public Citizen.org 2002)</ref> In addition to international institutions pushing for privatization, trade agreements in the 20th century have also created the legal framework for allowing the sale of water. The GATS, known as the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]], operates on a list in approach, meaning it allows privatization in areas that the nation has agreed to open to other members. The [[Doha Development Round]] of negotiations aims at changing this stature. During these negotiations it was declared that no sector is to be excluded from the negotiations to the new agreement. If water services negotiations succeed then once a member chooses to open their markets to their own private sector, then will have to afford other members the same rights to invest in that sector.<ref>(Mann 2006)</ref> Many regional trade agreements do not have a list in approach and are therefore subject to the same conditions mentioned above. For example, in the US-CAFTA agreement only Costa Rica directly specified that water services were to be excluded from foreign investment the other nations made no similar request.<ref>(Mann 2006)</ref>  Due to the mixed results obtained from privatization of water services and the difficulty of reversing that decision, several actors have strongly opposed the export of bulk fresh water. These actors claim that once such an action is allowed to occur then it will establish a precedent of treating water just like any other export. This in turn will become legally binding and irreversible.\\n\\n==International trade and water legal disputes and politics==\\nCanada is one of the largest owners of fresh water and has for years been engaged in a legal dispute over its possession of the resource. In 1990 an American company named Sunbelt was invited by the government of British Columbia to invest in a water exporting operation. Due to setbacks, the contract never matured and Sunbelt sued the government of British Columbia for failing to meet its obligations. After years of battle the Canadian government declared in 1999 that water in its fresh state as those found in rivers and lakes contains no economic value, and is therefore outside the obligations of its trade agreement.<ref>(Dr. Isabel Al-Assar 2008)</ref> In addition, the government cited article XI of GATT (G). This article allows for the conservation of a natural resource as long as the action taken by the government is done in a non-discriminatory manner. Sunbelt however, disagreed with the applicability of this clause and claimed that Canada’s actions are in direct violation of several international trade agreements. Particularly, Sunbelt addressed Article XI of GATT which forbids a member nation from imposing measures other than taxes, levies and other charges on the export of its good. Likewise, Sunbelt argued that the water located in British Columbia belonged to US companies just as much as it belongs to Canadian companies. This argument is based on Article 11 of NAFTA known as the investment chapter. Once water is extracted from its natural state for whatever reason that same right must be given to foreign investors. Sunbelt argues that Canadian companies had such extractions in the past and therefore opened the door for foreign investors to come in and do likewise.\\n\\n==Turkey-Israel==\\nIn 2002, Israel agreed to buy 1.75 billion cubic feet of water from Turkey every year for a period of 20 years.<ref>(US Water News Online 2004)</ref> The method of transport involved the use of [[Spragg Bag|large plastic bubbles]] that would bring the water to the storage facility. In regards to the talks, the foreign minister of Turkey declared that  this agreement will increase the cooperation between the two countries and also lead to peace and stability in the Middle East.<ref>(US Water News Online 2004)</ref> Economically Israel concluded that the cost of importing water would be higher than choosing the desalinization option but chose to import anyway. In addition to hoping to achieve peace the foreign minister  also mentioned that the landmark agreement turns water into an internationally accepted ''commodity,'' and that Turkey hopes to sell water to other countries. Turkey canceled the deal after the Gaza Flotilla Raid by IDF commandos  [[Gaza flotilla raid|Gaza Flotilla Raid]] on May 31 2010. During this incident several Turkish nationals were killed by Israeli armed forces.<ref>[http://www.uswaternews.com/archives/arcglobal/4israsign3.html Israel signs agreement to buy water from Turkey]</ref>\\n\\n==UN declaration==\\nIn July 2010, the [[UN General Assembly]] declared that [[human right to water and sanitation|access to clean water and sanitation]] is a human right. The assembly did not specify whether a public authority or the private sector would be best capable of providing this right.\\n\\n==See also==\\n* [[Gaza blockade]]\\n* [[Shared vision planning]]\\n* [[Spragg Bag]]\\n* [[Water law]]\\n* [[Water privatization]]\\n* [[Water trading]]\\n* [[World Water Monitoring Day]]\\n\\n==Notes==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==References==\\ni (Segerfeldt 2005) \\n\\nii (Saefong 2006) \\n\\niii (Overbeke 2004) \\n\\niv (Shiva 2002) \\n\\nv (Public Citizen.org 2002) \\n\\nvi (Mann 2006) \\n\\nvii (Mann 2006) \\n\\nviii (Dr. Isabel Al-Assar 2008) \\n\\nix (US Water News Online 2004) \\n\\nx (US Water News Online 2004)\\n\\n[[Category:Hydrology]]\\n[[Category:Food politics]]\\n[[Category:Drinking water]]\\n[[Category:Water supply]]\\n[[Category:Water management]]\\n[[Category:Drinking water regulation]]\\n[[Category:Water management authorities]]\\n[[Category:Hydraulic engineering]]\\n[[Category:Water and politics]]\\n[[Category:Water conservation]]\\n[[Category:Environmental engineering]]\\n[[Category:Water resources management]]\\n[[Category:Water privatization]]
'''\\n== [['''''Christopher Columbus sighted the island of Jamaica during his second voyage, and it became a Spanish colony in 1509. Saint Jago de la Vega (now Spanish Town) was founded about 1523. Colonization was slow under Spanish rule. \\nJamaica was captured by an English naval force under Sir William Penn in 1655. The island was formally transferred to England in 1670. During the final decades of the 17th century, growing numbers of English immigrants arrived; the sugar, cacao, and other agricultural and forest industries were rapidly expanded; and the consequent demand for plantation labor led to large-scale importation of black slaves. Jamaica soon became one of the principal slave-trading centers in the world. But, by 1838, slavery was abolished by parliamentary legislation, and $30 million was granted as compensation to the owners of the nearly 310,000 liberated slaves.\\n\\n\\nLarge numbers of the freed blacks abandoned the plantations following emancipation and took possession of unoccupied lands in the interior, gravely disrupting the economy. Labor shortages, bankrupt plantations, and declining trade resulted in a protracted economic crisis. Oppressive taxation, discriminatory acts by the courts, and land-exclusion measures ultimately caused widespread unrest among the black population.''''']] =='''

{{User:Kpalion/Polish cuisine sidebox}}\\n\\nThe '''history of [[Polish cuisine]]''' has been shaped by such factors as the country's climate, a mostly agrarian lifestyle with parallel strains of rustic and luxurious culinary tradition, religious dietary requirements of the Catholic Church, external influences coming from various directions, as well as periods of scarcity and culinary monotony, notably during the Second World and Cold Wars. \\n\\nDue to Poland's location in a moderate temperate climate with frosty winters and a relatively short growing season, storage of food for several colder months, when fresh produce becomes largely unavailable, is a necessity. Before the advent of modern preservation techniques, such pasteurization and refrigeration, Poles relied on such traditional methods as salting-curing, pickling by lactic fermentation or acidification in vinegar, as well as smoking and drying. As a result, salty, sour and smoky flavors are typical of many Polish foods. Traditional Polish cooking is highly seasonal. ''Add examples of foods availably only during certain seasons.''\\n\\nThe official adoption of Western-rite Christianity in the 10th century CE meant that the natural seasonality has been compounded with the Roman Catholic liturgical calendar of alternating festive and fasting periods. Polish people still associate certain foods with specific religious holidays, such as Easter and Christmas. Many Poles fast every Friday, the day of the week associated with the crucifixion of Jesus, by refraining from eating land-animal meat and opting for fish instead.\\n\\nThroughout most of Poland's history, it was a predominantly agricultural country with a large portion of the population living off the fields and pastures which they tended themselves. An agrarian lifestyle with an emphasis on self-sufficience has played an important role in the shaping of Polish cuisine. Food production has always been supplemented with foraging and hunting in forests, enriching\\nthe Polish table with a variety of berries, mushrooms and game. An income gap, which grew in the early modern period between the peasants and petty nobility on the one hand and affluent grain-exporting magnates on the other, led to two separate strains in Polish culinary history – a simple rustic fare dominated by groats and flour-based foods, cabbage and root vegetables, as well as animal fats as a substitute for meat, versus lordly cuisine featuring choice meats, expensive sugar and exotic spices. The latter was played down under the Communist regime, but has been making a comeback in the 21st century and Polish cuisine draws from both currents today.\\n\\n* foreign influence: English, French, Italian, German, Czech, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Russian, Tatar, Jewish, Armenian, Turkish, etc.\\n* periods of scarcity: importance of culinary creativity\\n\\n{{TOC limit|3}}\\n\\n== Middle Ages ==\\n{{See also|Medieval cuisine|Regional cuisines of medieval Europe}}\\n[[File:Ur-painting.jpg|thumb|Copy of a 16th-century painting of an aurochs]]\\nInformation about Polish medieval cuisine is scant. No recipes from that period have been preserved, leaving historians to speculate on the subject of Polish medieval menus from archeological finds and such surviving documents as purchase orders for the royal pantry, compounded with analogies from other nations and more recent ethnographic sources.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|p=59}}{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=2–3}} In the [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|early centuries of Polish statehood]], i.e., roughly 10th–13th centuries, there was little differentation in terms of food consumption across social strata, as both poorer and wealthier families produced their own food. Subsistence farming was largely complemented with hunting, fishing, and foraging.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|pp=56–58}} \\n\\n[[Millet]] – originally [[foxtail millet]], but later replaced by [[proso millet]], better suited to the Polish climate – was the principal crop, typically consumed in the form of gruel or porridge and possibly flat breads.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|p=55}}{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=103–105}} Polish gardens provided various kinds of cabbage and [[kale]], legumes – such as [[flat bean]]s and [[lentil]]s – and root vegetables.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|p=55}}{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=125}} Peas and cabbage – fresh or pickled – were consumed all year round by all levels of the society.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=123–124}} Root vegetables included parsnips, [[Sium sisarum|skirrets]], carrots – then larger, whiter and more similar to the former – as well as beets, rutabagas, radishes, and turnips. The wife of [[Piast the Wheelwright]], a legendary peasant progenitor of Poland's first royal dynasty, was called [[Rzepicha|Rzepka]], or "Turnip", illustrating the vegetable's importance to early Poles of any station.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=126–129}} Some of the vegetables popularly consumed in this period – such as [[Fallopia convolvulus|black bindweed]],{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=11}} [[alexanders]], [[Chenopodium album|goosefoot]], [[Rumex scutatus|buckler sorrel]], and [[Lapsana|nipplewort]] – gradually disappeared from noble and then from peasant tables in later times. The [[Heracleum mantegazzianum|giant hogweed]], known in Polish as ''barszcz'', was used to make a soup to which it lent its name.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=126–129}} Additionally, apples, pears, plums, sweet and sour cherries, and hazelnuts were grown in the orchards.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=132}} \\n\\nAll social groups consumed fairly large amounts of meat, mostly pork. Pigs, resembling small wild boars, were grazed in oak and beech forests.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|p=56}} Cattle was raised mostly for draft and milk, so beef was a more expensive treat. Both of these kinds of meat, as well as poultry, were usually spit-roasted, but also stewed, boiled, barbecued or pickled in their own jelly.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=83–94}} The immense forests, which then covered most of the country, were a source of game, which served as an important addition to the meat of domestic animals. Poles commonly hunted the small game, such as hares, [[beaver]]s, [[badger]]s, [[Grey Partridge|partridges]], and [[black grouse]], and occasionally the big game, from [[roe deer]] to [[red deer]], elk ([[moose]]), wild boars, bears, [[European bison|wisent]], to [[aurochs]], the now-extinct ancestor of domestic cattle.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=84–85, 94–96}}\\n\\n* Seasonality, pickled vegetables, salted meat, ''rosół''\\n* [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church]].

Wyken Seagrave is passionate about using the history of the Universe to integrate a wide range of scientific, historical and social knowledge into a single unified story.\\n\\n“In a world facing many global problems, everyone can gain by understanding basic science, knowing where we came from and understanding the options facing us,” he says.\\n\\nWyken has been studying and writing about this subject for 40 years, both as an historical narrative and as fiction. His first book, Global Vision, was published in 1992 by Penny Press, a company dedicated to publishing on this subject, under the name Philip Brown. He converted the book to a website in 1998, and www.historyoftheuniverse.com now gets around 1 million visitors each year.\\n\\n“Seeing ourselves in a universal context is a salutary experience, giving us a new perspective on our current problems, many of which are on a global scale. To solve them will require global solutions. We all need to make important decisions about our ways of life. We need to understand what caused our problems and what options we have for solving them. We can only obtain this by taking a global perspective,” Wyken claims.\\n\\nHe began to write the story as a work of fiction in 2002, and published The Cosmic Monopole in 2011. This is the first volume of a sci-fi fantasy romance which will take the readers on a trip back through time to the Big Bang (and beyond) on an effort to save the Universe.

\\nSemantic Web:\\n\\nToday we are living in the information age and society can be labeled as information society. Knowledge, a predominant element, pervades and dominates in the day-to-day activities in information society.  There is Emergence of internet and the development in ICT (Information Communications Technology), which affects every aspect of human life. Present rapid development in communication system and recent innovation in technology witnessed as changing emphasis in the role of information and management. The end users approach to meeting information needs is also rapidly getting transformed.  The new technologies have facilitated the transformation of data into digital formats. The availability and use of digital libraries is gradually becoming the norm for the provision of literature and information in all the fields and research. Digital Libraries are catering to information services interacting with online databases of journals and other resources Digital Library are important in creating, indexing and retrieving the various forms of digital resources.
== McJondalds ==\\n\\n\\n'''McJondalds''' is a sexually transmitted disease that usually begins by affecting use of the right side of women and the left side of men. \\n\\n\\n\\n== Stages ==\\nThere are several different stages of this disease, the first being crying or laughing uncontrollably, and repeated self-urination. The secondary stage includes a severe increase in appetite, irritability, and excessive exhaustion. The third and fatal stage occurs when the individual begins to consume large quantities of Iced Tea, dance uncontrollably, and be increasingly afraid of dark basements in their Grandmother's houses.\\n\\n== Causes==\\nMcJondalds can be contracted by sleeping in a small bed next to an infected individual. The chances of contracting McJondalds increases if the infected individual's hindquarters comes in close proximity to the other individual's hindquarters.\\nOther ways to contract McJondalds include: separation from a loved one for long periods of time, reversing day and night (staying up late/sleeping in late), consuming large amounts of frozen treats, spending large amounts of time on the internet and spying on family members.\\n\\n== History ==\\nMcJondalds is among the newest of sexually transmitted diseases. Current research shows that it is most common among cousins of the same age and also among chronic tea drinkers. Very little information is able to be located, on the account that very little is known.
==National Take Back Initiative==\\n\\nThe annual National Take Back Initiative in the United States occurs October 29.  This program is coordinated by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA).  Drug Take Back Programs are a common and environmentally < supportive venue for avoiding the improper disposal of unused pharmaceuticals.  \\n\\nIn 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, enough pharmaceuticals were prescribed to medicate every American adult around-the-clock for one month.   Some of these prescriptions and over the counter drugs decay in the home and are highly susceptible to diversion, misuse, and abuse.  Often, more Americans currently abuse prescription drugs than the number of those using cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, and inhalants combined, according to the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Studies show that the majority of teens who abuse prescription drugs obtain them from family or friends for free, including from the home medicine cabinet.  Improper disposal methods can pose both safety and environmental hazards.\\n\\nFour days following the DEA’s first Take-Back Day on September 25, 2010, Congress approved legislation that amended the [[Controlled Substances Act]].  This action provided the DEA with the option to develop a permanent process for people to safely and conveniently dispose of their prescription drugs. After October 12,President Obama signed the Safe and Secure Drug Disposal Act of 2010, and the DEA immediately began installing regulations for a more permanent solution.\\n\\nThe DEA’s Take-Back events are also a reflection of the President's prescription drug abuse prevention strategy entitled [[Epidemic: \\nResponding to America’s Prescription Drug Abuse Crisis]] developed and promoted by the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]]. Ridding medicine cabinets of unused or expired medications in American homes is one of the four main items addressed the strategy for reducing diversion prescription drug abuse. The other action items include educating the public as well as health care providers. In turn, this system establishes prescription drug monitoring programs in all the states.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}
The goal of '''American influence operations in Russia''' is to force Russia into supporting American foreign policy interests and diminish Russia's potential to act as a geopolitical rival to the United States. The methods used include attempts to organise regime change in Russia, followed by installation of a new government that would be friendly towards the United States and support all its policies. Destroying Russia's capability to act as a geopolitical rival is the aim of the neoconservative agenda, according to which America should try to prevent to rise of future rivals "by all means necessary".\\n\\n== Support for NGOs and political parties ==\\nFunding of agenda-based NGOs and support for political parties.

The season for BBQ’s is just around the corner and as expected, there has been an increase in demand for outdoor electric grills. Long gone are the days where people use to burn coal to enjoy a good BBQ. Many researches showed that burning coal to cook BBQ food is known to be quite harmful as it emits carbon gases which get stored in the food that is being cooked; seeing as we consume that food, it is known to cause a lot of problems in the human body.

'''Mobile Adhoc Network: Routing Protocols \\nMANET'''\\n\\nAn ad hoc network is a collection of mobile nodes using wireless network interfaces to communicate among themselves without using the existing network infrastructure or centralized administration. In the areas where there is little or no infrastructure is available or the existing wireless infrastructure is expensive and inconvenient to use, Mobile Ad hoc Networks, called MANETs, are becoming useful. A mobile ad hoc network is a set of mobile nodes able to communicate with other nodes in their surroundings. These wireless communications happen in a peer-to-peer manner instead of static(fixed) network infrastructure, dynamically forming a temporary network to exchange information without using any pre-existing fixed network infrastructure. They are going to become integral part of next generation mobile services. A MANET consists of mobile platforms (e.g., a router with multiple hosts and wireless communications devices) herein simply referred to as "nodes", which are free to move about randomly. The nodes may be located in or on airplanes, ships, trucks, cars, perhaps even on very small devices, and there may be multiple hosts per router. The network topology in a MANET usually changes with time thus nodes are free to move arbitrarily.
== Motobolosm ==\\n\\nAn autoimmune disorder affecting African tribesmen. The total number of affected men is undetermined due to poor data gathering in the third world. It is theorized that the disease originates as a liver enzyme deficiency but and in turn results in the immune system attacking vital bodily systems such as the liver, pancreas, lungs/respiratory and some suspect it may also be responsible for heart failures. The disease only affects men in third world countries and seems to be only life threatening in those with the darkest of skins. The blackest of the blackies.
== Rape Trees ==\\n\\n\\n\\nOver the past several decades, crimes against women and children, crossing the U.S mexican border have risen.   It is estimated that the Border Patrol receives reports on about three to four rapes a day of illegal immigrants along the 2,000-mile border- or 1,040 to 1,460 a year” (TAASA; June 5, 2006) These women pay men, called "coyotes", to transport them into the United States with promises of jobs and security once they cross the border.  In an horrifying turn of events,the perpatrators are documenting their crimes by creating 'rape trees'.   ‘Rape trees’ are used as trophies,visual reminders that let other criminals know how many women were raped at the site. They hang their underwear on trees along the border as a symbol of power over the helpless immigrants.The practice first started along the border and now occurs in the Unided States.  California, Texas and Arizona,for example, are three states where ‘rape trees’ are appearing. Many of these victims remain unknown and are never given the life they were promised.\\n\\nTo view our blog, click on the link below:\\n\\n[http://www.PreventRapeTrees.Blogspot.com]
'''Aphthoviruses'''\\n\\nFoot-and-mouth disease (FMD), sometimes called hoof-and-mouth disease, is a highly contagious viral disease of cattle and pigs.  It can also infect deer, goats, sheep, and other animals with cloven hooves, as well as elephants, rats, and hedgehogs.  Horses are not susceptible to FMD.  The cause of FMD was first shown to be viral in 1897 by Friedrich Loeffler.  He passed the blood of an infected animal through a fine porcelain-glass filter and found that the fluid that was collected could still cause the disease in healthy animals.  FMD occurs throughout much of the world, including parts of Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America.  While currently (July 2001) some countries, including Canada, the United States, and Australia, have been relatively free of FMD for some time, its wide host range and rapid spread represent cause for international concern.\\n\\nIn cattle, foot-and-mouth disease is characterized by high fever that declines rapidly after two or three days; blisters inside the mouth that lead to excessive secretion of stringy or foamy saliva and to drooling; and blisters on the feet that may rupture and cause lameness.  Adult animals may suffer weight loss from which they do not recover for several months, and in cows, milk production can decline significantly.  Though most animals eventually recover from FMD, the disease can lead to ''myocarditis'' (inflammation of the heart muscle) and death, especially in newborn animals.  Some infected animals remain asymptomatic, that is, they do not suffer from or show signs of the disease; but they are ''carriers'' of FMD and can transmit it to others.\\n\\nInfection with foot-and-mouth disease tends to occur locally, that is, the virus is passed on to susceptible animals through direct contact with infected animals or with contaminated pens or vehicles used to transport livestock.  The clothes and skin of animal handlers such as farmers, standing water, and uncooked food scraps and feed supplements containing infected animal products can harbor the virus as well.  Cows can also catch FMD from the semen of infected bulls.  Control measures include quarantine and destruction of infected livestock, and export bans for meat and other animal products to countries not infected with the disease.\\n\\nFoot-and-mouth disease is caused by an ''Aphthovirus'' [ap-thoh"-vei'-r&s]  of the viral family ''Picornaviridae''. [pi-kawr'-n&-vir"-id-ei]  The members of this family are small (25-30 nm), nonenveloped icosahedral [ei-koh<nowiki>''</nowiki>-s&-hee'-dr&l]  viruses that contain single-stranded ''RNA'' (''ribonucleid acid'', the viral genetic material).  When such a virus comes in contact with a host cell, it binds to a receptor site and triggers a folding-in of the cell membrane.  Once the virus is inside the host cell, its protein coat dissolves.  New viral RNA and components of the protein coat are then synthesized in large quantities and assembled to form new viruses.  After assembly, the host cell ''lyses'' (bursts) and releases the new viruses.\\n\\nHumans can be infected with foot-and-mouth disease through contact with infected animals, but this is extremely rare.  Because the virus that causes FMD is sensitive to stomach acid, it cannot spread to humans via consumption of infected meat.  In the UK, the last confirmed human case occurred in 1967, and only a few other cases have been recorded in countries of continental Europe, Africa, and South America.  Symptoms of FMD in humans include malaise, fever, vomiting, red ulcerative lesions (surface-eroding damaged spots) of the oral tissues, and sometimes vesicular lesions (small blisters) of the skin.  There is another viral disease with similar symptoms, commonly referred to as “hand, foot, and mouth disease,” that occurs more frequently in humans, especially in young children; this disease is caused by a different virus of the family Picornaviridae, namely, an ''Enterovirus'' called ''Coxsackie A''.  Because FMD rarely infects humans but spreads rapidly among animals, it is a much greater threat to the agriculture industry than to human health.  Farmers around the world can lose billions of dollars a year during a foot-and-mouth epidemic, when large numbers of animals are destroyed and revenues from milk and meat production go down. \\n\\n=== For Further Reading ===\\nLevy, Jay A., Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat, and Robert A.

The Taiwan music and art scene has been flourishing in recent years. The influx of foreign artists to the country have given rise to a diverse culture of Taiwanese and non Taiwanese alike working together. This cohesion has made Taiwan a breeding ground for new, diverse, cutting edge, art and music. With the reach of the internet, art and music lovers from almost any country can now appreciate the talent emerging from this small Pacific Island nation.\\nTaiwan has it's share of political strife. And reflected in trials and tribulations of any society comes music, art and literature.\\n\\nMilitant Hippi, a musical band of artists that hail from different parts of the globe, has burst on the Taiwan culture scene. With them they have brought music, video art and political messages for the masses.\\n\\nThe Militant Hippi agenda is to keep the masses aware though music, art, humor and literature. Their music is a blended fusion of reggae, hip hop, classical, jazz and good ol' rock N roll.
Trait theory is a major approach to the study of human personality. Trait theorists are primarily interested in the measurement of traits, which can be defined as habitual patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion.[1] According to this perspective, traits are relatively stable over time, differ among individuals (e.g. some people are outgoing whereas others are shy), and influence behavior.\\n\\nGordon Allport was an early pioneer in the study of traits, which he sometimes referred to as dispositions. In his approach, central traits are basic to an individual's personality, whereas secondary traits are more peripheral. Common traits are those recognized within a culture and may vary between cultures. Cardinal traits are those by which an individual may be strongly recognized. Since Allport's time, trait theorists have focused more on group statistics than on single individuals. Allport called these two emphases "nomothetic" and "idiographic," respectively.\\n\\nThere is a nearly unlimited number of potential traits that could be used to describe personality. The statistical technique of factor analysis, however, has demonstrated that particular clusters of traits reliably correlate together. Hans Eysenck has suggested that personality is reducible to three major traits.[2] [3] Other researchers argue that more factors are needed to adequately describe human personality.[4] Many psychologists currently believe that five factors are sufficient.[5] [6]\\n\\nVirtually all trait models, and even ancient Greek philosophy, include extraversion vs. introversion as a central dimension of human personality. Another prominent trait that is found in nearly all models is Neuroticism, or emotional instability.
9. The three major rock families are listed and described in the following. Igneous rock is formed by the cooling and consolidation of magma. Sedimentary rock is formed either by chemical precipitation of material carried in solution in sea, lake, or river water, or by the disposition of mineral particles transported in suspension by water, wind, or ice. Metamorphic rock is either igneous or sedimentary rock that has been changed as a result of high temperatures, high pressures, or both.\\n\\n12. Regolith is when rock is exposed at Earth's surface, it is susceptible to alteration by the action of water, wind, and other agents that may act to alter the composition of the minerals present or to break the rock apart. Three types are as followed. The surface blanket is the broken-up material that constitutes the regolith; forms a blanketing lair draped over most of Earth's surface. Sediment is a type on which the unconsolidated rock and mineral particles that constitute the regolith are collectively referred to as sediment. Soil is the last type that is a special type of regolith, which contains the organic matter mixed with the mineral component. \\n\\n14. Soil is derived from the decay of dead plants and animals. Living plants are nourished by the nutrients released from decaying organisms, as well as by the nutrients released during weathering. \\n\\npg. 218\\n\\n1. The rock cycle involves the cycling of material through the geosphere as a result of the formation, breakdown, rearrangement, and reformation of rock. The rock cycle comprises the processes whereby materials within and on top of the Earth's crust are weathered, transported, deposited, deformed, altered, melted. and reformed into new rock. \\n\\n3.
{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n"Sahel Calling" is a documentary film about the role of musicians in the humanitarian crisis in Mali and the Sahel. It is not just a film, but also a communication tool to raise awareness and encourage action to re-unite Mali, to stop the violation of human rights in the north of Mali, and to demand comprehensive relief aide for people affected by the rebel insurgences and the food and water shortage in the Sahel. Appealing to a global audience to stand in solidarity with these musicians and their messages, the film also emphasizes the urgent need for North and West Africans to come together to bring peace and unity in Mali and throughout the Sahel.\\n\\nSynopsis:\\nOften in Africa, musicians say what the politicans will not, and what the oppressed cannot. Whether international celebrities or local stars, the North and West African musicians of "Sahel Calling" tell us the story of strife and struggle in Mali and the Sahel. Of course, each musician has their own story, each rhythm its own history. The film honors this as it accompanies these musicians on a musical caravan through Mauritania, Mali and Burkina Faso.\\n\\nThe caravan is part of worldwide "Festival in Exile" which pays tribute to the Festival au Désert, a musical and cultural festival usually taking place in the north of Mali, now occupied by fundamentalist Islamic groups who ban the very creation and enjoyment of music. "Sahel Calling" questions the power of musicians in this time of humanitarian crisis, especially in light of the political, social, ethnic and religious complexities of Mali and the Sahel.
'''Reinstate the article''' The proggies/warez era had a huge impact on the AOL customer base in the early-to-late 1990s and was composed of thousands of people. It's also significant as one of the earliest manifestations of organized, automated software piracy, a precursor to the BitTorrents and P2P networks of today. There was no media coverage because the "public" internet was in its infancy, the media did not fully understand it, and even AOL didn't realize the scope of the problem on its hands. (Evidenced by the years-long effort to shut the scene down, glacial by today's standards and security practices.) When you consider the media's lack of fluency in internet matters even today, it becomes clear why there are no "official sources." But harping on the fact that there was no media coverage does nothing to deny the basic fact that this era (and scene) did exist and was highly significant for thousands of users of the most popular ISP of the 1990s. Lastly, it seems odd that an editor would be so dead-set on deleting the only article on Wikipedia on this particular subject.
CYBER LAW & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\\nSuccess in any field of human activity leads to crime that needs mechanisms to control it.\\nLegal provisions should provide assurance to users, empowerment to law enforcement\\nagencies and deterrence to criminals. The law is as stringent as its enforcement. Crime is no\\nlonger limited to space, time or a group of people. Cyber space creates moral, civil and\\ncriminal wrongs. It has now given a new way to express criminal tendencies. Back in 1990,\\nless than 100,000 people were able to log on to the Internet worldwide. Now around 500\\nmillion people are hooked up to surf the net around the globe.\\nUntil recently, many information technology (IT) professionals lacked awareness of and\\ninterest in the cyber crime phenomenon. In many cases, law enforcement officers have\\nlacked the tools needed to tackle the problem; old laws didn’t quite fit the crimes being\\ncommitted, new laws hadn’t quite caught up to the reality of what was happening, and there\\nwere few court precedents to look to for guidance. Furthermore, debates over privacy issues\\nhampered the ability of enforcement agents to gather the evidence needed to prosecute these\\nnew cases. Finally, there was a certain amount of antipathy—or at the least, distrust—\\nbetween the two most important players in any effective fight against cyber crime: law\\nenforcement agencies and computer professionals. Yet close cooperation between the two\\nis crucial if we are to control the cyber crime problem and make the Internet a safe “place”\\nfor its users.\\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law|Law]] enforcement personnel understand the criminal mindset and know the basics of\\ngathering evidence and bringing offenders to justice. IT personnel understand computers\\nand networks, how they work, and how to track down information on them. Each has half of\\nthe key to defeating the cyber criminal.\\nIT professionals need good definitions of cybercrime in order to know when (and what) to\\nreport to police, but law enforcement agencies must have statutory definitions of specific\\ncrimes in order to charge a criminal with an offense. The first step in specifically defining\\nindividual cybercrimes is to sort all the acts that can be considered cybercrimes into\\norganized categories.United Nations’ Definition of Cybercrime\\nCybercrime spans not only state but national boundaries as well. Perhaps we should look to\\ninternational organizations to provide a standard definition of the crime. At the Tenth\\nUnited Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of Offenders, in a\\nworkshop devoted to the issues of crimes related to computer networks, cybercrime was\\nbroken into two categories and defined thus:\\na. Cybercrime in a narrow sense (computer crime): Any illegal behavior directed by means\\nof electronic operations that targets the security of computer systems and the data processed\\nby them.\\nb. Cybercrime in a broader sense (computer-related crime): Any illegal behavior committed\\nby means of, or in relation to, a computer system or network, including such crimes as\\nillegal possession [and] offering or distributing information by means of a computer system\\nor network.\\nOf course, these definitions are complicated by the fact that an act may be illegal in one\\nnation but not in another.\\nThere are more concrete examples, including\\ni. Unauthorized access\\nii Damage to computer data or programs\\niii Computer sabotage\\niv Unauthorized interception of communications\\nv Computer espionage\\nThese definitions, although not completely definitive, do give us a good starting point—one\\nthat has some international recognition and agreement—for determining just what we mean\\nby the term cybercrime.\\nIn Indian law, cyber crime has to be voluntary and willful, an act or omission that adversely\\naffects a person or property. The IT Act provides the backbone for e-commerce and India’s\\napproach has been to look at e-governance and e-commerce primarily from the promotional\\naspects looking at the vast opportunities and the need to sensitize the population to the\\n2possibilities of the information age. There is the need to take in to consideration the security\\naspects.\\nIn the present global situation where cyber control mechanisms are important we need to\\npush cyber laws. Cyber Crimes are a new class of crimes to India rapidly expanding due to\\nextensive use of internet. Getting the right lead and making the right interpretation are very\\nimportant in solving a cyber crime. The 7 stage continuum of a criminal case starts from\\nperpetration to registration to reporting, investigation, prosecution, adjudication and\\nexecution. The system can not be stronger than the weakest link in the chain. In India, there\\nare 30 million policemen to train apart from 12,000 strong Judiciary. Police in India are\\ntrying to become cyber crime savvy and hiring people who are trained in the area. Each\\npolice station in Delhi will have a computer soon which will be connected to the Head\\nQuarter.. The pace of the investigations however can be faster; judicial sensitivity and\\nknowledge need to improve. Focus needs to be on educating the police and district\\njudiciary. IT Institutions can also play a role in this area.\\nTechnology nuances are important in a spam infested environment where privacy can be\\ncompromised and individuals can be subjected to become a victim unsuspectingly. We need\\nto sensitize our investigators and judges to the nuances of the system. Most cyber criminals\\nhave a counter part in the real world. If loss of property or persons is caused the criminal is\\npunishable under the IPC also. Since the law enforcement agencies find it is easier to handle\\nit under the IPC, IT Act cases are not getting reported and when reported are not necessarily\\ndealt with under the IT Act. A lengthy and intensive process of learning is required.\\nA whole series of initiatives of cyber forensics were undertaken and cyber law procedures\\nresulted out of it. This is an area where learning takes place every day as we are all\\nbeginners in this area. We are looking for solutions faster than the problems can get\\ninvented. We need to move faster than the criminals.\\nThe real issue is how to prevent cyber crime. For this, there is need to raise the probability\\nof apprehension and conviction. India has a law on evidence that considers admissibility,\\nauthenticity, accuracy, and completeness to convince the judiciary. The challenge in cyber\\ncrime cases includes getting evidence that will stand scrutiny in a foreign court.\\n3For this India needs total international cooperation with specialised agencies of different\\ncountries. Police has to ensure that they have seized exactly what was there at the scene of\\ncrime, is the same that has been analysed and the report presented in court is based on this\\nevidence. It has to maintain the chain of custody. The threat is not from the intelligence of\\ncriminals but from our ignorance and the will to fight it. The law is stricter now on\\nproducing evidence especially where electronic documents are concerned.\\nThe computer is the target and the tool for the perpetration of crime. It is used for the\\ncommunication of the criminal activity such as the injection of a virus/worm which can\\ncrash entire networks. \\nThe [[Information_Technology_Act,_2000|Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000]], specifies the acts which have been made\\npunishable. Since the primary objective of this Act is to create an enabling environment for\\ncommercial use of I.T., certain omissions and commissions of criminals while using\\ncomputers have not been included. With the legal recognition of Electronic Records and the\\namendments made in the several sections of the IPC vide the IT Act, 2000, several offences\\nhaving bearing on cyber-arena are also registered under the appropriate sections of the IPC.\\nDuring the year 2003, 60 cases were registered under IT Act as compared to 70 cases during\\nthe previous year thereby reporting a decline of 14.3 percent in 2003 over 2002. Of the total\\n60 cases registered under IT Act 2000, around 33 percent (20 cases) relate to Obscene\\nPublication / Transmission in electronic form, normally known as cases of cyber\\npornography. 17 persons were arrested for committing such offences during 2003.\\nThere were 21 cases of Hacking of computer systems wherein 18 persons were arrested in\\n2003. Of the total (21) Hacking cases, the cases relating to Loss/Damage of computer\\nresource/utility under Sec 66(1) of the IT Act were to the tune of 62 percent (13 cases) and\\nthat related to Hacking under Section 66(2) of IT Act were 38 percent (8cases). \\nDuring 2003, a total of 411 cases were registered under IPC Sections as compared to 738\\nsuch cases during 2002 thereby reporting a significant decline of 44 percent in 2003 over\\n2002. Andhra Pradesh reported more than half of such cases (218 out of 411) (53 percent). \\n4Of the 411 cases registered under IPC, majority of the crimes fall under 3 categories viz.\\nCriminal Breach of Trust or Fraud (269), Forgery (89) and [[Counterfeiting]] (53). \\nThough, these offences fall under the traditional IPC crimes, the cases had the cyber tones\\nwherein computer, Internet or its related aspects were present in the crime and hence they\\nwere categorised as Cyber Crimes under IPC. \\nDuring 2003, number of cases under Cyber Crimes relating to Counterfeiting of\\ncurrency/Stamps stood at 53 wherein 118 persons were arrested during 2003. Of the 47,478\\ncases reported under Cheating, the Cyber Forgery (89) accounted for 0.2 per cent. Of the\\ntotal Criminal Breach of Trust cases (13,432), the Cyber frauds (269) accounted for 2\\npercent. Of the Counterfeiting offences (2,055), Cyber Counterfeiting (53) offences\\naccounted for 2.6 percent.\\nA total of 475 persons were arrested in the country for Cyber Crimes under IPC during\\n2003. Of these, 53.6 percent offenders (255) were taken into custody for offences under\\nCriminal Breach of Trust/Fraud (Cyber) and 21.4 percent (102) for offences under ‘Cyber\\nForgery’.\\nThe age-wise profile of the arrested persons showed that 45 percent were in the age-group\\nof 30-45 years, 28.5 percent of the offenders were in the age-group of 45-60 years and 11\\noffenders were aged 60 years and above. Gujarat reported 2 offenders who were below 18\\nyears of age. \\nFraud/Illegal gain (120) accounted for 60 per cent of the total Cyber Crime motives reported\\nin the country. Greed/Money (15 cases) accounted for 7.5 percent of the Cyber Crimes\\nreported. Eve-teasing and Harassment (8 cases) accounted for around 4 per cent. Cyber\\nSuspects include Neighbours / Friends / Relatives (91), Disgrunted employees (11),\\nBusiness Competitors (9), Crackers Students / Professional learners (3). \\nCybercrime is not on the decline. The latest statistics show that cybercrime is actually on the\\nrise. However, it is true that in India, cybercrime is not reported too much about.\\nConsequently there is a false sense of complacency that cybercrime does not exist and that\\n5society is safe from cybercrime. This is not the correct picture. The fact is that people in our\\ncountry do not report cybercrimes for many reasons. Many do not want to face harassment\\nby the police. There is also the fear of bad publicity in the media, which could hurt their\\nreputation and standing in society. Also, it becomes extremely difficult to convince the\\npolice to register any cybercrime, because of lack of orientation and awareness about\\ncybercrimes and their registration and handling by the police. \\nA recent survey indicates that for every 500 cybercrime incidents that take place, only 50\\nare reported to the police and out of that only one is actually registered. These figures\\nindicate how difficult it is to convince the police to register a cybercrime. The establishment\\nof cybercrime cells in different parts of the country was expected to boost cybercrime\\nreporting and prosecution. However, these cells haven’t quite kept up with expectations.\\nNetizens should not be under the impression that cybercrime is vanishing and they must\\nrealize that with each passing day, cyberspace becomes a more dangerous place to be in,\\nwhere criminals roam freely to execute their criminals intentions encouraged by the socalled anonymity that internet provides.\\nThe absolutely poor rate of cyber crime conviction in the country has also not helped the\\ncause of regulating cybercrime. There has only been few cybercrime convictions in the\\nwhole country, which can be counted on fingers. We need to ensure that we have\\nspecialized procedures for prosecution of cybercrime cases so as to tackle them on a priority\\nbasis,. This is necessary so as to win the faith of the people in the ability of the system to\\ntackle cybercrime. We must ensure that our system provides for stringent punishment of\\ncybercrimes and cyber criminals so that the same acts as a deterrent for others. \\nThreat Perceptions\\nUK has the largest number of infected computers in the world followed by the US and\\nChina. Financial attacks are 16 events per 1000, the highest among all kinds of attacks. The\\nUS is the leading source country for attacks but this has declined. China is second and\\nGermany is third. It is hard to determine where the attack came from originally.\\nThe number of viruses and worm variants rose sharply to 7,360 that is a 64% increase over\\nthe previous reporting period and a 332% increase over the previous year. There are 17,500\\nvariants of Win.32 viruses. Threats to confidential information are on the rise with 54% of\\n6the top 50 reporting malicious code with the potential to expose such information. Phishing\\nmessages grew to 4.5 million from 1 million between July and December 2004.\\nSome Indian Case Studies\\n1. Pune Citibank MphasiS Call Center Fraud\\nUS $ 3,50,000 from accounts of four US customers were dishonestly transferred to bogus\\naccounts. This will give a lot of ammunition to those lobbying against outsourcing in US.\\nSuch cases happen all over the world but when it happens in India it is a serious matter and\\nwe can not ignore it. It is a case of sourcing engineering. Some employees gained the\\nconfidence of the customer and obtained their PIN numbers to commit fraud. They got these\\nunder the guise of helping the customers out of difficult situations. Highest security prevails\\nin the call centers in India as they know that they will lose their business. There was not as\\nmuch of breach of security but of sourcing engineering.\\nThe call center employees are checked when they go in and out so they can not copy down\\nnumbers and therefore they could not have noted these down. They must have remembered\\nthese numbers, gone out immediately to a cyber café and accessed the Citibank accounts of\\nthe customers.\\nAll accounts were opened in Pune and the customers complained that the money from their\\naccounts was transferred to Pune accounts and that’s how the criminals were traced. Police\\nhas been able to prove the honesty of the call center and has frozen the accounts where the\\nmoney was transferred.\\nThere is need for a strict background check of the call center executives. However, best of\\nbackground checks can not eliminate the bad elements from coming in and breaching\\nsecurity. We must still ensure such checks when a person is hired. There is need for a\\nnational ID and a national data base where a name can be referred to. In this case\\npreliminary investigations do not reveal that the criminals had any crime history. Customer\\neducation is very important so customers do not get taken for a ride. Most banks are guilt of\\nnot doing this. \\n2. Bazee.com case\\n7CEO of Bazee.com was arrested in December 2004 because a CD with objectionable\\nmaterial was being sold on the website. The CD was also being sold in the markets in Delhi.\\nThe Mumbai city police and the Delhi Police got into action. The CEO was later released on\\nbail. This opened up the question as to what kind of distinction do we draw between Internet\\nService Provider and Content Provider. The burden rests on the accused that he was the\\nService Provider and not the Content Provider. It also raises a lot of issues regarding how\\nthe police should handle the cyber crime cases and a lot of education is required.\\n3. State of Tamil Nadu Vs Suhas Katti \\nThe Case of Suhas Katti is notable for the fact that the conviction was achieved successfully\\nwithin a relatively quick time of 7 months from the filing of the FIR. Considering that\\nsimilar cases have been pending in other states for a much longer time, the efficient\\nhandling of the case which happened to be the first case of the Chennai Cyber Crime Cell\\ngoing to trial deserves a special mention.\\nThe case related to posting of obscene, defamatory and annoying message about a divorcee\\nwoman in the yahoo message group. E-Mails were also forwarded to the victim for\\ninformation by the accused through a false e-mail account opened by him in the name of the\\nvictim. The posting of the message resulted in annoying phone calls to the lady in the belief\\nthat she was soliciting.\\nBased on a complaint made by the victim in February 2004, the Police traced the accused to\\nMumbai and arrested him within the next few days. The accused was a known family friend\\nof the victim and was reportedly interested in marrying her. She however married another\\nperson. This marriage later ended in divorce and the accused started contacting her once\\nagain. On her reluctance to marry him, the accused took up the harassment through the\\nInternet. \\nOn 24-3-2004 Charge Sheet was filed u/s 67 of IT Act 2000, 469 and 509 IPC before The\\nHon’ble Addl. CMM Egmore by citing 18 witnesses and 34 documents and material objects.\\nThe same was taken on file in C.C.NO.4680/2004. On the prosecution side 12 witnesses\\nwere examined and entire documents were marked as Exhibits.\\n8The Defence argued that the offending mails would have been given either by ex-husband\\nof the complainant or the complainant her self to implicate the accused as accused alleged to\\nhave turned down the request of the complainant to marry her. \\nFurther the Defence counsel argued that some of the documentary evidence was not\\nsustainable under Section 65 B of the Indian Evidence Act. However, the court relied upon\\nthe expert witnesses and other evidence produced before it, including the witnesses of the\\nCyber Cafe owners and came to the conclusion that the crime was conclusively proved.\\nLd. Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, delivered the judgement on 5-11-04\\nas follows:\\n“ The accused is found guilty of offences under section 469, 509 IPC and 67 of IT Act\\n2000 and the accused is convicted and is sentenced for the offence to undergo RI for 2\\nyears under 469 IPC and to pay fine of Rs.500/-and for the offence u/s 509 IPC\\nsentenced to undergo 1 year Simple imprisonment and to pay fine of Rs.500/- and for\\nthe offence u/s 67 of IT Act 2000 to undergo RI for 2 years and to pay fine of\\nRs.4000/- All sentences to run concurrently.”\\nThe accused paid fine amount and he was lodged at Central Prison, Chennai. This is\\nconsidered as the first case convicted under section 67 of Information Technology Act 2000\\nin India. \\n4. The Bank NSP Case\\nThe Bank NSP case is the one where a management trainee of the bank was engaged to be\\nmarried. The couple exchanged many emails using the company computers. After some\\ntime the two broke up and the girl created fraudulent email ids such as\\n“indianbarassociations” and sent emails to the boy’s foreign clients. She used the banks\\ncomputer to do this. The boy’s company lost a large number of clients and took the bank to\\ncourt. The bank was held liable for the emails sent using the bank’s system.\\n5. SMC Pneumatics (India) Pvt. Ltd. v. Jogesh Kwatra\\n9In India’s first case of cyber defamation, a Court of Delhi assumed jurisdiction over a matter\\nwhere a corporate’s reputation was being defamed through emails and passed an important\\nex-parte injunction. \\nIn this case, the defendant Jogesh Kwatra being an employ of the plaintiff company started\\nsending derogatory, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, filthy and abusive emails to his employers\\nas also to different subsidiaries of the said company all over the world with the aim to\\ndefame the company and its Managing Director Mr. R K Malhotra. The plaintiff filed a suit\\nfor permanent injunction restraining the defendant from doing his illegal acts of sending\\nderogatory emails to the plaintiff.\\nOn behalf of the plaintiffs it was contended that the emails sent by the defendant were\\ndistinctly obscene, vulgar, abusive, intimidating, humiliating and defamatory in nature.\\nCounsel further argued that the aim of sending the said emails was to malign the high\\nreputation of the plaintiffs all over India and the world. He further contended that the acts of\\nthe defendant in sending the emails had resulted in invasion of legal rights of the plaintiffs.\\nFurther the defendant is under a duty not to send the aforesaid emails. It is pertinent to note\\nthat after the plaintiff company discovered the said employ could be indulging in the matter\\nof sending abusive emails, the plaintiff terminated the services of the defendant. \\nAfter hearing detailed arguments of Counsel for Plaintiff, Hon’ble Judge of the Delhi High\\nCourt passed an ex-parte ad interim injunction observing that a prima facie case had been\\nmade out by the plaintiff. Consequently, the Delhi High Court restrained the defendant from\\nsending derogatory, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, humiliating and abusive emails either to\\nthe plaintiffs or to its sister subsidiaries all over the world including their Managing\\nDirectors and their Sales and Marketing departments. Further, Hon’ble Judge also restrained\\nthe defendant from publishing, transmitting or causing to be published any information in\\nthe actual world as also in cyberspace which is derogatory or defamatory or abusive of the\\nplaintiffs.\\n10This order of Delhi High Court assumes tremendous significance as this is for the first time\\nthat an Indian Court assumes jurisdiction in a matter concerning cyber defamation and\\ngrants an ex-parte injunction restraining the defendant from defaming the plaintiffs by\\nsending derogatory, defamatory, abusive and obscene emails either to the plaintiffs or their\\nsubsidiaries.\\n6. PARLIAMENT ATTACK CASE\\nBureau of Police Research and Development at Hyderabad had handled some of the top\\ncyber cases, including analysing and retrieving information from the laptop recovered from\\nterrorist, who attacked Parliament. The laptop which was seized from the two terrorists,\\nwho were gunned down when Parliament was under siege on December 13 2001, was sent\\nto Computer Forensics Division of BPRD after computer experts at Delhi failed to trace\\nmuch out of its contents. \\nThe laptop contained several evidences that confirmed of the two terrorists’ motives,\\nnamely the sticker of the Ministry of Home that they had made on the laptop and pasted on\\ntheir ambassador car to gain entry into Parliament House and the the fake ID card that one\\nof the two terrorists was carrying with a Government of India emblem and seal.\\nThe emblems (of the three lions) were carefully scanned and the seal was also craftly made\\nalong with residential address of Jammu and Kashmir. But careful detection proved that it\\nwas all forged and made on the laptop.\\n7. Andhra Pradesh Tax Case\\nDubious tactics of a prominent businessman from Andhra Pradesh was exposed after\\nofficials of the department got hold of computers used by the accused person.\\nThe owner of a plastics firm was arrested and Rs 22 crore cash was recovered from his\\nhouse by sleuths of the Vigilance Department. They sought an explanation from him\\nregarding the unaccounted cash within 10 days.\\n11The accused person submitted 6,000 vouchers to prove the legitimacy of trade and thought\\nhis offence would go undetected but after careful scrutiny of vouchers and contents of his\\ncomputers it revealed that all of them were made after the raids were conducted. \\nIt later revealed that the accused was running five businesses under the guise of one\\ncompany and used fake and computerised vouchers to show sales records and save tax.\\n8. SONY.SAMBANDH.COM CASE\\nIndia saw its first cybercrime conviction recently. It all began after a complaint was filed by\\nSony India Private Ltd, which runs a website called www.sony-sambandh.com, targeting\\nNon Resident Indians. The website enables NRIs to send Sony products to their friends and\\nrelatives in India after they pay for it online. \\nThe company undertakes to deliver the products to the concerned recipients. In May 2002,\\nsomeone logged onto the website under the identity of Barbara Campa and ordered a Sony\\nColour Television set and a cordless head phone. \\nShe gave her credit card number for payment and requested that the products be delivered to\\nArif Azim in Noida. The payment was duly cleared by the credit card agency and the\\ntransaction processed. After following the relevant procedures of due diligence and\\nchecking, the company delivered the items to Arif Azim. \\nAt the time of delivery, the company took digital photographs showing the delivery being\\naccepted by Arif Azim.\\nThe transaction closed at that, but after one and a half months the credit card agency\\ninformed the company that this was an unauthorized transaction as the real owner had\\ndenied having made the purchase. \\nThe company lodged a complaint for online cheating at the Central Bureau of Investigation\\nwhich registered a case under Section 418, 419 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code. \\nThe matter was investigated into and Arif Azim was arrested. Investigations revealed that\\nArif Azim, while working at a call centre in Noida gained access to the credit card number\\nof an American national which he misused on the company’s site. \\n12The CBI recovered the colour television and the cordless head phone.\\nIn this matter, the CBI had evidence to prove their case and so the accused admitted his\\nguilt. The court convicted Arif Azim under Section 418, 419 and 420 of the Indian Penal\\nCode — this being the first time that a cybercrime has been convicted. \\nThe court, however, felt that as the accused was a young boy of 24 years and a first-time\\nconvict, a lenient view needed to be taken. The court therefore released the accused on\\nprobation for one year.\\nThe judgment is of immense significance for the entire nation. Besides being the first\\nconviction in a cybercrime matter, it has shown that the the Indian Penal Code can be\\neffectively applied to certain categories of cyber crimes which are not covered under the\\nInformation Technology Act 2000. Secondly, a judgment of this sort sends out a clear\\nmessage to all that the law cannot be taken for a ride. \\n9. Nasscom vs. Ajay Sood & Others\\nIn a landmark judgment in the case of National Association of Software and Service\\nCompanies vs Ajay Sood & Others, delivered in March, ‘05, the Delhi High Court declared\\n`[[phishing]]’ on the internet to be an illegal act, entailing an injunction and recovery of\\ndamages.\\nElaborating on the concept of ‘phishing’, in order to lay down a precedent in India, the court\\nstated that it is a form of internet fraud where a person pretends to be a legitimate\\nassociation, such as a bank or an insurance company in order to extract personal data from a\\ncustomer such as access codes, passwords, etc. Personal data so collected by\\nmisrepresenting the identity of the legitimate party is commonly used for the collecting\\nparty’s advantage. court also stated, by way of an example, that typical phishing scams\\ninvolve persons who pretend to represent online banks and siphon cash from e-banking\\naccounts after conning consumers into handing over confidential banking details.\\nThe Delhi HC stated that even though there is no specific legislation in India to penalise\\nphishing, it held phishing to be an illegal act by defining it under Indian law as “a\\n13misrepresentation made in the course of trade leading to confusion as to the source and\\norigin of the e-mail causing immense harm not only to the consumer but even to the person\\nwhose name, identity or password is misused.” The court held the act of phishing as passing\\noff and tarnishing the plaintiff’s image.\\nThe plaintiff in this case was the National Association of Software and Service Companies\\n(Nasscom), India’s premier software association. \\nThe defendants were operating a placement agency involved in head-hunting and\\nrecruitment. In order to obtain personal data, which they could use for purposes of headhunting, the defendants composed and sent e-mails to third parties in the name of Nasscom.\\nThe high court recognised the trademark rights of the plaintiff and passed an ex-parte adinterim injunction restraining the defendants from using the trade name or any other name\\ndeceptively similar to Nasscom. The court further restrained the defendants from holding\\nthemselves out as being associates or a part of Nasscom.\\nThe court appointed a commission to conduct a search at the defendants’ premises. Two\\nhard disks of the computers from which the fraudulent e-mails were sent by the defendants\\nto various parties were taken into custody by the local commissioner appointed by the court.\\nThe offending e-mails were then downloaded from the hard disks and presented as evidence\\nin court. \\nDuring the progress of the case, it became clear that the defendants in whose names the\\noffending e-mails were sent were fictitious identities created by an employee on defendants’\\ninstructions, to avoid recognition and legal action. On discovery of this fraudulent act, the\\nfictitious names were deleted from the array of parties as defendants in the case.\\nSubsequently, the defendants admitted their illegal acts and the parties settled the matter\\nthrough the recording of a compromise in the suit proceedings. According to the terms of\\ncompromise, the defendants agreed to pay a sum of Rs1.6 million to the plaintiff as\\ndamages for violation of the plaintiff’s trademark rights. The court also ordered the hard\\ndisks seized from the defendants’ premises to be handed over to the plaintiff who would be\\nthe owner of the hard disks. \\n14This case achieves clear milestones: It brings the act of “phishing” into the ambit of Indian\\nlaws even in the absence of specific legislation; It clears the misconception that there is no\\n“damages culture” in India for violation of IP rights; This case reaffirms IP owners’ faith in\\nthe Indian judicial system’s ability and willingness to protect intangible property rights and\\nsend a strong message to IP owners that they can do business in India without sacrificing\\ntheir IP rights.\\n10. Infinity e-Search BPO Case \\nThe Gurgaon BPO fraud has created an embarrassing situation for Infinity e-Search, the\\ncompany in which Mr Karan Bahree was employed.\\nA British newspaper had reported that one of its undercover reporters had purchased\\npersonal information of 1,000 British customers from an Indian call-center employee.\\nHowever, the employee of Infinity eSearch, a New Delhi-based web designing company,\\nwho was reportedly involved in the case has denied any wrongdoing. The company has also\\nsaid that it had nothing to do with the incident.\\nIn the instant case the journalist used an intermediary, offered a job, requested for a\\npresentation on a CD and later claimed that the CD contained some confidential data. The\\nfact that the CD contained such data is itself not substantiated by the journalist.\\nIn this sort of a situation we can only say that the journalist has used “Bribery” to induce a\\n“Out of normal behavior” of an employee. This is not observation of a fact but creating a\\nfactual incident by intervention. Investigation is still on in this matter.

To import alcoholic beverages into the United States the general rule is that one must possess both the appropriate State and Federal beverage alcohol licenses.  (Unless the distinction is important, the works "permit" and "license" will be used interchangably)  \\n\\nFor licensing, labeling and tax purposes, alcoholic beverages are catagorized as wine, malt beverage (ie:  beer, ale) or distilled spirits.\\n\\nFederal law requires that one obtain a "basic permit" to import the appropriate type of alcohol for commercial purposes.  \\n\\nFederal law and regulations also require each container of beverage alcohol be labeled with a standard health warning statement in any case where the alcohol may be sold or "distributed".  The term "distributed" is interpreted broadly and is not restricted to sales or commercial transactions.  (27 CFR Part 16.)  Note that the law and regulations provide for a civil penalty of $11,000 per violation.\\n\\nTo import alcoholic beverages without a permit, the importer must qualify for an exception to the general rule.

Media Studies\\n\\n We have all grown up in environments saturated with media experiences. The media are familiar and one of our first aims will be to make them strange - to allow you to distance yourself from something you know, in order to look at it differently. This familiarity, and the expectations it arouses, also creates problems for a Media Studies textbook. TV, from children's programs through educational TV, to the vast range of broadcast material has probably taught you a great deal, in ways which books cannot hope to emulate. You may also have quite sophisticated experience of computers, at home and at college, including interactive forms like CD-ROMS and the internet. Modern technologies have dazzling capacities. It is now possible, using digital imaging, to make it seem as though Marilyn Monroe and Brad Pitt are playing a scene together or that Earth can morph into an apple before our eyes; to broadcast such scenes and simultaneously \\nacross continents; and to accompany them with music created entirely by computer. The internet has been touted, like many earlier technologies, everything is readily available and all questions can be answered.
\\n== '''South China Learning Institute''' ==\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South China Learning Institute (SCLI) was established by an organization of American and European professionals who have lived and worked throughout China for many years. The creation of the Institute was a response to what they saw as a need for greater learning and exchange between China and other nations and the immense opportunities that China now offers. They decided to locate the Institute in Shenzhen, a city with 10 million people, in response to the dynamism and extreme growth that has defined the Pearl River Delta region for the past 20 years.\\n\\n\\nSCLI accepts participants from all backgrounds seeking a deeply productive China learning experience, be it in language or otherwise.\\n\\n\\nSCLI offers Intensive Mandarin Language courses, featuring classroom study, exchange, and a wide selection of unique cultural and educational electives. Additionally, SCLI offers programs involving internship placements with major international companies in Shenzhen.\\n\\n\\nSCLI provides all participants with lodging, travel support, and many exciting travel excursions around China. SCLI offers a variety of packages built to accommodate all levels of Mandarin skills, interests, and time frames. For lodging, students have the option to choose between a home stay program with a Chinese family, or a more communal setting with peers in downtown Shenzhen.
== '''Global Initiative for Essential and Emergency Surgical Care''' ==\\n\\n\\n\\n'''The Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care''' (GIEESC)was established by the World Health Organization in December 2005.  Its general purpose is to reduce “death and disability from road traffic accidents, trauma, burns, falls, pregnancy related complications, domestic violence, disasters and other emergency surgical conditions” by improving collaborations between relevant organizations, institutions, and agencies.  Specific objectives include improving basic medical supplies at district hospitals, as well as better training for staff to bolster medical standards and care.\\n\\n== Establishment of GIEESC ==\\nThe GIEESC is a partnership of organizations, NGO’s, institutions, and associations from third and first world countries.  This partnership will work together in creating solutions and meeting the Millennium Development Goals developed by the WHO—which include reducing maternal and child mortality rates, as well as reducing HIV rates—“through improvement in the quality and safety of clinical procedures (essential surgical and anaesthesia care).”\\n===Mission statement===\\nThe GIEESC's goals are: to improve the already existing training and education programs necessary to execute emergency and essential surgical care; to develop district hospitals’ surgical, obstetric, trauma, and anesthesia service; to train personnel with the appropriate strategies to treat patients; to continue education to maintain skills; and to develop a dependable system that facilitates access to medication and medicinal drugs.\\n===Challenges===\\nChallenges include: poor equipment to “perform simple but vital interventions such as resuscitation, the provision of oxygen, assessment of anemia, suctions, intercostal drainage and airway support,”  inadequate basic supplies, absence of specialized surgical teams and lack of anesthesia.
A general definition of an ecological crisis the occurrences when the environment of species or a population changes in a way that destabilizes its continued survival. The main cause of the ecological crisis are human induced activities or anthropocentric acts like mining, pollution, deforestations, construction etcetera, for the global economy to grow.\\nThe solutions to the contemporary ecological crisis is sustainable development. Sustainable development is a type of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, not only for anthropocentric reasons but nature holistically. The concept of sustainable will be successful when the current population stabilize for natural resources to be evenly distributed’ for developed countries like the United States not to consume products that they do not need but they can rather make it accessible to countries who need those resources. \\nThe lifestyle as humans that we all should adopt is a culture of living in an environmentally friendly way. Like reusing, afforestation, and adopting traditions that have certain laws to use the environment sufficiently. The ideas of Saint Francis should be implemented because humans tend to have an idea that they are not part of nature or rather superior than nature which is not the case. \\nThe reason why human beings cause environmental degradation is because of the capitalistic regime. Humans in the ancient stages of life lived sustainably were they were part of nature. Nowadays humans maximize the use of natural resources to maximize their profits. That is why nature is exploited, it is a tool to produce and gain a lot of profit which will impact negatively now and in future.\\nHumans now have the obligation to make amends to the natural environment. Already climatic activities have been altered because of the human induced factors now it is up to humans to be part of nature. Humans need to be ethical about the actions that they act on.

A nuclear bomb is a weapon that uses a chemical reaction to release huge amounts of energy in explosive form.{}\\n	Since nuclear weapons were created in the late 1940s, they have been the most destructive manmade weapon on earth. Most modern nuclear bombs weigh around 2400 lb. but can equal the explosive force of millions of tons of TNT.  There are currently thousands of nukes but most of them fall into one of two categories; atomic and thermonuclear. The atomic bomb uses nuclear fission to power its explosion. The thermonuclear uses nuclear fission as well as nuclear fusion to fuel a much larger explosion. Another type of nuclear bomb is the multi-stage thermonuclear bomb, which the range of the explosion is too dangerous to serve purpose or even test. Either way all nuclear weapons use uranium or plutonium to power the blast.{}\\n	The intense range and damage of the nuclear bomb is all due to how it works.  The nuclear bomb obtains this power from a process that can be accurately compared to the domino effect. The process begins when a uranium (or plutonium) atom comes in contact with a neutron; the uranium then splits in two. The two uranium atoms continue to collide with other neutron atoms and splitting over and over again. This process repeats its’ self until there is so much split uranium atoms that the bombs casing bursts. This is called the “splitting the atom” method.{}\\n	The idea of splitting the atom began in 1939 when Albert Einstein wrote a letter to president Roosevelt that the
Microwave transmission refers to the technology of transmitting information or energy by the use of radio waves whose wavelengths are conveniently measured in small numbers of centimeters; these are called microwaves. This part of the radio spectrum ranges across frequencies of roughly 1.0 gigahertz (GHz) to 30 GHz. These correspond to wavelengths from 30 centimeters down to 1.0 cm.\\nMicrowaves are widely used for point-to-point communications because their small wavelength allows conveniently-sized antennas to direct them in narrow beams, which can be pointed directly at the receiving antenna. This allows nearby microwave equipment to use the same frequencies without interfering with each other, as lower frequency radio waves do. Another advantage is that the high frequency of microwaves gives the microwave band a very large information-carrying capacity; the microwave band has a bandwidth 30 times that of all the rest of the radio spectrum below it. A disadvantage is that microwaves are limited to line of sight propagation; they cannot pass around hills or mountains as lower frequency radio waves can.\\nMicrowave radio transmission is commonly used in point-to-point communication systems on the surface of the Earth, in satellite communications, and in deep space radio communications. Other parts of the microwave radio band are used for radars, radio navigation systems, sensor systems, and radio astronomy.\\nThe next higher part of the radio electromagnetic spectrum, where the frequencies are above 30 GHz and below 100 GHz, are called "millimeter waves" because their wavelengths are conveniently measured in millimeters, and their wavelengths range from 10 mm down to 3.0 mm. Radio waves in this band are usually strongly attenuated by the Earthly atmosphere and particles contained in it, especially during wet weather. Also, in wide band of frequencies around 60 GHz, the radio waves are strongly attenuated by molecular oxygen in the atmosphere. The electronic technologies needed in the millimeter wave band are also much more difficult to utilize than those of the microwave band.
Deficitis\\n\\n  Deficitis is a devastating disease where an organ eating parasite called Numotoma eats away at the internal organs until the host dies. The first warning sign of Deficitis is coughing. An infected individual may also suffer from vomiting, diarrhea, uncontrollable bowels, and in the worst cases neck spasms. It is mainly contracted from the common house cat. In order to avoid this disease, your cat must be sprayed with Windex at least 2 times a day. It is the only known chemical able to break down the virus. The Isopropanal found in Windex is what breaks down the genetic structure of Numotoma. Not much is known about Deficitis or the Numotoma parasite associated with it.

An addictive personality refers to a particular set of personality traits that make an individual predisposed to addictions. Addictions are characterized by a physical or psychological dependency that negatively impacts the quality of life of the person. They are frequently connected with substance abuse, but people with addictive personalities are also highly at risk of becoming addicted to gambling, food, exercise, work, and even relationships (codependency) ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). People engaged in addictive behavior tend to plan their lives around it ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). Scientists have been able to better understand addictive personalities as researchers delve further into understanding the chemistry of addiction. Alan R. Lang of Florida State University and author of an addiction study prepared for the National Academy of Sciences said, “If we can better identify the personality factors, they can help us devise better treatment and can open up new strategies to intervene and break the patterns of addiction” (Nelson). \\n\\n==Description==\\nAddictive personality disorder can be defined as a psychological setback that makes people more susceptible to addiction.  This can include anything from drug and alcohol abuse to pornography, gambling, videogames, food, exercise, work and even relations with others.  Experts describe the spectrum of behaviors designated as addictive in terms of five interrelated concepts which include patterns, habits, compulsions, impulse control disorders, and physical addiction ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). An individual is considered to be at the risk of developing such addictions when he/she displays signs of impulsive behavior, nonconformity combined with a weak commitment to the goals for achievement valued by the society, a sense of social alienation, and a sense of heightened stress (Nelson). Such a person may switch from one addiction to another other or even sustain multiple addictions at different times (Mason).\\n\\n==Signs and Symptoms==\\nThe people suffering from addictive personality disorder are currently defined to have a “brain disease” as promoted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and other authorities (Addictive Behaviors 3). People with addictive personalities are very much sensitive to stress. They have trouble handling situations that they deem frustrating, even if the event is for a very short duration. They often lack self-esteem and will show impulsive behavior such as excessive caffeine consumption, eating of chocolates or other sugar laden foods, television watching, or even running (Nelson).\\n\\nMood swings and antisocial behavior are other visible traits of people that suffer from addictive personality disorder. They may turn down invitation to social gatherings in order to alienate themselves from their respective societies.  The main reason behind such behavior is that they are fearful of being caught with this disorder.  The feeling of isolation will often have negative effects on the people that facing the issue, and so to substitute for the lack of personal relationships, they turn towards drugs, smoking, alcohol consumption, or the like.  They usually will believe that such harmful substances serve as “quick-fix" solutions for their life's problems ("Addiction/Addictive Personality").\\n\\nPeople suffering from APD find it difficult to manage their stress levels. In fact, lack of stress tolerance is a telltale sign of the disorder. They find it difficult to face stressful situations and fight hard to get out of such conditions (Mason).\\n\\nLong term goals prove difficult to achieve because people with APD usually focus on the stress that comes with getting through the short term goals.  Such personalities will often switch to other enjoyable activities the moment that they are deprived of enjoyment in their previous addiction.\\n\\nAddictive individuals feel highly insecure when it comes to relationships. They may often find it difficult to make commitments in relationships or trust their beloved because of the difficulty they find in achieving long term goals. They constantly seek approval of others and as a result, and these misunderstandings may contribute to the destruction of relationships.  People suffering from addictive personality disorder usually undergo depression and anxiety, managing their emotions by developing addiction to drugs, alcohol or other pleasurable activities (Nelson).\\n\\n\\n==Common Forms of Addictive Behavior==\\nSubstance abuse and dependence is one of the most common displays of addictive personalities. Alcohol is the most frequently abused psychoactive substance and affects over 20 million Americans—13 percent of the adult population ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). Aside from alcohol, other psychoactive drugs commonly abused include barbiturates, narcotics, stimulants, anti-anxiety drugs, and psychedelics and hallucinogens ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). While drug abuse and dependence can happen to anyone, it is significantly more likely to occur in the presence of an addictive personality. \\n\\nAnother common addiction that may attract those with addictive personalities is gambling. When an addict behaves mindlessly and irresponsibly while gambling, it can grow to be a bigger problem. There are said to be three stages a gambler with an addictive personality goes through (Eng). The first is the “winning phase” in which the person can still control his or her own behavior. Second comes the “losing phase” where the individual starts to gamble alone, borrowing cash and gambling large sums of money compiling debt which he or she may not be able to pay off. Finally, the “desperation phase” of the addictive behavior gambler is when the person takes further risks, may engage in illegal loans and activities and even experience depression or attempt suicide (Eng). \\n\\nAddictive personality behaviors even include eating disorders, such as anorexia, bulimia and compulsive overeating. Those with anorexia nervosa are not content with his or her physical image, and in turn constantly starve him or herself in order to feel beautiful. Once a person starts dieting, it is very difficult for him or her to quit. This is similarly true for those suffering from bulimia. A person is said to have bulimia when he or she binges on large amounts of food and then prevents absorption by purging (laxatives, vomiting, water pills, etc) (Eng). With compulsive eating, the person has a compulsive urge or craving to eat and will eat even when not hungry. This addictive behavior often results in obesity. \\n\\nThree increasingly more common displays of addictive personalities include work and exercise. Our society rewards those who work hard. But work may become an obsession if family, friends, interests and hobbies have suddenly become unimportant. Likewise, an extreme commitment to exercise that can sometimes lead to self destructive and harmful behavior is an example of addictive behavior. \\n\\n==Treatment==\\nAddictive personalities and the subsequent addictions are difficult to treat. Addictive behavior often involves long term psychological ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). Physical addictions even alter an individual’s brain chemistry making the road to recovery longer and more difficult. Often the person with a physical addiction cannot be exposed to the addictive habit without lapsing back into addiction. This is why rates of being “cured” are often closely followed by setbacks. The first step in the recovery process of addictive behaviors is to admit that there is a problem and seek help. Medical intervention may be necessary for those who engage in substance abuse—medication is often used to treat withdrawal symptoms and treat for malnutrition. Many forms of psychological intervention are also available to those with addictive personalities including counseling and inpatient programs, group therapy, environmental intervention and behavior therapy ("Addiction/Addictive Personality").\\n\\n==References==\\n* "Addiction/Addictive Personality."

Re:  Water Fluoridation Controversy\\n\\nI read Wikipedia's piece Water Fluoridation Controversy, and I browsed a few individual comments concerning the write-up on this topic. Overall I was disappointed, as I found this piece to be very slanted to a pro-fluoridation status quo. I was especially disappointed with the section citing water fluoridation in courts of law, as there was NO MENTIONING of three landmark cases in Illinois, Texas, and Pennsylvania where in two cases water fluoridation was judged as posing a hazard to public health, and in the Illinois case the judge ruled that the Illinois legislature's mandatory fluoridation law was at odds with the scientific evidence, i.e., that fluoridation of water has not been shown to be both safe and effective. The notion that there has been no critical adjudications on water fluoridation is absolutely an outright deception. The fact that these three landmark cases were omitted demonstrates clearly the author's pro-fluoridation bias.\\n\\nWikipedia, you should be able to do better than this.
I am trained in biochemistry at a liberal arts college.  My first and only fluent language is English, although I've taken a major interest in Spanish and also Greek, Latin and maybe even French.  I am also interested in food, music, health, math, computers, physics, systems and informatics, and business and money.  I have never been intrinsically interested in social studies including the broad areas of politics and sociology; I do however try to make concerted efforts to learn within these areas.\\n\\nOn the topic of Wikipedia, I believe this is a powerful and invaluable resource for the world.  I do acknowledge the concerns -- aired mostly by academics -- that open editing compromises the potential accuracy of Wikipedia articles.  However, as long as academics and general users at large understand the value of this online resource as an indicator of the general public's knowledge about included topics, we can better appreciate and use this information concurrent with a healthy skepticism.
As a physicist and chemical engineer, my scientific loyalties sometimes conflict with my spiritual loyalties.   As a philosopher, seeking eternal, universal truths, my discoveries are being chronicled in a book which I call, True Freedom, which finds much resonance with Ayn Rand's Objectivism and Individualism.\\n\\nTrue Freedom requires individual equality, lest one person or group infringe upon the freedoms of others.  Therefore privacy establishes impartiality and fairness.  Privacy protects individuals from inequality by restricting the ability to discern and thus segregate individuals or groups by any particular characteristic.  Security requires that every person be uniquely, positively, and easily identified so that trust may abound and privacy may be most fully preserved.  True Democracy extends equality by allowing every citizen an equal voice in matters of governance (that there may be no masters or tyrants).
Shower science: scientific research or empirical study to discover laws governing the operation and practical use of any showering system being domestic, commercial, military, aerospace, hybrid or other.\\n\\nThe advent of "hybrid showering systems" is rather new. Powerful consumption made possible by a highly automated destruction of vast quantities of hydrocarbons from the Earth, have in a sense over a short time developed a "blind spot" that camouflages the heinous waste of thermal energy, water, and consumables like soap that the contemporary but still extremely primitive bathroom shower system requires to operate.\\n\\nIt was found that only one energy saving hybrid showering system could save energy than a small town where all the lights were on only.\\n\\nThe practical laws that govern "extreme waste" in contemporary showers was first discovered by Michael Vittorio Collalto who in the period during 1986 and particularly from 1994 onwards set about materializing what has become this worlds first "hybrid showering system".\\n\\nIt gradually incorporated a research facility, used to test the hypothesis amongst others that the shower seemed to be no better than an efficient "cooling tower", amazingly adverse to the aim of providing a warm or hot environment.\\n\\nIt mimics the operation of a cooling tower in almost every respect.\\n\\nThe similarities are staggering.\\n\\n(used to cool water in order to improve the efficiency of the refrigeration cycle in larger applications. e.g. commercial buildings.)\\n\\nA technology specifically to remove thermal potential from water efficiently. \\n\\nA further observation has persisted, that according to this discovery, although it might seem desirable to recover heat at the drain from the showering process and others like in the kitchen sink, most of the thermal potential in typical primitive showering systems is removed well before the water reaches the drain where any substantially meaningful recovery can occur.
A large proportion of homes include traditional radiators for heating, which over the years, have been mainly left uncovered, but due to growing demand and the awareness caused by exposure on TV shows, radiator cabinets have changed from an upmarket fashion accessory to an essential item in the home. Providing effective protection against coming into contact with hot surfaces is important for all members of the family, especially the young and elderly. Adding covers eliminates the likelihood of this occurring whilst creating attractive room features throughout the home. An ever increasing selection of cabinets in a variety of styles and finishes is available nationwide in standard sizes to cover the majority of UK radiators and adjustable versions are also available. These are designed to fit a number of different sized radiators by adjusting in width to provide a custom made look. With special made to measure services ensuring non-standard radiators can also be covered, homeowners will welcome the safety and aesthetic benefits of adding radiator cabinet.
\\n== History ==\\n\\nOver the past 20 years, the Dutch Postcode Lottery raised almost 3 billion euros in the Netherlands to support civil society: environmental protection, the conservation of nature, human rights and sustainable development. From the very beginning the lottery supported charitable organisations both international and in the Netherlands by raising money through a lottery and informing the public about the work of the charities concerned. With its 2.5 million participants, the lottery has grown to become the Netherlands’ biggest charity lottery and it supports 75 charitable organisations.\\n\\n== International Scope ==\\n\\nThe Postcode Lottery was also introduced internationally and is now established and successful in Sweden, England and Scotland.

\\nJet streams are fast flowing, narrow air currents found in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth. The main jet streams are located near the tropopause, the transition between the troposphere (where temperature decreases with altitude) and the stratosphere (where temperature increases with altitude).[1] The major jet streams on Earth are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a meandering shape; jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including the opposite direction of most of the jet. The strongest jet streams are the Polar jets, at around 7–12 km (23,000–39,000 ft) above sea level, and the higher and somewhat weaker Subtropical jets at around 10–16 km (33,000–52,000 ft). The Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere each have both a polar jet and a subtropical jet. The northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia and their intervening oceans, while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica all year round.\\nJet streams are caused by a combination of a planet's rotation on its axis and atmospheric heating (by solar radiation and, on some planets other than Earth, internal heat). Jet streams form near boundaries of adjacent air masses with significant differences in temperature, such as the polar region and the warmer air towards the equator.[2]\\nMeteorologists use the location of some of the jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting. The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against the flow of a jet stream. Clear-air turbulence, a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety, often is found in a jet stream's vicinity. One future benefit of jet streams could be to power airborne wind turbines.\\nOther jet streams also exist. During the northern hemisphere summer, easterly jets can form in tropical regions, typically in a region where dry air encounters more humid air at high altitudes. Low-level jets also are typical of various regions such as the central United States. \\nA narrow current of strong wind circling the Earth from west to east at altitudes of about 11 to 13 km (7 to 8 mi) above sea level. There are usually four distinct jet streams, two each in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Jet stream wind speeds average 56 km (34 mi) per hour in the summer and 120 km (74 mi) in the winter. They are caused by significant differences in the temperatures of adjacent air masses. These differences occur where cold, polar air meets warmer, equatorial air, especially in the latitudes of the westerlies.

The MWRD expects this new energy source to supply the Kirie Water Reclamation Plant in Des Plaines, Illinois, with up to 40 percent of its heating and cooling energy needs. This plan could provide a model for heating and cooling energy needs at other MWRD facilities and for other facilities around the world. The sewerthermal system takes advantage of relatively constant high temperatures of effluent water and uses only 20 percent or less power than what is needed for a traditional, direct heating system. Rather than extracting heat from the ground as is common for geothermal systems, the MWRD’s system is designed to extract heat from the effluent water, which holds a steady minimum temperature of 55 degrees Fahrenheit.\\n[[Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago]]
The purpose of the article in progress, "Celtic Music and American Identity", is to understand how layers of American Identity have been construed based on an influx of Celtic music. The article intends to inform on the diaspora of Celtic music to America in the 19th and 20th centuries and its effect on cultural and ideological aspects such as musical fusion (Celtic Rock, Celtic Punk, Celtic Pop, etc.) and social elements (i.e. tattoo art, festivals, pubs) that are now distinctly American. \\n\\nThis article is written based on guidelines and for fulfillment of the course 'Music in International Relations' at Denison University, Spring 2012. The course focuses on various topics in International Studies in relation to music, such as peace concerts, concert aesthetics, and the relationship between musical and social harmonies. Studies in History and Religion has inspired the topic of this article, in addition to an immersion in Scottish and Celtic culture.
The French Revolution was a true revolution due to the fact that it follows many of the steps necessary to be called a revolution.  One step that should be mentioned is that the public was willing to use violence in order to protect the Third Estate.   This is significant due to the fact that the Third Estate is able to make the changes to the government that people want.  This is shown in the Storming of Bastille where revolutionists broke into the fortress in order to seize gunpowder and weapons.  In Addition, this act convinced King Louis XVI to withdraw his troops from Paris.   Withdrawing his troops showed that he was intimidated by the people, a major step in a revolution.  This also shows the weakness of the French government, which makes the people confident in a revolution.  This step leads to many different steps needed to revolutionize a country. ~tony's

Power Electronics Education E-Book\\n\\nwww.peeeb.com\\n\\nDr. Firuz Zare\\n\\n'Globalization' is a simple way of describing the spread of communication and technologies across the world. As the store of knowledge expands throughout the world, all of the world’s people should have as much access as possible. There are a range of new technologies and techniques such as the Internet, World Wide Web and other electronic media forms that allow for the dissemination of data, information and knowledge. These advanced information and communications technologies can provide a new learning system that aid professors and students in breaking the boundaries of space and time and assist students in gaining the skills and abilities and utilise knowledge contained in various forms in our global. I believe there is a need for enhanced virtual and networked activity to support learning and share our knowledge especially in some developing countries! After many years working in industry and university, I have decided to share my knowledge and experience with all students in the world who study Electrical Engineering. Now, it is not a dream anymore! In this website, you can virtually attend my lectures, tutorials, computer Labs and quizzes and also access to lecture notes.
ALIA Institute\\n\\nThe ALIA Institute is a non-profit charitable organization located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It aims to support community and organizational leaders by bringing together systems-oriented tools and perspectives with the values and practices of authentic leadership. \\n\\nThe Institute began in 1998 as a dialogue among members of the Shambhala meditation community who were actively engaged in business, education, and civil society, and pioneering leaders in the fields of organizational and societal change - pathfinders such as Peter Senge, Margaret Wheatley, Juanita Brown, David Isaacs, and Art Kleiner. The intention behind this exploration was to discover a new model of leadership development that would adequately prepare organizational leaders for the challenges of the 21st century. This model would bring together Shambhala, as a source of pre-industrial wisdom and practices for realizing the potential of individuals and societies, with post-industrial research and methodologies related to leadership and whole-systems change.\\n\\nThis fusion turned out to be a powerful support for more effective action, especially in the domains of innovation, strategy, collaboration, and large-scale transformative change. It resulted in the week-long Authentic Leadership Summer Program, which was first offered in Nova Scotia in June 2001 and which has convened annually ever since.
The Change in female labor force in the United States and the introduction of the contraceptive pill\\n\\nFrom 1890 to mid 1970, although the female labor force participation in the states has increased steadily, most female workers were secondary earners and worked as secretaries, teachers, nurses etc. However, started from mid 1970, “quiet revolution” took place. Women not only participated in labor force, they also began to have long-term investment in graduate education and became career oriented. For example, in the 1970s, women increased to major in business administration and reduced their concentration on traditional female fields of education, such as home economics education and education. Women also began to further their education in professional schools at around 1970 (Goldin 10). \\n\\nIn fact, according to professor Claudia Goldin, one of the main reasons that women changed to be career oriented in 1970 was the introduction of the contraceptive pill. Contraceptive pill was approved and diffused among young women in the late 1960s and early 1970s. With the introduction of the pill, women increased the age of first marriage (Goldin 10-11). More importantly, the birth control pill provides a right and power for women to actively decide whether to have a child or not. \\n\\nReference: \\nGoldin, Claudia. “The Quiet Revolution That Transformed Women’s Employment, Education, and Family” (May 2006)
'''SCHOLAR RESCUE FUND'''\\n\\nEvery day scholars in some part of the world are threatened, harassed, arrested, tortured or even killed by governments, militants, and extremists of all types who see scholars’ efforts to promote thinking, dialogue, and wider understanding as threats to their authority and control. \\n\\n'''ESTABLISHING THE FUND'''\\n\\nAround the world, scholars have long suffered harassment, torture and persecution as a result of their work. In the worst cases, scholars pay with their lives for their dedication to scholarship and freedom of thought. In the post-Cold War era, the need to protect scholars has only increased.\\n\\nIn response to this ongoing international dilemma, the Institute of International Education (IIE), under the leadership of trustees Dr. Henry Jarecki and Thomas Russo, along with George Soros’ Open Society Institute, launched the Scholar Rescue Fund (SRF). The Fund provides fellowships to support temporary visits by threatened scholars to institutions in any safe country, anywhere in the world. \\n\\nThese fellowships support temporary academic positions at safe universities and colleges anywhere in the world. SRF scholars contribute to their host universities through teaching, research, lectures and other activities. In return, host universities provide professional guidance and financial and in-kind support. Scholars from any country may qualify.  At the end of their fellowships, scholars return to help rebuild countries ravaged by conflict, repression and fear. When safe return is not possible, SRF staff work with scholars to identify opportunities to continue their work abroad.\\n\\nIn 2002, the Institute’s trustees committed to making scholar rescue a permanent part of its work.  The Scholar Rescue Fund builds on work done by the Institute since its founding in 1919.  By assuring that persecuted scholars can get to a safe place and continue their work, we shine the light on those who would terrorize them and in the process threaten world peace.  We also help to preserve the intellectual capital of humanity, which is vital for progress.
\\n\\nThe great california became a country in 2007. The president [['''Mark Yudof''']] helped the country in many amazing ways. he helps with the economic troubles and all of the difficulties california has had in the past. The administration that he works with will seek to get around those rulings through a complex gas tax swap. As part of the scheme, an existing sales tax on gasoline would be eliminated and, at the same time, a new per-gallon excise tax would be imposed. The price at the pump would drop about 5 cents per gallon.\\n\\nThe shift would gut a voter-approved measure, Proposition 42, that protects how current gas taxes are spent. Public transit -- buses, rail and other forms of mass transportation -- now receives 20% of all gas sales tax. After the tax swap, that requirement would disappear. The tax swap could also cost schools -- as it would result in the share of tax revenues they are entitled to under state law dropping by more than $800 million.\\n\\nTo read more, click here.\\n \\nPPIC Report Analyzes How Counties are Dealing with Fiscal Crisis\\nDec. 21 -- The Public Policy Institute of California has released a report titled "Perceptions of Local Fiscal Stress During a State Budget Crisis,"  which details how California counties and cities are dealing with their own current fiscal crises.\\n\\nAccording to the report"s summary, "City and county governments in California have been hit hard by the state's recent budgetary and economic difficulties.

KSDF’S STATEMENT ON INTERNATIONAL DAY OF ACTION FOR RIVERS\\n\\nDated: New Delhi, 14 March 2008\\n\\nOn this day, the 11th International Day of Action for Rivers, the Kuki Students Democratic Front and the Burma Rivers Network are calling for an end to the destructive Tamanthi Dam and all other mega dams in Burma. \\n\\nIndian, Chinese, and Thai companies are planning large dams across all of Burma’s major rivers and their tributaries. In collaboration with the Government of India, the 1,200 megawatt “Tamanthi Dam and Multi Purpose Project” is being implemented since 2005 by Indian Government in collaboration with National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC). This project is in the heart of ethnic Kuki inhabited areas in Sagaing Division, where the local people from the dam site Tazone Shan and Leivomjang Kuki village have already been relocated from their ancestral land and many more villages to be relocate if the construction is to be continues. \\n\\nThe dam will adversely affect the rich biodiversity and ecological balance in the region due to dramatic changes in the morphology of the riverbed. Burma’s Tamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary that provides habitat for many endemic species of flora and fauna will also be impacted. From 1990 to 2005, Burma lost 18% of its forest cover due to damming and logging. This is one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world. \\n\\nIn recent years, Chinese companies have been involved in the planning of 25 large dams on the Irrawaddy, Salween, and Sittaung rivers or their tributaries. The dams have an estimated combined capacity of 30,000 megawatts and represent US$30 billion worth of investment. Large-scale displacement, militarization, human rights abuse, and irreversible environmental damage due to the dam projects are threatening the livelihoods and food security of millions. \\n\\nThe bulk of the electricity generated from these projects is slated to be exported to neighbouring countries or will be consumed by military bases. Revenues from the sale of electricity will provide significant long-term income to the military regime which spends 40% of its budget on defense while the expenditure on health and education is below 5%.\\n\\nThe number of military battalions stationed near dam site areas has tripled in the last ten years. In areas where many of the dams are being implemented war continues to take a heavy toll or serious tensions threaten the ceasefires with ethnic groups. At the same time, the crackdown on peaceful demonstrations of monks in late 2007 clearly shows the impossibility of public participation in decisions over energy policies in Burma.\\n\\nDam projects in Burma are going ahead without regard for internationally accepted standards laid out by the World Commission on Dams and the Equator Principles, which include public participation in decision making, effective environmental mitigation, and equitable benefit sharing. Therefore the Tamanthi Dam and all other mega dams in Burma must be stopped.\\n\\nKuki Students Democratic Front (KSDF)\\nBurma Rivers Network (BRN)\\n\\n\\n\\nBy. Mangneo
Introduction\\n\\nDifferential equations arise in many areas of science and technology; whenever a deterministic relationship involving some continuously changing quantities (modeled by functions) and their rates of change (expressed as derivatives) is known or postulated. This is well illustrated by classical mechanics, where the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time varies. Newton's Laws allow one to relate the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body and state this relation as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time. In many cases, this differential equation may be solved, yielding the law of motion.\\n\\nDifferential equations are mathematically studied from several different perspectives, mostly concerned with their solutions, functions that make the equation hold true. Only the simplest differential equations admit solutions given by explicit formulas. Many properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without finding their exact form. If a self-contained formula for the solution is not available, the solution may be numerically approximated using computers. The theory of dynamical systems puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations, while many numerical methods have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy.

Waterspouts exist on a microscale, where their environment is less than two kilometers in width. Their bigger cloud that develops them can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus, or as great as a supercell. While some waterspouts are strong (tornadic) like their land-based counterparts, most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics. They normally develop in moisture-laden environments with little vertical wind shear along lines of convergence, such as land breezes, lake effect bands, lines of frictional convergence from nearby landmasses, or surface troughs. Waterspouts normally develop as their parent clouds are in the process of development, and it is theorized that they spin up as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal shear near the surface, and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus or thunderstorm. Weak tornadoes, known as landspouts, have been shown to develop in a similar manner.[2]

"Anorexia mirabilis literally means "miraculous lack of appetite". It refers almost exclusively to women and girls of the Middle Ages who would starve themselves, sometimes to the death, in the name of God. The phenomenon is also known by the name "inedia prodigiosa" (a great starvation).[1]\\n\\nAnorexia mirabilis differs from the more modern, well-known anorexia nervosa in several distinct ways.\\n\\nIn anorexia nervosa, people usually starve themselves to attain a level of thinness, as the disease is associated with body image distortion. By contrast, anorexia mirabilis was frequently coupled with other ascetic practices, such as lifelong chastity, flagellant behavior, the donning of hairshirts, sleeping on beds of thorns, and other assorted self mutilations. It was largely a practice of Catholic women, who were often known as "miraculous maids".\\n\\nUntil recently, plumpness was a clear sign of affluence, and emaciation either a sign of poverty, ill health, or both. Women did not typically begin depriving themselves of food for outer beauty until the Victorian era, they did however starve themselves for spiritual fulfillment."
''New data on Mars's underground ice shows that the red planet likely has a very active water cycle.  Using heat emission observations from the Mars Odyssey spacecraft, researchers were able to map seasonal changes in the temperature of the red planet's surface to locate and measure the buried ice.   "This gives us a more detailed picture of the underground ice on Mars," said Joshua Bandfield, a research specialist at Arizona State University's School of Earth and Space Exploration in Tempe, who led the study.  The findings, which are reported in the May 3 issue of the journal Nature, show that the depth of the water-ice table varies greatly on Mars.  The results also suggest that water ice and water vapor in the planet's atmosphere can swap places as the planet undergoes regular cycles of warming and cooling.

In the former case, clients, customers and end-users need to be informed about the potential impact of their decisions on the provision of space, services, cost and business risk. In the latter, it is the role of a facility manager to ensure corporate and regulatory [[Regulatory compliance]] plus the proper operation of all aspects of a building to create an optimal, safe and cost effective environment for the occupants to function. This is accomplished by managing some of the following activities
{{Business administration}}\\n{{short description|Trade of goods, services, technology, capital's and/or knowledge at a transnational scale}}\\n'''International business''' refers to the trade of Goods and service goods, services, technology, capital and/or knowledge across national borders and at a global or transnational scale. \\n\\nIt involves cross-border [[Financial transaction|transactions]] of goods and services between two or more countries. Transactions of economic resources include capital, skills, and people for the purpose of the international production of physical goods and services such as finance, banking, insurance, and construction. International business is also known as [[globalization]].\\n\\nInternational business encompasses a myriad of crucial elements vital for global economic integration and growth. At its core, it involves the exchange of goods, services, and capital across national borders. One of its pivotal aspects is globalization, which has significantly altered the landscape of trade by facilitating increased interconnectedness between nations. International business thrives on the principle of comparative advantage, wherein countries specialize in producing goods and services they can produce most efficiently. This specialization fosters efficiency, leading to optimal resource allocation and higher overall productivity. Moreover, international business fosters cultural exchange and understanding by promoting interactions between people of diverse backgrounds. However, it also poses challenges, such as navigating complex regulatory frameworks, cultural differences, and geopolitical tensions. Effective international business strategies require astute market analysis, risk assessment, and adaptation to local customs and preferences. The role of technology cannot be overstated, as advancements in communication and transportation have drastically reduced barriers to entry and expanded market reach. Additionally, international business plays a crucial role in sustainable development, as companies increasingly prioritize ethical practices, environmental responsibility, and social impact. Collaboration between governments, businesses, and international organizations is essential to address issues like climate change, labor rights, and economic inequality. In essence, international business is a dynamic force driving economic growth, fostering global cooperation, and shaping the future of commerce on a worldwide scale.\\n\\nTo conduct business overseas, multinational companies need to bridge separate national [[Market (economics)|markets]] into one global marketplace. There are two macro-scale factors that underline the trend of greater globalization. The first consists of eliminating [[Trade barrier|barriers]] to make cross-border trade easier (e.g. free flow of goods and services, and capital, referred to as "[[free trade]]"). The second is technological change, particularly developments in communication, [[Electronic data processing|information processing]], and [[Freight transport|transportation]] technologies.\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nThe discourse surrounding international business has  a transition in terminology over the years, reflecting shifts in understanding and the expanding scope of cross-border commerce. Initially, phrases such as "foreign trade" and "foreign exchange" were prevalent, embodying a static view of cross-border interactions. However, the term "foreign" often evoked notions of remoteness or strangeness, failing to capture the dynamic essence of international engagements.\\n\\nAs commerce evolved with the advent of firms engaging in substantial direct investments across borders, newer terms  to encapsulate the changing landscape. The mid-19th century marked the rise of companies owning and controlling production facilities in various countries, a departure from the earlier norm where firms held minor or passive ("portfolio") investments abroad. This paradigm shift necessitated a fresh nomenclature, leading to the introduction of the term "multinational enterprise" (MNE), referring to entities with substantial operations in multiple nations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burleigh |first1=Thomas D. |title=The Indian Tree Pipit (Anthus hodgsoni) Recorded for the First Time in North America |journal=The Auk |date=1968 |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=323 |doi=10.2307/4083598 |jstor=4083598 }}</ref>\\n\\n"International business" is also defined as the study of the internationalization process of multinational enterprises. A [[multinational enterprise]] (MNE) is a company that has a worldwide approach to markets, production and/or operations in several countries. Well-known MNEs include fast-food companies such as: McDonald's (MCD), YUM (YUM), Starbucks Coffee Company (SBUX), etc. Other industrial MNEs leaders include vehicle manufacturers such as: Ford Motor Company, and General Motors (GMC). Some consumer electronics producers such as Samsung, LG and Sony, and energy companies such as Exxon Mobil, and British Petroleum (BP) are also multinational enterprises.\\n\\nMultinational enterprises range from any kind of business activity or market, from consumer goods to machinery manufacture; a company can become an international business. Therefore, to conduct business overseas, companies should be aware of all the factors that might affect any business activities, including, but not limited to: difference in legal systems, political systems, [[economic policy]], [[language barrier|language]], [[accounting standard]]s, [[International labour law|labor standards]], living standards, [[environmental standard]]s, [[culture|local culture]]s, [[Organizational culture|corporate cultures]], [[Foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange markets]], [[tariff]]s, [[import]] and [[export]] regulations, [[trade agreement]]s, [[climate]], and [[education]]. Each of these factors may require changes in how companies operate from one country to another. Each factor makes a difference and a connection.\\n\\nOne of the first scholars to engage in developing a theory of multinational companies was Canadian economist [[Stephen Hymer]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Buckley |first1=Peter J. |title=Stephen Hymer: Three phases, one approach? |journal=International Business Review |date=April 2006 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=140–147 |doi=10.1016/j.ibusrev.2005.03.008 }}</ref> Throughout his academic life, he developed theories that sought to explain [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) and why firms become multinational.\\n\\nThere were three phases of [[internationalization]] according to Hymer's work.<ref>{{cite thesis |last1=Hymer |first1=Stephen H. |title=The international operations of national firms, a study of direct foreign investment |date=1960 |hdl=1721.1/27375 |hdl-access=free }}{{pn|date=March 2024}}</ref> In this thesis, the author departs from [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical theory]] and opens up a new area of international production. At first, Hymer started analyzing neoclassical theory and [[financial investment]], where the main reason for [[capital movement]] is the [[Interest rate parity|difference in interest rates]]. After this analysis, Hymer analyzed the characteristics of foreign investment by large companies for [[Production (economics)|production]] and direct business purposes, calling this Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). By analyzing the two types of investments, Hymer distinguished financial investment from direct investment. The main distinguishing feature was control. [[Portfolio investment]] is a more passive approach, and the main purpose is [[Profit (economics)|financial gain]], whereas in foreign direct investment a firm has control over the [[Operations management|operations]] abroad. So, the traditional theory of investment based on differential interest rates does not explain the motivations for FDI.\\n\\nAccording to Hymer, there are two main determinants of FDI; where an [[imperfect market]] structure is the key element. The first is the [[Competitive advantage|firm-specific advantages]] which are developed at the specific companies home country and, profitably, used in the foreign country. The second determinant is the removal of control where Hymer wrote: "When firms are interconnected, they [[Competition (economics)|compete]] in selling in the same market or one of the firms may sell to the other," and because of this "it may be profitable to substitute centralized decision-making for [[decentralized decision-making]]".\\n\\nHymer's second phase is his neoclassical article in 1968 that includes a theory of internationalization and explains the direction of growth of the international expansion of firms. In a later stage, Hymer went to a more [[Marxian economics|Marxist]] approach where he explains that MNC as agents of an international capitalist system causing conflict and contradictions, causing among other things [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[poverty]] in the world. Hymer is the "father of the theory of MNEs", and explains the motivations for companies doing direct business abroad.\\n\\nAmong modern economic theories of multinationals and foreign direct investment are [[internalization theory]] and [[John Harry Dunning|John Dunning's]] [[Eclectic paradigm|OLI paradigm]] (standing for ''ownership, location and internationalization''). Dunning was widely known for his research in economics of international direct investment and the multinational enterprise. His OLI paradigm, in particular, remains as the predominant theoretical contribution to study international business topics. Hymer and Dunning are considered [[Organizational founder|founders]] of international business as a specialist [[field of study]].\\n\\n==Physical and social factors of competitive business and social environment==\\nThe conduct of international operations depends on a company's objectives and the means with which they carry them out. The operations affect and are affected by the physical and societal factors and the [[competitive]] [[social environment|environment]].\\n\\n===Operations===\\nAll firms that want to go international have one goal in common; the desire to increase their respective [[Economic value added|economic values]] when engaging in international trade transactions. To accomplish this goal, each firm must develop its individual strategy and approach to maximize [[Value (economics)|value]], lower costs, and increase profits.  A firm's value creation is the difference between {{Math|''V''}} (the value of the product being sold) and {{Math|''C''}} (the cost of production per each product sold).{{sfn|Hill|2014|p=382}}\\n\\n[[Value creation]] can be categorized as: ''primary activities'' ([[research and development]], production, marketing and sales, [[customer service]]) and as ''support activities'' (information systems, logistics, human resources).{{sfn|Hill|2014|p=383}} All of these activities must be managed effectively and be consistent with the [[Corporate strategy|firm strategy]]. However, the success of firms that extend internationally depends on the goods or services sold and on the firm's core competencies (Skills within the firm that competitors cannot easily match or imitate). For a firm to be successful, the firm's strategy must be consistent with the environment in which the firm operates. Therefore, the firm needs to change its [[organizational structure]] to reflect changes in the setting in which they are operating and the strategy they are pursuing.\\n\\nOnce a firm decides to enter a foreign market, it must decide on a mode of entry. There are six different modes to enter a foreign market, and each mode has [[wiktionary:pros and cons|pros and cons]] that are associated with it. The firm must decide which mode is most appropriately aligned with the company's goals and objectives.  The six different modes of entry are exporting,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp|title=Export|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-19|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}</ref> [[turnkey project]]s, [[License|licensing]], [[franchising]], establishing [[joint venture]]s with a host-country firm, or setting up a new [[wholly owned subsidiary]] in the host country.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=453–454}}\\n\\nThe first entry mode is [[exporting]]. Exporting is the sale of a product in a different national market than a centralized hub of manufacturing. In this way, a firm may realize a substantial [[Economies of scale|scale of economies]] from its global sales revenue. As an example, many [[Automotive industry in Japan|Japanese automakers]] made inroads into the [[Automotive industry in the United States|U.S. market]] through exporting.  There are two primary advantages to exporting:  avoiding high costs of establishing manufacturing in a host country (when these are higher) and gaining an [[Experience curve effects|experience curve]].  Some possible disadvantages to exporting are high transport costs and high [[Tariff|tariff barriers]].{{sfn|Hill|2014|p=454}}\\n\\nThe second entry mode is a turnkey project. In a turnkey project, an independent contractor is hired by the company to oversee all of the preparation for entering a foreign market.  Once the preparation is complete and the end of the contract is reached, the plant is turned over to the company fully ready for operation.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=454–455}}\\n\\nLicensing and franchising are two additional entry modes that are similar in operation. Licensing allows a [[licensor]] to grant the rights to an intangible property to the licensee for a specified period of time for a royalty fee. Franchising, on the other hand, is a specialized form of licensing in which the "franchisor" sells the [[intangible property]] to the franchisee, and also requires the franchisee operate as dictated by the franchisor.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=456–457}}\\n\\nLastly, a joint venture and wholly owned subsidiary are two more entry modes in international business. A ''joint venture'' is when a firm created is jointly owned by two or more companies (Most joint venture are 50-50 [[partnership]]s). This is in contrast with a wholly owned subsidiary, when a firm owns 100 percent of the [[Capital stock|stock]] of a company in a foreign country because it has either set up a new operation or [[Corporate acquisition|acquires]] an established firm in that country.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=457–458}}\\n\\n====Types of operations====\\n[[Export]]s and [[import]] \\n* Merchandise exports: goods exported{{Em dash}}not including services.<ref>[http://thelawdictionary.org/merchandise-exports/ What is Merchandised Exports].

An example of this is that [[Colombia]] must import cars since there is no Colombian car company.\\n*[[Offshoring|Service exports]]: {{As of|2018}}, the fastest growing export sector.

These channels play a crucial role in keeping stakeholders informed about global market trends, emerging opportunities, and potential risks. Here are some of the key types of international business media:\\n\\n*Industry-Specific Publications:* Specialized magazines, journals, and newsletters that focus on particular industries or sectors, providing in-depth analysis, expert commentary, and industry news.\\n\\n*Financial News Outlets:* Global media organizations that report on financial markets, economic developments, and business performance, offering insights into investment opportunities and economic trends.\\n\\n*Business Television Networks:* Broadcast and online channels dedicated to business news, featuring interviews with CEOs, market analysis, and reports on global business events.\\n\\n*Online Business Resources:* Websites, blogs, and social media platforms that provide news, analysis, and commentary on international business, often catering to specific regions or industries.\\n\\nIn addition  to traditional media, there are also a number of social media channels that focus on international business. These channels can be a good way to stay up-to-date on the latest news and developments, and they can also be a valuable platform for connecting with other businesses and professionals.\\n\\n===Physical and social factors===\\n* Geographical influences: There are many different geographic factors that affect international business. These factors are: the geographical size, the [[Climate change|climatic challenges]] happening throughout the world, the [[natural resource]]s available on a specific territory, the [[Population density|population distribution]] in a country, etc.<ref name=witiger>\\nWitiger, (2012).

The use of conventional [[SWOT analysis]], [[market research]], and cultural research, will give a firm appropriate tools to reduce risk of failure abroad. Risks that arise from poor planning include: large expenses in marketing, administration and product development (with no sales); disadvantages derived from local or federal laws of a foreign country, lack of popularity because of a [[Market saturation|saturated market]], vandalism of physical property due to instability of country; etc. There are also cultural risks when entering a foreign market.

The government might be [[Corruption|corrupt]], hostile, or [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]; and may have a negative image around the globe. A firm's reputation can change if it operates in a country controlled by that type of government.<ref name="okolo2"/> Also, an unstable political situation can be a risk for multinational firms. [[Elections]] or any unexpected political event can change a country's situation and put a firm in an awkward position.<ref name=heinsz>J. Henisz, W. and A. Zelner, B. (2010). [https://hbr.org/2010/04/the-hidden-risks-in-emerging-markets|The Hidden Risks in Emerging Markets]. Harvard Business Review. Accessed 9 May 2015.</ref> Political risks are the likelihood that political forces will cause drastic changes in a country's business environment that hurt the profit and other goals of a business enterprise. Political risk tends to be greater in countries experiencing [[social unrest]]. When political risk is high, there is a high probability that a change will occur in the country's political environment that will endanger foreign firms there. Corrupt foreign governments may also [[Expropriation|take over the company without warning]], as seen in Venezuela.<ref name="Charles H.L Hill">Charles H.L Hill</ref>\\n*'''Technological risk'''\\n\\nTechnological improvements bring many benefits, but some disadvantages as well. Some of these risks include "lack of [[Information security|security in electronic transactions]], the [[Non-recurring engineering|cost of developing new technology]] ... the fact that this new technology may fail, and, when all of these are coupled with the outdated existing technology, [the fact that] the result may create a dangerous effect in doing business in the international arena."<ref name="okolo2"/>\\n* '''Environmental risk'''\\n\\nCompanies that establish a subsidiary or factory abroad need to be conscious about the externalizations they will produce, as some may have negative effects such as [[Noise pollution|noise]] or [[pollution]].  This may cause aggravation to the people living there, which in turn can lead to a conflict. People want to live in a clean and quiet environment, without pollution or unnecessary noise. If a conflict arises, this may lead to a negative change in customer's perception of the company. Actual or potential threat of adverse effects on living organisms and environment by effluents, emissions, wastes, [[resource depletion]], etc., arising out of an organization's activities is considered to be risks of the environment. As new business leaders come to fruition in their careers, it will be increasingly important to curb business activities and externalizations that may hurt the environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/environmental-risk.html|title=What is environmental risk? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|access-date=27 March 2018|archive-date=19 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200919103509/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/environmental-risk.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\\n\\n* '''Economic risk''' \\nThese are the economic risks explained by Professor Okolo: "This comes from the inability of a country to meet its financial obligations. The changing of foreign-investment or/and domestic fiscal or monetary policies. The effect of exchange-rate and interest rate make it difficult to conduct international business."<ref name="okolo2"/> Moreover, it can be a risk for a company to operate in a country and they may experience an unexpected economic crisis after establishing the subsidiary.<ref name=heinsz /> Economic risks is the likelihood that economic management will cause drastic changes in a country's business environment that hurt the profit and other goals of a business enterprise. In practice, the biggest problem arising from economic mismanagement has been inflation. Historically many governments have expanded their domestic money supplying misguided attempts to stimulate economic activity.<ref name="Charles H.L Hill"/>\\n* '''Financial risk'''\\n\\nAccording to Professor Okolo: "This area is affected by the currency exchange rate, government flexibility in allowing the firms to [[Repatriation|repatriate]] profits or funds outside the country. The [[devaluation]] and inflation will also affect the firm's ability to operate at an efficient capacity and still be stable."<ref name="okolo2"/> Furthermore, the [[tax]]es that a company has to pay might be advantageous or not. It might be higher or lower in the host countries. Then "the risk that a government will indiscriminately change the laws, regulations, or contracts governing an investment—or will fail to [[Enforcement|enforce]] them—in a way that reduces an investor's [[financial return]]s is what we call 'policy risk.'"<ref name=heinsz /> Exchange rates can fluctuate rapidly for a variety of reasons, including economic instability and diplomatic issues. <ref>{{cite web |title=These Are Four Risks of Doing International Business |url=https://www.bnsgoglobal.com/four-risks-of-doing-international-business/ |website=Business Navigational Solutions |date=27 March 2022 |access-date=3 May 2022}}</ref>\\n* '''Terrorism'''\\n\\n[[Terrorism]] is a voluntary act of violence towards a group(s) of people. In most cases, acts of terrorism is derived from hatred of religious, political and cultural beliefs. An example was the infamous [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], labeled as terrorism due to the [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks|massive damages]] inflicted on [[Society of the United States|American society]] and the global economy stemming from the animosity towards [[Western culture]] by some [[Radical Islam|radical Islamic groups]]. Terrorism not only affects civilians, but it also damages corporations and other businesses. These effects may include: physical [[vandalism]] or [[destruction of property]], sales declining due to frightened consumers and governments issuing public safety restrictions. Firms engaging in international business will find it difficult to operate in a country that has an uncertain assurance of safety from these attacks.<ref name="okolo2"/>\\n* '''Bribery'''\\n\\n[[Bribery]] is the act of receiving or soliciting of any items or services of value to influence the actions of a party with public or legal obligations. This is considered to an unethical form of practicing business and can have legal repercussions. Firm that want to operate legally should instruct employees to not involve themselves or the company in such activities. Companies should avoid doing business in countries where unstable forms of government exist as it could bring unfair advantages against domestic business and/or harm the social fabric of the citizens.\\n\\n==Factors towards globalization==\\nThere has been growth in [[globalization]] in recent decades due to the following factors.\\n\\n{{List incomplete|date=November 2018}}\\n\\n*[[Technology]] is expanding, especially in [[transportation]] and [[communications]].\\n*[[Governments]] are removing international business restrictions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\\n*[[Institutions]] provide services to ease the conduct of international business.\\n*[[Consumer]]s want to know about [[Foreign trade|foreign]] [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[service (economics)|services]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\\n*[[Competition]] has become more global.\\n*[[Political]] relationships have improved among some major [[economic]] powers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\\n*[[Countries]] cooperate more on transnational issues.\\n*[[Cross-national cooperation and agreements]] have increased.\\n\\n==Importance of international business education==\\n* Most companies are either international companies or [[Competition (economics)|compete]] with other international companies.\\n* Modes of [[Business operations|operation]] may differ from those used domestically.\\n* The best way of conducting business may differ by [[country]].\\n* An understanding helps one make better [[career]] decisions.\\n* An understanding helps one decide what [[Government policy|governmental policies]] to support.\\n\\nManagers in international business must understand [[social science]] disciplines and how they affect different functional business fields.\\n\\nTo maintain and achieve successful business operations in foreign nations, persons must understand how variations in culture and traditions across nations affect business practices. This idea is known as [[cultural literacy]]. Without knowledge of a host country's culture, corporate strategizing is more difficult and error-prone when entering foreign markets compared with the home country's market and culture. This can create a "blind spot" during the decision making process and result in [[ethnocentrism]]. Education about international business introduces the student to new concepts that can be applicable in international strategy in topics such as marketing and operations.\\n\\n===Importance of language and cultural studies===\\n\\nA considerable advantage in international business is gained through the knowledge and use of language, thereby mitigating a [[language barrier]]. A study by Lohmann (2011) in ''Economics Letters'' delved into the impact of language barriers on trade. The findings suggest that fluency in the local language can significantly enhance trade interactions.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lohmann |first=Johannes |date=2011-02-01 |title=Do language barriers affect trade? |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176510003617 |journal=Economics Letters |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=159–162 |doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2010.10.023 |issn=0165-1765}}</ref> Advantages of being an international businessperson who is [[Fluency|fluent]] in the [[local language]] include the following:\\n*Having the ability to directly communicate with employees and customers\\n*Understanding the manner of speaking within business in the local area to improve overall [[productivity]]\\n*Gaining respect of customers and employees from speaking with them in their native tongue\\n\\nIn many cases, it plays a crucial role. It is truly impossible to gain an understanding of a culture's buying habits without first taking the time to understand the culture.  Examples of the benefit of understanding local culture include the following:\\n*Being able to provide marketing techniques that are specifically tailored to the local market\\n*Knowing how other businesses operate and what might or might not be social taboos \\n*Understanding the time structure of an area.  Some societies are more focused on timeliness ("[[Punctuality|being on time]]") while others focus on doing business at "[[Business hours|the right time]]".\\n*Associating with people who do not know several languages.\\n*Language barriers can affect transaction costs. ''[[Linguistic distance]]'' is defined as the amount of variation one language has from another. For example, French, and Spanish are both languages derived from Latin. When evaluating dialogue in these languages, you will discover many similarities. However, languages such as English and Chinese or English and Arabic vary much more strongly and contain far fewer similarities. The [[writing system]]s of these languages are also different. The larger the linguistic distance there, the wider language barriers to cross. These differences can reflect on transaction costs and make foreign business operations more expensive.\\n\\n===Importance of studying international business===\\n\\nThe international business standards focus on the following:\\n*raising awareness of the inter-relatedness of one country's political policies and economic practices on another;\\n*learning to improve international business relations through appropriate communication strategies;\\n*understanding the global business environment—that is, the interconnections of cultural, political, legal, economic, and ethical systems;\\n*exploring basic concepts underlying [[international finance]], [[management]], [[marketing]], and trade relations; and\\n*identifying forms of business [[ownership]] and international business opportunities.\\nBy focusing on these, students will gain a better understanding of [[Political economy]]. These are tools that would help future business people bridge the economic and political gap between countries.\\n\\nThere is an increasing amount of demand for business people with an education in international business. A survey conducted by Thomas Patrick from [[University of Notre Dame]] concluded that [[bachelor's degree]] and [[master's degree]] holders felt that the training received through education were very practical in the working environment. Increasingly, companies are sourcing their human resource requirement globally. For example, at [[Sony|Sony Corporation]], only fifty percent of its employees are Japanese.<ref>{{Cite book|title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS|author=ASWATHAPPA|year=2003 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9781259051166}}</ref> Business people with an education in international business also had a significantly higher chance of being sent abroad to work under the international operations of a firm.\\n\\nThe following table provides descriptions of [[higher education]] in international business and its benefits.\\n{| class="wikitable"\\n|-\\n!  !!

Flipgigs is an online talent based student services marketplace connecting savvy consumers and businesses with an affordable network of talented , motivated, scrappy students from High Schools and Colleges who are eager to take on part-time jobs and gigs. \\n\\nFlipgigs was founded in the Spring of 2011 by Jayati Sengupta. According to Angel Investor Ron Conway, the most thought-provoking sector to develop in 2012 is the proliferation of peer-to-peer markets and the emergence of “collaborative consumption”. The age of so-lo-mo explosion has made it easier to share anything from resources to skills to assets and services.We are seeing a big shift in human relationships in the aftermath of web success in Facebook and LinkedIn era and I think this is just the beginning. A social platform like Flipgigs has the potential to very powerful. While everything else seems to be plummeting in today's tough economic times, one thing that continues to rise is the sticker price of college education. Moreover, with the stock market slump, the vast majority of parents are finding it extremely tough to dip into their dwindling retirement savings . Also, the student loan bubble is another bomb waiting to explode just like the housing mortgage crisis. That is where talent comes in. We already know students are very connected, resourceful and talented. We need a platform like Flipgigs to tap into this talent and have them find gigs easily. Students today need to start to wear a PIY attitude.(pay-it yourself)
As a person, I am an undergraduate linguistics researcher.  My languages of interest include: English, Italian, Emiliano-Romagnolo, and Persian.  My subjects of interest are Phonology, Phonotactics, Dialectology, Romance Ling, Historical Ling, Computational Ling, Lexicostatistics, and Cognitive Ling.\\n<br />\\nAs a Wikipedian, I am primarily interested in editing pages associated with languages and linguistics.  Linguistics, like other academic fields, contains individuals with many passionate opinions on the nature and theory of language.  Wikipedia should not be a soapbox for the advocacy of a particular theory.  However, I think it is important to present all existing theories so that people can make up their minds for themselves.  It becomes tedious and cluttery in Wikipedia to present every theory on a topic with its own list of pros and cons, however sometimes it is important to understand the line of reasoning in which a theory is discredited in the gradual evolution of scientific knowledge.\\n<br />\\nWikipedia has become the symbol of the 21st century age of information.  In milliseconds a vast medium of free information is available to everyone.  I want to contribute to wikipedia and participate in its gradual expansion.
Currently I am making contributions for several reasons: I want to practice my writing skills and request comment and feedback from other contributors as a means of improving my writing. I have read through Wikipedia's guidelines about quality and find it nearly impossible to digest all of it. Instead, small steps with criticism might be more productive. Secondly, I am interested in how the English speaking world has acted, reacted, and interacted with other parts of the world. My recent contributions focus on an Indian guru,  a newspaper editor, British colonial officials, a Togolese writer, and a Dutch-Indonesian writer.  I explore how these interactions shape and re-shape the English language. I see them as contributions to the most studied language in the world. Finally, I need to become more competent with the technical dimensions of writing, such as citing reliable sources, notability criteria, references and so forth. One of the most challenging things about Wikipedia is the opportunity to expand the notability criteria.
Low-cost terminal\\n\\nThis term is usually applied to a terminal building at an airport, which offers only the most basic features associated with terminals. The advantage of this lies in rapid construction, simplicity in design, and across the range cheaper operating costs. \\n\\nTypical features of a low-cost terminal include:\\n\\n* Simple design \\n* Modularity - all internal functions are designed with future expansion in mind\\n* No air bridges - passengers either walk directly from the building to the departing aircraft, or are bussed to a remote stand\\n* Low development and operating costs - the operator of such a terminal usually aims to attract airlines by offering significantly lower costs to prospective tenants\\n* \\n\\nThese terminals have usually been born out of the demands from [[low-cost carrier]]s, who typically wish to turn around their aircraft in the shortest possible time.remote gates have proven to be the most efficient way of boarding and deplaning passengers.
I'm fascinated by [[energy]], both in the sense that the word is used in science and as it is applied in everyday life.\\nThe Wikipedia definition describes various ''forms'' of energy, but no-one seems to know what energy per se actually is. As I understand it, energy can't be created or destroyed, but it can change form, and matter is just one of these forms. This tells me that the energy I'm made of has always existed, and is the reason for my Wikipedia username.\\nMy own level of physical and mental energy varies from time to time, depending on the state of my health, what I eat and drink, the weather, what's happening around me and a host of other factors. \\nEnergy also drives civilisation and the global economy, which is why I believe climate change and peak oil are the biggest issues facing humanity.\\nBy the way, if anyone can tell me exactly what energy is, or explain that climate change or peak oil aren't worth worrying about, I'd be most grateful!
{{Userspace draft|Aeolian processes on Mars|date=April 2010}}\\nSand dunes have been observed throughout the surface of the planet Mars.  Movement of these dunes has been theorized and inferred from the lack of craters on dunes.  Dune movement has not yet been directly imaged, however.  Understanding sand movement processes is vital to a correct Martian climate model, as well as the safety of future missions to Mars.\\n\\n==Introduction==\\nOn Earth, sand is a very plentiful resource.  Wind, water and ice, as well as chemical reactions and biological activity, all serve to break apart rocks and other solid material into sand on a large scale.  While much of this sand is quickly stabilized by biological and hydrological processes, and converted into sedimentary rock, some of it, especially in desert climates where these influences are minimal, remains in the form of unconsolidated sand and dust for thousands of years or more, subject to influence by the wind.    \\nSand is an especially interesting material to study because of its granular nature.  When acted upon by wind, sand behaves in ways that, at first glance, seem peculiar.  Instead of being deposited evenly along a surface, sand self-accumulates into ripples, drifts, and dunes.  It can be piled high, but can only sustain slopes up to the material's angle of repose for the local gravitational force, beyond which the pile will undergo gravitational collapse.\\n\\nSand dunes cover an estimated 5,000,000 km2 of Earth’s surface (more than half the area of the United States), mostly in desert climes and along shorelines (Hayward et al., 2007).  Where surface sand dominates, it can present a serious hazard to machinery when made airborne.  For example, sand storms famously foiled President Jimmy Carter's attempt to rescue American hostages being held in Iran in 1980.  Granules of sand and dust are so small that they can sneak through microscopic gaps into the workings of complex machinery, causing serious malfunctions and short-circuits.  The abrasive action of airborne sand can damage or destroy structures and equipment alike.  Unchecked, dunes can cover and rend useless vitually anything downwind: roads, machinery, even entire settlements (Hayward et al., 2007; Jones, 2001).\\n\\nIt has been apparent that dunes exist on Mars since 1971, when Mariner 9 imaged the first extraterrestrial dune fields (Iverson, 1976).  Observations of extensive dune fields across the Red Planet in 1972, as well as the absence of any substantial liquid water or geological activity on the present Martian surface, make it clear that aeolian processes are indeed the dominant geomorphic forces which are shaping present-day Mars (Phillips, 1998).\\nThe United States’ “Vision for Space Exploration” includes stipulations for future exploration of Mars by both unmanned probes and crewed missions (Bush, 2004).  With a clear goal of establishing the presence of complicated machinery, where great expenditures and potentially the lives of astronauts will be at stake, it is absolutely essential to understand the mechanics of aeolian processes as they take place on Mars.  An essential part of this understanding would be determining the activity of the current Martian surface.\\n\\nDespite several successful lander and rover missions to Mars in the past few decades, as well as a steady improvement in the resolution of images taken from orbit, there is still no hard evidence of dune movement anywhere on present-day Mars (Williams, 2006).  This study sought to use available imagery from Mars orbiters and Opportunity rover to search for any dune movement.  The analysis concluded that saltation is likely occurring during the most severe storms on present day Mars, and that one saltation event likely occurred as recent as July, 2007.  However, no conclusive evidence for dune movement on present-day Mars was found.\\n\\n==Background==\\n\\n===The nature of sand on Earth===\\nDeserts cover approximately 20% of Earth’s surface, and sand covers 20% of Earth’s deserts (Watson, 1997).  Sand is created by the erosion of rock containing quartz, feldspar, or other hard minerals, as well as the erosion of coral and volcanic glass.  It is mainly found near seashores, where it is created by wave action, along rivers, where rocks frequently collide in strong currents, and in deserts, where it is created by aeolian processes.\\n\\nIt seems natural, when dealing with a problem of sand movement, to first define exactly what sand is.  Sand is a subset of all granular materials.  Granular materials can be as large as boulders, and can be as small as 1 µm (the scale where thermal vibration effects become significant).  Sand can be defined as any granular material which can be influenced by fluid flow, however, this definition must be restricted one degree further by putting a limit on the diameter of the material’s individual grains.  The need for this restriction is clear; while both a fine powder and a heap of boulders fit neatly into the granular material definition, they behave quite unlike traditional sand under a fluid in motion. A powder will be dispersed quite quickly and suspended under the action of a typical wind, while larger rocks will be entirely unaffected, disregarding abrasive erosion.\\n\\nThe definition of sand used by Bagnold is a very good general one for the purpose of dune study (Bagnold, 1941).  A lower limit for sand grain size can be found by investigating the behavior of a fluid flowing over a granular surface.  In natural situations, fluid flow is very rarely fully laminar; it will contain eddies, or “gusts”, which represent a local increase in wind speed and change in direction.  Some of these eddies will be in an upward direction, giving the potential for small particles to be suspended.  However, nearer to the ground, the upward and downward components of the eddies are weaker than other directions. While the intensity of these upward gusts is variable, it is commonly approximated as 20% of the mean wind velocity (Alghamdi and Akyurt, 2001).  Therefore, any particle with a terminal velocity lower than 0.2 times the mean wind velocity will be carried up and suspended indefinitely, provided the wind keeps up. Any particle which can achieve this suspension is defined as dust.\\n\\nAn upper limit for sand grain size is even easier to define.  Sand moves through two modes of transport: saltation and surface creep.  There is an additional mode, reptation, which is the minor saltation of sand grains physically dislodged by impacting particles, which typically do not have the energy to dislodge further grains (Lancaster, 1995; Parteli, 2007).  However, as is apparent by the definition, reptation is merely a subset of saltation, and so shall be included within this category.\\n\\nSaltation is the process where by sand grains actually become airborne, while surface creep is sand movement by which the grains never actually leave the ground.  At some upper limit, however, the combination of wind pressure and sand impact are no longer sufficient to move a grain of sufficient size.  Grains which remain stationary even in the most intense wind are defined as pebbles.  Therefore, any granular material which does not fall under the definition of dust or pebbles is sand.\\n\\nNatural sand never consists of uniformly-sized grains.  There will always be some natural variation in the size of sand grains, even those formed from the same rock and by the same process.  The distribution of sand grain sizes is known as the grading of the sand.\\n\\n===Nature of sand movement===\\nFluid-based sand transport takes place close to the planetary surface, within what is known as the boundary layer; the layer of wind above the ground where surface friction affects the local wind velocity.  Within the boundary layer, wind tends to vary logarithmically by height, defined by Equation 1.  \\n\\n	 	1\\n\\nThe terms used in this equation will be defined later, however there is an important term to point out now: u*, which is known as the shear velocity.  The shear velocity is not an actual velocity, but a mathematical parameter of a wind profile with units of velocity.  The shear velocity is constant for a given wind profile, so it is considered more convenient, in discussions of sand movement and other near-surface processes, to refer to boundary layer winds in terms of shear velocity rather than actual velocity.  \\n\\nA single grain can be moved in a variety of ways.  It can be moved as part of a sand avalanche on a slip face or it can be knocked forward along the ground (or even into the air) by an impacting airborne grain.  When analyzing the initiation of sand movement, however, it is necessary to study the case where a sand grain is moved by the direct pressure of the wind.\\n\\nA sand sheet is obviously stable under a fluid with no velocity.  At very low velocities, friction between individual grains in the sand sheet keeps them from moving.  However, as wind velocity increases, eventually drag and lift forces overcome the forces of friction and gravity keeping the sand grains in place, and the most exposed sand grains will become airborne (Lancaster, 1995).\\n\\nA grain lifted in this manner will likely have a small initial velocity in relation to the mean wind velocity at its initial height.  Therefore, the faster wind will impart some of its momentum upon this grain, possibly reaching an equilibrium, where the grain is moving at the local wind speed.  However, the airborne state of the sand particle is short-lived.  When the particle impacts the sand bed, it transfers its momentum, usually into several sand grains.  In this way, even grains not exposed enough or too large to be moved by the fluid threshold shear velocity may be dislodged and set in motion, which initiates a type of sand movement known as saltation.  Saltation is a mode of sand movement involving short jumps by individual particles, and is the process by which approximately 75% of sand movement occurs (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\nWhen the grain impacts the sand bed, it creates a splash, which is the propulsion of multiple sand grains at the impact site into the wind stream.  If the wind remains constant at or above u*ft, the flux of saltating grains q will initially increase exponentially as more and more grains are impacted and driven into the wind stream.  Since each additional saltating grain draws more momentum from the wind, the wind speed in the saltation layer decreases.  Eventually, the system reaches an equilibrium airborne grain density, where the force of the wind lifts as many grains as it possibly can into saltation.\\n\\nIn addition to increasing the number of grains in saltation, impacting grains also serve to initiate another type of sand movement, known as surface creep.  Even though grains that are a bit too large to saltate by direct wind pressure can be dislodged by impacting grains, other grains are too large to become airborne even when given this extra boost of momentum.  However, if these grains are not too large, they may be knocked forward along the sand surface without ever becoming airborne.  This is the process of surface creep:  descending grains impact other larger grains, moving them forward slightly before friction stops them.\\n\\nOnce saltation has been initiated, the main producer of saltating particles is the impact of other saltating particles on the sand bed.  A peculiar consequence of this property is that after the initiation of saltation, the shear velocity may drop below u*ft, and saltation will still continue.  At this point, the fluid threshold shear velocity becomes unimportant, and a new, lower threshold comes to light.  It is only when the shear velocity drops below this new level, the impact threshold shear velocity (u*t), that saltation will cease.\\n\\nThe aforementioned saturation of the boundary layer is not an instantaneous process.  For any given grain distribution and wind speed, there is a lag between the time saltation is initiated and when the maximum grain density is reached.  The saturation length is the distance a parcel of fluid moves before achieving the maximum grain density (Bagnold, 1941).  It also represents a rough measure of the distance it takes for a change in one property of the wind flow to reform into a new velocity profile according to Equation 1.\\n\\nSand movement, taken on the level of individual grains, is understandably chaotic.  A single wind-blown grain impacting the surface can knock multiple grains into random trajectories.  However, taking the average paths of individual saltating grains gives the characteristic path for a given sand and wind.  The length of this path is the saltation length, Ls, an important parameter in many sand transport models, as well as in the formation of ripples, which will be described later (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\nThe velocity distribution of the wind in the boundary layer is roughly logarithmic by height, as can be seen in Equation 1.  However, the level at which the velocity actually drops to zero is slightly above the actual ground level.  In fact, for different values of shear velocity over the same surface, the wind speed drops to zero at the same height.  This term, z0, is known as the surface roughness, which will be explained later.  It changes greatly between different types of terrain, and is dependant mainly on the degree of sand movement and dominant grain size.\\n\\n==Physics of sand movement==\\nSand, a granular material, has some properties of a fluid, some properties of a solid, and some of neither.  As such, it requires unique equations to describe its behavior, particularly when under the influence of a flowing fluid.\\n\\nSome of the first equations to accurately predict the movement of sand and sand formations were formulated by Ralph A. Bagnold.  His book, Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes, was the first comprehensive study on all forms of sand transport.  It is still used actively many decades later, and may still be the best work on the physics of sand dunes.  Many of his original equations will be useful in this analysis.\\nWithin the planetary boundary layer, mean wind velocity u varies logarithmically with height z according to the relation shown here\\n\\n	 	1\\n\\nwhere κ = 0.40 is the von Kármán constant (AMS, 2000), u* is the wind shear velocity, and z0 is the surface roughness. The terms u∗ and z0 are independent variables which may be determined experimentally.  The von Kármán constant does not depend on atmospheric properties; it is an experimentally derived universal constant.  It should be noted that z0 is not an actual measure of surface roughness, but an apparent measure, which will be explained later.\\n\\nWith the wind velocity distribution known, it is natural to investigate what strength of wind is needed to initiate sand movement.  Individual sand grains are rough, irregular chunks of material, varying widely from the theoretical spherical shape.  Therefore, as Bagnold pointed out, it is convenient to find a scaling factor for determining the diameter of a sphere of equivalent composition as the non-spherical sand grains which will behave identically under the influence of a fluid.  This shape factor is dependant largely upon the amount of weathering that the sand has undergone, as well as the average grading of the sand.  It must often be determined experimentally; for desert sand on Earth, 0.75 is a good approximation. (Bagnold, 1941)  Multiplying the actual average diameter of sand grains by the shape factor yields the apparent grain diameter, which will be used from here on in place of the actual grain diameter.\\n\\nThere are actually two forces imparted upon an exposed sand grain by the wind. (Parteli, 2007)  The first, a drag force, is due to the friction of the moving air on the grain, and is in the direction of the fluid flow.  It is described by the equation\\n\\n	 	2\\n\\nwhere d is the diameter of the particle, σ is its density, β is a constant which depends on the packing of the grains, and u* is the shear velocity.  The second force, the lift force, is\\n\\n	 	3\\n\\nwhere Δp is the difference in pressure from the bottom to the top of the grain.  On the scale of sand grains, due to the strong velocity gradient near the surface, the lift force is very significant.  On Earth, it is approximately equal to 85% of the magnitude of the drag force. \\n\\nAt the initiation of sand movement, the drag and lift forces work to rotate the grain over some pivot point p.  These forces are resisted by the grain’s weight, which is \\n\\n	 	4\\n\\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid and g is the planetary gravitational constant.  Thus, with a momentum balance, it is easily possible to find the threshold parameters for grain movement.  \\n\\nThe forces balance over a pivot point p seen on the right.  Therefore, when (5) is true, \\n\\n	 	5\\n\\nthe saltation process begins (Parteli, 2007).\\n\\nThere are several important parameters which govern sand movement, as well as two important thresholds which indicate when movement will begin.  Under unchanging topographic conditions, the shear velocity is defined by another important quantity, the shear stress, τf according to the relation\\n\\n	           	6\\n\\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid.  The shear stress is merely a measure of the drag force per unit surface area.\\nAs the shear velocity increases, the drag force and lift force increase as well.  The value of u* where the inequality shown in (5) is true is called the fluid threshold shear velocity (u*ft).  An equation for u*ft is \\n\\n	 	7\\n\\nwhere A is the Shields parameter.  The Shields parameter has been determined experimentally in the past, and is relatively constant on Earth.  Under low atmospheric pressure, however, the Shields parameter has a complex dependence upon the grain diameter and wind velocity.\\n\\nAt the fluid threshold, the most exposed sand grains begin to be entrained in the fluid.  Because the velocity of the wind works parallel to the surface, the motion of the grain is temporary; soon, any upward motion of the grain is checked by the grain’s weight, and the grain impacts the sand bed some distance downstream (Bagnold, 1941).\\nAs mentioned above, the additional momentum imparted to grains on impact allows grains of larger sizes to enter saltation.  Thus after the initiation of saltation the impact threshold shear velocity (u*t) becomes the more important parameter.  It is typically near 80% of the value of u*ft (Parteli, 2007).  \\n\\nIf dune movement is indeed occurring, then an important factor to know is the sand flux q, or the weight of sand transported per second.  Here is where Bagnold’s work becomes insufficient, as his sand flux equations are fairly accurate, but do not predict the existence of a threshold velocity.  A universal sand flux equation, which has been confirmed by both wind tunnel and field experiments, here shown as Equation 8 (White, 1979; Lancaster, 1995).\\n\\n	 	8\\n\\nThe problem, then, for determining the existence of dune movement on Mars through calculation, lies in the knowledge of several key features of the local Martian surface.  Indeed, it is very possible that there are places on Mars where saltation still occurs, and others where aeolian features are “petrified”, no longer influenced by the prevailing winds.\\n\\n==Dune formation and movement==\\n\\n===Small-scale sandforms===\\nSand under the influence of wind can be found in many different formations, dependant upon many factors, including grain size, average shear velocity, sand availability, and the presence of obstacles.  Sandform is a generic term for any sandy deposit or formation.\\n\\nThe simplest sandform is one found in the wake of an immobile object, such as an exposed rock, known as a sand shadow (Bagnold, 1941).  Sand shadows are formed by deposition of sand in saltation due to localized reduction of shear velocity in the wind shadow of such an immobile object.  \\n\\nBehind any object within a fluid flow, there is a surface of discontinuity, outside of which the flow is roughly laminar near the mean wind speed, but inside of which is turbulent, with a mean velocity lower than the mean wind speed.  The reason that sand, not dust, is deposited in these areas is a direct consequence of the definition of sand we are using here.  While sand is highly influenced by the wind, it will tend to follow a uniform trajectory rather than a changing streamline in the wind.  So a grain flying over or around an object while in saltation may, by chance, fall into the wind shadow behind the object, where it will likely stay.  A dust grain in suspension, however, will tend to follow the changing streamlines and fly past the wind shadow.\\n\\nIn addition to sand deposits found in the wake, any obstacle will also have a small pile in front of it, due to yet another wind shadow in front.\\n \\nFigure 3: Wind flow around a surface object.  Sand will tend to accumulate in the wind shadow, where the wind is turbulent with a lower average speed\\n\\nA related sand formation is a sand drift, which forms in gaps between objects and in wind shadows caused by changes in terrain.  \\n\\nSand shadows and drifts require the presence of obstacles to alter the boundary layer fluid flow.  However, one of the most interesting properties of sand is that a flat sand sheet is unstable under a fluid flow.  The mechanism for this peculiar property becomes apparent when you analyze the case of saltation over a flat sheet of sand.  \\nTake the simplifying case of a flat sheet of sand undergoing a uniform barrage of saltating grains.  In addition to there being a characteristic path to describe the average path of saltating grains, it turns out that all grains descend at a very uniform angle of descent.  Because of this, the descending grains can be represented by parallel vectors, as in Figure 4.  \\n\\nA “flat” sand sheet can not be perfectly flat, as it consists of finite grains of roughly circular proportions.  As such, at any moment there exists a multitude of minuscule pits and discontinuities.  Figure 4 shows just such a deformation, where a small depression has formed momentarily due to a few saltating grains being removed.  Because of the near-uniform descent angle of grains in saltation, the existence of the depression causes more sand grains to impact in the downwind slope of the crater than the upwind slope.\\n\\nThe sand flux due to surface creep, qc, is proportional to the number of impacts per surface area.  Therefore, the downwind side of the temporary depression is suddenly subjected to a much higher sand flux.  Since there are now more grains moving out of the depression than into it, a continuous saltation will serve to deepen the depression and extend it downwind.\\n\\nWhen the sand surface begins to deviate from the ideal flat sand sheet case, the ideal situation seen in Figure 4 with an even distribution of descending grains at a constant angle no longer applies.  Knowing that saltating grains have a characteristic path, a grain leaving the sand bed at some point will tend to land very near to a point one saltation length downwind.  Therefore, if an area has a much higher sand flux due to increased saltation impacts, the same will apply for an area one saltation length downwind.  In this way, a single chance depression will soon become an extended area of sand ripples.  These sand ripples have a very regular wavelength which is dependent upon the prevailing wind speed, and is remains constant over time as long as the wind speed remains constant.\\n\\nThe shape and height of these ripples depends on the surface sand grading, or the distribution of sand grain size.  This can be deduced by a simple analysis of growing ripples:  as the height of each ripple increases, the average velocity at the grains will increase according to the boundary-layer wind distribution (Equation 1).  If the range of grain sizes in a particular sand bed is small, the higher wind speed at the top of ripples will tend to topple the grains at the crest into the next trough.  Therefore a narrower range of grain sizes will result in smaller ripples.  A wider range of grain sizes will allow for larger ripples.\\n\\nAs seen previously, an area of increased grain impacts will also see an increase in the grains moved by surface creep.  Therefore, if a significant portion of the grains in the sand bed can only move by surface creep, a different kind of sand formation will be seen.  In this case, after the initiation of saltation, the smaller grains are slowly removed until the larger grains begin to dominate.  Ripple-like formations will still emerge, but they will have essential differences.  Larger grains only capable of surface creep will begin collecting at each crest, creating a wind shadow for the subsequent trough similar to that in Figure 4.  Since the larger grains are moved much slower than the smaller grains, and cannot move in their own shadow due to a lack of saltation, the collection at each crest grows larger, as shown in Figure 5.  These features are known as ridges.\\n\\nAt some point, assuming uniform conditions throughout the sand bed, the ridges will grow large enough to shelter the troughs completely, halting saltation, and creating a stable configuration of small, steep-faced ripples.  However, a more common case is one where there is an oncoming saltation from upstream.  In this scenario, the surface creep will continue to build the ridges higher.  With higher ridges, the wind shadows grow longer, and subsequently the wavelength increases.  If saltation conditions prevail for long periods, ridges can grow indefinitely.  So unlike ripples, the wavelength of ridges does not depend on the mean wind velocity.\\n \\nFigure 5:  A typical ridge.  The line AC represents the wind shadow where no saltation or surface creep is taking place, the line DA is the area of maximum surface creep, and the line AB is where creeping grains from the crest are avalanching down the downwind slope.  From Bagnold, 1941.\\n\\nThere is a third feature, known as a megaripple, which can form under the same conditions as normal ripples.  They are widely spaced, less regular in their repetition than normal ripples.  It is unknown whether their wavelengths are dependant upon grain distribution or properties of the local wind regime.  Little is known about their genesis or evolution, and many consider them to be dunes rather than ripples or ridges, but they have been widely observed on the surface of Mars. \\n\\nOne important feature distinguishes ripples and ridges from other sand forms.  In ripples and ridges, the coarsest grains appear at the crests, with finer grains in the troughs.  The opposite is true for so-called large-scale sand formations, the majority of which are true sand dunes.\\n\\n===Dune formation===\\nThe genesis of dunes has actually been observed only rarely in any detail (Lancaster 1995).  Only a few studies have documented properties of dunes from formation until maturity, and these only noted the physical transformation of the dune, not the sand properties believed to be important in dune genesis.  The accepted theory regarding dune formation comes mainly from the study of mature dunes and wind tunnel scenarios, so there is an inherent uncertainty in the exact processes which take place.\\n\\nContrary to popular belief, a sandy desert floor on Earth is rarely composed entirely of sand.  A typical desert floor is either composed of a sandy surface interspersed with pebbles and a few larger boulders, or what is known as a desert pavement, where all surface sand and dust have been removed, leaving a layer of interlocking pebbles.\\nThe desert pavement case is irrelevant for our purposes.  In other areas, large pebbles among smaller sand grains will tend to space themselves out evenly, regardless of their initial distribution.  Because of this, the presence of pebbles tends to stabilize a sand sheet, halting saltation by raising z0, the level at which average wind velocity drops to zero.  However, if a sand sheet stabilized by pebbles is subjected to a stronger wind, more sand may be removed, until another equilibrium level is reached where the sand grains are sheltered by the pebbles.\\n\\nA sandy area with large pebbles can sustain a much higher sand flux than a bare sand sheet.  This is due to the tendency of saltating grains to rebound higher and longer when impacting an immobile object such as a pebble.  So when a patch of bare sand forms by deposition or other processes, the tendency will be for upwind saltation to deposit sand on an existing sand patch.  However, a pebbly surface will have a much higher surface roughness than a surface of bare sand, and so the fluid threshold shear velocity will be much higher as well.  So if the shear velocity is not much higher than u*ft for the pebbly surface (a “gentle” wind), the sand patch will be stretched downwind and dispersed.\\n\\nIn the case of a shear velocity much higher than both fluid thresholds (around 4×u*ft, a “strong” wind), saltation will begin in earnest before the wind reaches the sand patch.  At the upwind edge of the sand patch, saltation increases violently, causing substantial drag which causes a reduction in the wind velocity at and just upwind of the bare sand patch, which in turn results in a net deposition of sand.  In this way, a strong wind will serve to increase the thickness of a sand patch, as well as extend it upwind. The same process has been shown to occur in areas where the surface roughness changes more gradually, due to a change in the sand grading.\\n\\nIn order for dunes to form in these areas of changing surface roughness, four conditions must be satisfied.  First, wind which causes saltation along the smoother sand surface must not blow for too long, lest it dissipate the sand accumulation entirely.  Second, for the duration that the strong wind blows, there must be a consistent supply of sand from upstream, or else the smoother sand patch will quickly dissipate in much the same manner.  Third, there must not be a large amount of grains in surface creep, as these grains will tend to encroach upon the smoother patch of sand, preventing dune growth.  Fourth and lastly, the smoother sand must be at least as long as the saturation length, as there will be varying instances of removal and deposition as the new wind profile adjusts.  This saturation length, usually between 4 and 6 meters on earth, represents a lower limit for the size of true sand dunes.\\n\\nThere are two mechanisms by which upwind saltation could be sustained.  The first case we will consider is a unidirectional wind profile, where both strong and gentle winds blow in the same direction (±15º) (Lancaster, 1995).\\nIn a unidirectional wind regime, any sand patches will have no mechanism by which to become wider, and may only extend in the downwind direction.  This leads to the appearance of sand strips, which are arranged parallel to the prevailing wind.  Unless the wind is much higher than the sand’s threshold shear velocity, these sand strips will soon thin out to the point where buried pebbles start to reemerge, in addition to encroaching grains in surface creep.  However, if a period of strong winds occurs, an interesting self-sustaining wind regime may form close to the surface.  The intense saltation ongoing over the sand strips saturates the boundary layer, slowing the near-surface wind velocity significantly.  \\n\\nThe intervening areas between strips are pebbly, and under a gentle wind the higher surface roughness dictates that the near-surface wind velocity will be lower than over the sand strip.  This situation changes in the above case of a very strong wind.  While there may or may not be saltation over the pebbly surface, the density of saltating grains will be less, assuming the wind is not so strong that this area is saturated as well.  This creates alternating streams of slower and faster wind, which tends to create small eddies and vortices, the sum of which is a convergent wind pattern on the sand strips.  This process can be seen in Figure 7.  If the strong wind can be sustained for a long enough time, these sand strips may eventually build into longitudinal dunes, which are arranged parallel to the wind flow.\\n\\nThe second case, where gentle winds blow in a different direction than the stronger winds, is much simpler.  If an isolated sand patch is created, a strong wind will build it up, at the expense of a now-denuded area just downwind.  If gentle winds occur, just barely above the saltation threshold, from a different direction, they will thin out the accumulated pile slightly, but also replenish the denuded area with a fresh layer of sand.  This regime tends to create oblique dunes or transverse dunes, depending on the magnitude of the direction difference.  Oblique dunes are arranged at an angle to the direction of dune propagation, while transverse dunes are perpendicular to the direction of dune propagation.  Regardless of which case occurs, a continuation of strong winds will build a budding dune steadily up to a certain point.  However, when the dune reaches a size where it begins to alter the nearby wind profile, it no longer needs a strong wind to sustain it.  \\n\\nWhen a dune first forms, a cross-section taken parallel to the dune-building wind typically takes a shape similar to the one shown in Figure 8.  Because of the projection of the dune up into the wind stream, the dune significantly alters the wind profile.  Closer streamlines on the upwind or stoss side of the dune show areas of higher wind velocity, indicative of a net positive sand flux, or sand removal.  On the downwind or lee side of the dune, the streamlines spread apart, showing an area of net negative sand flux, or sand deposition.  In this way, a dune can move essentially unaltered across a desert floor, even if the wind is only strong enough to move the bare sand on the dune.\\n \\nFigure 8:  New dune altering the wind profile above itself.  The streamlines appear closer together on the stoss side of the developing dune, and further apart on the lee side, so sand is removed from the front of the dune and deposited downwind, causing dune movement.\\n\\nA sand dune can not remain in this uniform, hill-like profile for long.  Equation 9 gives the sand flux on a simple hill-shaped dune undergoing no net flux (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\n	 	9\\n\\nwhere x is the horizontal distance from the upwind foot of the dune, c is the velocity of the dune, ρs is the density of the sand in bulk (including air between grains), and α is the inclination of the dune surface at point x.  Therefore, all other factors being equal, the both the net removal and deposition of sand will occur at the point where the slope is the steepest, shown in Figure 8.  With an unequal sand flux, different areas of the dune will begin to advance at different rates, leading to an oversteepening of the lee slope as seen in Figure 9.\\n\\nWhen sand is piled on itself, like any granular material, it can only support itself against the force of gravity to a certain point.  Because of frictional and inter-grain cohesive forces, a sand pile can achieve a fairly large angle, typically around 34º for sand on Earth.  Any slope steeper than this angle will collapse, avalanching until the slope below this critical angle, known as the angle of repose.  In the case of a moving dune, sand avalanching in this manner will eventually morph the lee slope into a fairly straight slope just shallower than the angle of repose.  This straight slope is known as a slip face, and is always roughly transverse to the direction of winds above the saltation threshold.\\n\\nWith the formation of the slip face, the lee of the dune now contains a wind shadow, with a surface of discontinuity roughly equal to the surface of the ideal “sand hill” shown in Figure 8.  The wind shadow will serve to increase deposition even further at the foot of the dune, causing dunes with slip faces to continue to grow.  The dune has now reached maturity, and will continue to evolve and migrate as long as there is a consistent wind above the saltation threshold.  \\n\\n===Dune types===\\nThe exact evolution of the dune beyond its initial formation depends upon two factors:  the amount of sand available for saltation outside of the dune, and the wind regime complexity.  The previous descriptions of dunes as, longitudinal, oblique, or transverse refers only to the arrangement of individual dunes in a group in reference to the prevailing wind regime.  These terms have little or no bearing on the actual dune type.  There are three major types of dunes, each of which represents different local conditions, and, most importantly, all of which are found on Mars (Lancaster, 1995).\\n\\nThe first dune type, arguably the easiest to recognize, is the barchan dune.  Barchans form in areas of limited sand availability and unidirectional wind regimes.  The stoss side of the dune is relatively featureless and dome-shaped.  The slip face is curved, resembling a bite which has been taken out of a dome-shaped dune, terminating with two horns extending downwind, one on each side of the dune.\\n\\nNow, the curved slip face is not an indication of changing wind directions.  It is a consequence of the change in sand-wind interaction as the dune grows.  A larger dune begins to interrupt the linear fluid flow, causing it to curve slightly around both sides of the dune.  Since the local wind speed is the most important factor in determining the slip-face orientation, this slight curvature of the horizontal wind profile causes the slip-face to become curved (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\nFigure 10 shows a very neat example of a Martian barchan dune.  This dune exists near 41.4°S 44.6°E, on the western rim of Hellas Basin, the largest impact crater on Mars, and is part of a chain of barchans not seen to the lower left and upper right.  In this image, by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE imager, all the classic barchan features are visible.  The curved, crescent-shaped slip face is prominently featured in the center, dissipating into two “horns” downwind.  The remainder of the dome-shaped dune is covered in sand ripples, which tend to form on barchans due to their unidirectional wind environment.  The dune-forming wind is from ENE-to-WSW, and the ground outside of the dune is a jumbled bedrock terrain, distributed with small sand deposits, suggesting very limited sand availability.  The dune is about 120 m long from stoss foot to horn tip, with the horn-to-horn distance of about 40 m, fairly typical of large barchans found on Earth.\\n\\nThe barchan is one type of the larger group of crescentic dunes, all of which are formed under unidirectional wind regimes.  Another type of crescentic dunes is very closely related, crescentic ridges (not actual ridges, but a type of dune).  Crescentic ridges resemble parallel chains of barchan dunes which tend to overlap.  Logically, crescentic ridges form in areas where sand availability is higher than with pure barchans, but the wind regime is still unidirectional (Lancaster, 1995).  \\n\\nOn earth, the most common type of dune is the linear dune.  However, on Mars, linear dunes only appear to be dominant in about 5% of large dune fields (Hayward et al., 2007).  Linear dunes appear when there are two dominant sand-moving directions, separated by more than 15º. (Lancaster, 1995)  The slip face is not fixed with respect to a linear dune, but shifts from one side of the crest to the other as the wind regime changes.  A related dune type which has also been found on Mars is the reversing dune, which is formed by a wind regime which periodically changes direction close to 180º.\\n\\nAn even more complicated wind regime, featuring three or more prominent wind directions, results in the formation of star dunes.  These can be the largest dunes, building to several hundred meters high on Earth.  These dunes have multiple slip faces, which are active and inactive depending on the current direction of the wind.  On Mars, they are often found on the floor of smaller craters such as Victoria Crater.\\n\\n==Expected nature of sand-surface interaction on Mars==\\n\\n===Martian weather and climate===\\nMars has long been theorized to have an active atmosphere, possessing many of the familiar transient atmospheric characteristics which we on Earth call “weather”.  As early as 1877, Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli observed what he thought were “clouds” in the Martian sky (Parteli, 2007).  While it is almost certain that what he observed were dust storms which cover the surface of Mars every year or so, it began the race to determine just how “alive” the Martian atmosphere currently is.\\n\\nMariner 9 offered the first up-close look at the planet and its atmosphere in 1971.  Imagery at Mariner 9’s arrival indicated that Mars was in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm, obscuring the surface to the point that the striking polar ice caps were not even visible (Parteli, 2007).\\n\\nAfter a few weeks, the dust storm cleared, allowing for the first clear, high-resolution images of the Martian surface.  These images clearly showed large expanses of dune fields on all corners of the planet.  This spurred theories of an active atmosphere with ongoing sand movement.\\n\\nFive years later, the Viking landers reached the surface of Mars, taking the first direct measurements of wind speed in an extraterrestrial environment.  They measured a mean wind speed which rarely exceeded 10 m/s, which corresponds to a wind shear velocity of approximately 0.8 m/s, assuming several theoretical values are correct (Moore, 1985).  These wind measurements were only taken at one height (1.6 m), so the typical wind profile on Mars could still only be estimated.\\n\\nThere were several significant dust storms during the Viking missions, each of which was associated with a peak in wind speeds to 20 m/s or more.  In at least one case, the wind reached 40-50 m/s (wind shear velocity 3-4 m/s) for a period of around 40 seconds at the Viking 1 lander, causing the first observed saltation event on Mars.\\n\\nThe Pathfinder rover, Sojourner, contained instruments to gather this missing data.  The Pathfinder landing site (19.33 N, 33.55 W) was not far from the Viking 1 site (22.697° N latitude and 48.222° W longitude), and in an area of similar surface composition (Sullivan, 2002).  Sojourner  featured a meteorological boom with three wind socks, which was to help fill in the missing data.  Unfortunately for the meteorological goals of the mission (although probably fortunately for the mission in general), the weather was calm for the entire 83 Martian-day mission, with the wind never climbing above 10 m/s at the 1 meter elevation, and no observed sand or dust movement (Sullivan et al., 2000; Sullivan 2002).  There was enough data to estimate a fluid threshold shear velocity of 4.5 m/s, much higher than the numerically and experimentally predicted value of 2.0-2.5 m/s, likely due to the abundance of boulders and large rocks (Sullivan, 2002).\\n\\nThus it is expected that the average weather on Mars is relatively calm.  However, during dust storms, it appears that winds above the saltation threshold can occur, and have occurred in the past.  These planet-wide dust storms occur almost every year in the Martian northern-hemisphere autumn, and likely happen with such repetition because the atmospheric pressure is highest at that time (Larsen et al., 2002).\\n\\nTemperature at the surface has only a minor influence on saltation, aside from possibly preventing it in the case where water or CO2 frost accumulates.  Temperature has been found to vary widely with season, latitude, and time of day, just as on Earth, but typically is in the range of 180-260 K (-135ºF to 10ºF) in the summer and 160-200 K (-170ºF to -100ºF) in the winter.\\n\\n===Global distribution of sand dunes and sheets on Mars===\\nAlthough aeolian processes are ubiquitous on Mars, large-scale sand sheets/seas, dune fields and ergs are not as extensive on Mars as on Earth.  A recent estimate of the coverage of large-scale sand features (dune fields and sand sheets) on Mars is on the order of 800,000 km2, or about 1% of the Martian surface surveyed in that study (Hayward et al., 2007).  On Earth, large-scale sand features cover approximately 5,000,000 km2, and while this is 1.0% of the Earth’s total surface area, it is 3.4% of Earth’s land area.\\n\\nOn Mars, dunes are found almost exclusively within craters and Valles Marineris, the 4000 km-long canyon system near the planet’s equator.  While on Earth most dunes are linear in nature, on Mars a vast majority of dunes are crescentic, with a smaller amount being linear (Hayward et al., 2007).  Large dune fields feature very few star dunes; however, smaller dune fields in medium-sized craters almost universally have a star-like appearance.\\n\\nAs aeolian processes seem to be the only active geological processes on Mars, aside from impact craters and very localized water action, the lower concentration of dunes compared to Earth suggests that there is less sand available for saltation, either because winds above the saltation threshold are less prevalent or there is less total sand on Mars.  Indeed, it may be a combination of the two.  The main source of erosion which produces sand-sized particles on Earth is oceans and other hydrological processes; these are obviously absent from present-day Mars.  On top of that, evidence for present-day winds above the saltation threshold is very sparse.  Prior to the landing of the Mars Exploration Rovers, there has only been one verified instance of indirectly observed saltation on Mars, during the (Viking 1) Martian Dust Storm of Sol 1742 (Moore, 1985).\\n\\n===Properties of the surface and atmosphere at Meridiani Planum===\\nWhile the initial scope of this study was a planet-wide search for dune movement, eventually the search for directly-observed movement of sand moved to Meridiani Planum, in the area around Victoria Crater, where Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has been aggressively imaging the landscape.  \\n\\nWind data is sparse for the Martian surface.  Only three landers have succeeded in making wind measurements, and only the two Viking landers have a data set more than a few months long.  However, these data sets agreed that the shear velocity rarely exceeds 1.0 m/s, and only dust storms contain winds strong enough to produce saltation. This is much lower than u*ft, which is estimated to be approximately 2.0 m/s at Meridiani Planum (Sullivan et al., 2005).\\nFor the area of Meridiani Planum, as with most of the surface of Mars, the sand is composed of basaltic sandstone.   The grains are approximately 50-150µm in diameter, topped by a scattering of pebbles as large as a few millimeters.  The density of grains has been estimated as approximately 3200 kg/m3 (Sullivan et al., 2005).\\n\\nLike Earth, the wind is rarely dead calm on Mars.  This is apparent from wind speed measurements by both Viking landers and Sojourner rover, which were typically less than 10 m/s (22 mph), but were rarely dead calm.  At Meridiani Planum, prevailing winds during apparently calm weather gradually removed dust from Opportunity’s solar panels over a period of 50 Martian days in the summer of 2006.\\n\\n===Expectations for sand dune movement on Mars===\\nMany studies have attempted to find conclusive evidence of sand movement on Mars.  It is apparent that dunes are either migrating very slowly now, or have migrated in the recent past.  There are two main bodies of evidence which support this:  first, there are very few known impact craters on dunes, and second, most Martian dunes appear crisp, with well-defined slip faces.  Studies have estimated that, if sand movement does occur, it is at a rate of 1-8 cm per year at most (Fenton, 2006).\\n\\nDune fields at Rabe Crater (44 ºS, 35ºE) and Proctor Crater (48ºS, 30ºE) have shown strong evidence for dune movement.  Images of Rabe Crater dunes show alternating dark and light streaks on the dunes’ slip faces which change even over the course of a single Martian year, which have been interpreted as saltation-induced grainflows (Fenton, 2006).  Images of Proctor Crater dunes indicate possible slip face reversing on barchanoid dunes (Fenton et al., 2005).  There is even a suggestion in this study that one slip face moved as much as 37 m, however, no study has yet succeeded in directly imaging a large-scale change in dune positions, which would confirm dune migration.\\n\\n==Observation techniques==\\n\\n===History of early observations of Mars===\\nMars is a prominent visible feature in the night sky.  At its closest approach to Earth, it is the 4th brightest object in the night sky, and one of the only visible objects to be bright red.  As such, it has been observed since man first gazed upward, and was recorded by many ancient civilizations as a star signifying war or death.  Until the 17th century, however, it was merely a mote of red light, varying in brightness over the period of a few years.\\n\\nThe first observations of recognizable features on the planet’s surface are attributable to Christiaan Huygens, who sketched a dark plain now known as Syrtis Major, as well as the bright southern polar ice cap, in 1672.  In the same year, Giovanni Domenico Cassini observed a transit of a small star by Mars, and concluded that it must have a very thick atmosphere; although it turned out that his observations were flawed, this was the first “evidence” of a dynamic Martian atmosphere.  In the early 18th century, Giacomo Filippo Maraldi drew what he thought were clouds stretched across the planet, though these turned out to be permanent features of the planets surface which are still visible today.  He also described changes he observed in the southern ice cap, and suggested that the properties of the surface there changed somehow from year to year (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nIn 1783, William Herschel observed another Martian transit and concluded that Cassini’s observations of a very thick Martian atmosphere were false.  However, he also observed what he called “occasional changes of partial bright belts”, concluding they were storm clouds above the planet.  As the few clouds known to exist on Mars are not visible even today from Earth, Herschel likely was observing local dust storms.  In the 1820s and 1830s, Johann Heinrich Mädler and Wilhelm Beer made many contributions to the study of Mars, conclusively proving that the previously observed dark patches were permanent surface features, and determining the planet’s rotational period to within a few seconds.  In 1837 they observed that Mars was nearly featureless save the ice caps, possibly indicating the first observation of a planet-wide dust storm.  In 1864, Rev. William Rutter Dawes improved greatly upon Mädler and Beer’s observations, making drawings depicting almost every major albedo feature identified today (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nAt this point, there was little more that could be learned from earth-bound telescopes, given the limitations imposed by atmospheric aberrations.  In fact, further refinement of observations, more often than not, were completely wrong.  In the 1870’s, Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli first made the infamous claims of canali, Italian for “canals” or “channels”, on the surface of Mars.  As it turned out, the “channels” were either illusions due to optical effects, or simply imagined features (Sheehan, 1996).  Until the 1960s, the prominent theory was that the dark albedo features on Mars were swaths of vegetation, and the ice caps were seasonal patches of water-ice (Sheehan, 1996).  There were observations of yellow clouds, thought to be dust storms, and white clouds, thought to be analogous to earthbound clouds.  There was even a scientific consensus that many dark features were blue in color (Sagan and Kellogg 1963).\\n\\nHowever, there were some doubters to the scientific consensus.  Some theorized a desert-like planet with large dune fields and no vegetation.  As early as the 1950s the idea of a Martian surface dominated by sand dunes was proposed (Gifford, 1964).  A few scientists also doubted the existence of the canali as anything more than mere optical illusions.\\n\\n===Observations from Martian probes===\\nThose doubters were proven right by the observations of Mariner 4 in 1965.  Sending spacecraft to Mars was no small task—several probes launched by both Russia and the United States failed to reach Mars successfully in early 1963 and mid-1965.  Mariner 4 performed the first successful fly-by of Mars in July, 1965.  It was only able to take 22 discontinuous, low-resolution, blurry images, but they were sufficient to reveal that the traditional view of Mars’s atmosphere was quite wrong.  The images taken by the television camera revealed an old, dry, cratered surface, with no canals, no vegetation, and no evidence of life whatsoever.  Indeed, it looked closer in appearance to the moon than to Earth.  To further disprove the contemporary theories, atmospheric measurements indicated that the surface pressure was at most a few millibars, and was composed almost entirely of carbon dioxide (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nIt was at this time that the idea of dust storms as the main form of weather on the planet first rose to prominence.  It was the only plausible explanation for the seasonal changes in albedo features, with the idea of liquid water and vegetation now all but debunked.  The images were not nearly detailed enough to image sand dunes, however, it was widely believed that the atmospheric dust was lifted by surface sand movement and saltation impacts (Goody, 1969).\\n\\nThe next probes sent to Mars, Mariner 6 and Mariner 7, would add detail to the planets surface (high-resolution imagery of about 10% of the planet’s surface), and confirm the atmospheric measurements made by Mariner 4.  By chance, they photographed no dust storms or dune fields, especially because only a few dozen images from these two probes were of high enough resolution.  However, they did capture images of frost in craters, as well as confirm that the ice caps were likely CO2 ice (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nThe next successful mission, Mariner 9, was also the first successful Mars orbiter.  In fall of 1971, it began returning images of a planet completely devoid of surface features.  After shutting down for a month to conserve power, it began returning images rich in detail, including craters, valleys, and, most importantly, sand dunes.  Mariner 9 was able to image most of the surface down to a resolution of 100 meters or so.  \\n\\nSince then, the resolution of images sent back from Mars has steadily improved.  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Viking orbiters imaged much of the planet down to a resolution of 40-90 meters, with many areas of interest imaged as well as 10-meter resolution.  The next Mars orbiter, the Mars Global Surveyor, arrived almost 20 years later in 1997.  It’s Mars Orbiter Camera imaged about 70% of the planet to better than 7-meter resolution in almost 10 years orbiting Mars.  Finally, the current Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera is imaging areas of interest with a resolution of 25-50 centimeters.\\n\\n11.	References\\n*Alghamdi, A. A. A. and Akyurt, M.

\\n<big>DATA BSE</big>\\n                       A database is an organized collection of data for one or more purposes, usually in digital form. The data are typically organized to model relevant aspects of reality (for example, the availability of rooms in hotels), in a way that supports processes requiring this information (for example, finding a hotel with vacancies). This definition is very general, and is independent of the technology used.\\nThe term "database" may be narrowed to specify particular aspects of organized collection of data and may refer to the logical database, to physical database as data content incomputer data storage or to many other database sub-definitions.\\nThe term database is correctly applied to the data and their supporting data structures, and not to the database management system (referred to by the acronym DBMS). The database data collection with DBMS is called a database system.\\nThe term database system implies that the data is managed to some level of quality (measured in terms of accuracy, availability, usability, and resilience) and this in turn often implies the use of a general-purpose database management system (DBMS).[1] A general-purpose DBMS is typically a complex software system that meets many usage requirements, and the databases that it maintains are often large and complex. The utilization of databases is now spread to such a wide degree that virtually every technology and product relies on databases and DBMSs for its development and commercialization, or even may have such embedded in it. Also, organizations and companies, from small to large, heavily depend on databases for their operations.
The Mumbai terrorist attacks struck India's tourism industry but it will be resilient and bounce back as it did post-September 2001. The present crisis presents an opportunity. There was an even bigger crisis in Indian tourism in 2001-02. The attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, war in Afghanistan, withdrawal of flights, attack on Parliament House in New Delhi and troop mobilisation on the India-Pakistan border meant that Indian hotels had just 20-25 per cent occupancy. International tour operators had removed India from their sale brochures and inbound Indian tour operators had switched to outbound operations.

As outsourcing of Logistics / SCM operations become more popular for firms, the management of risk will gain more importance. Variables such as fluctuating exchange rates, supply disruptions due to labor strikes and supplier bankruptcy may cause havoc on the supply chain. Implementing a solid risk management strategy will help reduce uncertainties.
I am a neurologist and ALS Researcher. One of the reasons I have become involved with Wikipedia is that my patients often come to me with articles downloaded from the Internet – often well sourced from Wikipedia! This is one of the fantastic ways that medicine has moved on from the bad old days of paternalism – now patients (or clients) are up to date, want to know more and are keen to become involved in research. \\n\\nBut some information out there (all over the Internet) is misleading, misrepresentative and gives false hope to terminally ill patients.... and even worse, sometimes a vulnerable section of people are exploited.  \\n\\nMy hope is to see that the neurology research on Wikipedia continues to be well-written, peer-reviewed and a reliable source of information for those who need it most.

'''<big>BLAST INJURIES</big>'''\\n\\n\\n'''WHY ARE BLAST INJURIES AN IMPORTANT ISSUE RIGHT NOW?'''\\n\\nAmerica's armed forces are sustaining attacks from explosions or blast by rocket-propelled grenades, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and land mines almost daily in deployed settings. Civilian workers and military personnel working in these combat zones are at increased risk of blast-related trauma, particularly blast-related traumatic brain injury (TBI). \\n\\nSome of the TBI and concussive injuries associated with significant blast may not be identified acutely for several reasons. Initially, the blast-related TBI or concussion may have occur simultaneously with other more obvious life threatening injuries. Initially, the focus of medical care providers must be on the most life threatening injuries. Sometimes, in the case of a concussion/mild TBI (mTBI) resulting from blast, there may be no outward sign of injury; service members may also be reluctant to endorse acute symptoms because they do not want to be medically evacuated and separated from their unit. Because blast exposure is so common in the combat zones and almost everyone has had some of the acute symptoms of concussion, it may not be identified as problematic until the service member returns home from the deployment. \\n\\nFinally, concussions and TBI related to significant blast exposure are also likely to have other important co-morbid conditions present. For example, the patient may also have combat stress or depression associated with a return from deployment; it is very challenging for the medical providers in these situations to determine what symptoms are due to the concussion and which symptoms are due to the combat stress or depression. \\n\\n'''HOW DOES BLAST EXPOSURE CAUSE A CONCUSSION OR A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY?'''\\n\\nA TBI is caused by a blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the function of the brain. Exposure to blast events can affect the body in a number of ways; in addition, these different injuries mechanisms can interact and result in more impairments or prolonged periods of recovery.\\nPrimary blast injury is the result of exposure to the over pressurization wave or the complex pressure wave that is generated by the blast itself. This blast over-pressurization wave travels at a high velocity and is affected by the surrounding environment; for example, the effects of the blast wave may be increased in a closed environment such as a vehicle. Air-filled organs such as the ear, lung, and gastrointestinal tract and organs surrounded by fluid-filled cavities such as the brain and spinal cord are especially susceptible to primary blast injury (Elsayed, 1997; Mayorga, 1997). The over pressurization wave dissipates quickly, causing the greatest risk of injury to those closest to the explosion.\\nSecondary blast injury is the result of energized fragments flying through the air; these fragments may cause penetrating brain injury.\\nTertiary blast injury may occur when the individual is thrown from the blast into a solid object such as a adjacent wall or even a steering wheel. These types of injuries are associated with acceleration/ deceleration forces and blunt force trauma to the brain similar to that observed following high speed motor vehicle accidents.\\nFinally, quaternary blast injury can occur in the presence of severe blast related trauma resulting from significant blood loss associated with traumatic amputations or even from inhalation of toxic gases resulting from the explosion.\\nIn summary, TBI resulting from blast exposure can be much more complex compared to TBI from other causes. As such, it is challenging to differentiate blast related TBI and/or concussion from other conditions. Finally, it is also difficult to estimate the course of recovery in these cases, as it may vary widely depending on various types of blast injury and other injury variables, such as the size of the blast, distance from the blast, etc. Because of these issues, it may be difficult to assess blast related TBI and concussion in the same manner that other brain injuries are examined. A better approach may be to conduct an evaluation based on the mechanism (cause) of the injury; that is, screen all individual service members exposed to a blast for any symptoms which might be resulting from the effects of blast on the brain. \\n\\n'''WHAT SYMPTOMS MAY INDICATE A BLAST RELATED BRAIN INJURY?'''\\n\\nDifficulties experienced as a result of a closed brain blast injury may include a range of physical, emotional, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Many of these symptoms are non-specific, however; that is they occur with other conditions such as depression or combat stress. It requires an experience clinician who is familiar with the many variables involved in blast injury and has an understanding of how these variables can affect recovery and ultimately impact return to everyday activities.\\n\\n'''WHAT IS DVBIC DOING TO CARE FOR THOSE WITH BLAST INJURIES?'''\\n\\nDVBIC works to identify all service members who have sustained a closed brain injury during combat operations and to ensure that they receive the best care available. \\n\\nBecause the effects of blast injury on the brain are still being discovered, DVBIC has led the way in developing a number of important research projects examining specific variables involved in the blast. In addition, DVBIC has been involved in studies on developing combat gear which will better protect the brain should a blast occur. \\n\\nFinally, DVBIC has been involved in the validation of several important diagnostic tests for better identifying the blast effects on the brain; these include the use of advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as Diffuse Tensor-weighted Imaging (DTI) and advanced technologies for measuring the function of the brain as the individual works on specific tasks; this technique is known as Magnetoencephalography (MEG).\\n\\n<ref>{{cite web|title=BLAST INJURIES|url=http://www.dvbic.org/TBI---The-Military/Blast-Injuries.aspx|publisher=http://www.dvbic.org|accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref>

== J2ME ==\\n\\nJ2ME made its debut at the JavaOne Developers Conference in mid-1999 and is targeted\\nto developers of intelligent wireless devices and small computing devices who need to\\nincorporate cross-platform functionality in their products.\\nConsumers of mobile and small computing devices have high performance\\nexpectations for these devices. They demand quick response time, compatibility with\\ncompanion services, and full-featured applications in a small computing device.\\nConsumers expect the same software and capabilities found on their desktop and laptop\\ncomputers to be available on their cell phones and personal digital assistants.\\nTo meet these expectations, developers have to rethink the way they build computer\\nsystems. Developers need to harness the power of existing front-end and back-end\\nsoftware found on business computers and transfer this power onto small, mobile, and\\nwireless computing devices. J2ME enables this transformation to occur with minimal\\nmodifications, assuming that applications are scalable in design so that an application\\ncan be custom-fitted to resources available on a small computing device.\\nDevelopers seeking to build applications that run on cell phones, personal digital\\nassistants, and various consumer and industrial appliances must strike a balance between\\na thick client and a thin client. A thick client is front-end software that contains the logic\\nto handle a sizable amount of data processing for the system. A thin client is front-end software that depends on back-end software for much of the system processing.
'''Background'''\\n\\nNowadays, the problems of climate changing and global warming become more and more serious, numbers of countries have implemented carbon taxes or energy taxes that are related to carbon dioxide emission in order to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and thereby reduce the speed of global warming. In Europe, numbers countries, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Italy, Switzerland, and the UK have imposed energy taxes based on carbon content. More surprisingly, in the most powerful manufacturers’ country, China Daily (2010) stated that the Chinese government has proposed to introduce a carbon tax from 2012 or 2013. According to Australian government (2011), Australia is one of the top carbon dioxide emission countries which produce 500million tones of carbon pollution each year. \\nA carbon tax is also called as a price instrument, since it sets a price for carbon dioxide emissions. In economic aspect, the carbon dioxide pollution is considered as negative externality, a negative effect on a party not directly involved in a transaction, which results in a market failure. A tax on a negative externality is called a Pigovian tax which should be equal to marginal damage costs. \\nAustralian carbon tax is a tax on energy sources which charging based on the amount of emission level. It can be implemented by taxing the burning of fossil fuels. The carbon tax involved in producing a product would start to be factored into its final price. Moreover, Australia government plans to use the tax income to investing clean energy. In the future, the carbon tax will simulate the pollution-intensive companies to use other clean production processes in order to reduce their emission and lower their costs.\\n\\n'''Impact on mining'''\\n\\nWhile the Australian Government sees great benefit from the carbon tax, in the mining community, a very different view exists. Unsustainable increases in operating costs could lead to the closure of many mines and thus mass job losses, while businesses which rely on the mining of resources such as airlines could be forced to use cheaper alternatives, thus reducing the required output from these mines. \\nThe introduction of the tax would ‘hinder Australian mining’s ability to operate in the world market’ (Mineral council of Australia 2011). It is estimated that by 2020 the Australian mining industry will have paid between 18 - 25 billion dollars in tax, meaning that Australia’s industry will be at a disadvantage in the world market. This common concern amongst the Australian mining industry is highlighted by the fact that in Europe 73% of all mining exporters are subsidised by the government while only 16% would be in Australia under the carbon tax. The mining industry in Australia already has to compete with mining industries overseas, namely Indonesia, Columbia and China. These countries have significantly cheaper operating costs than Australia ($34 to lift one tone of coal opposed to $42 in Australia), mainly due to the substandard working conditions that exist in these countries. \\n\\nThe Australian Coal Association’s chairman, John Pegler, believes that 17% of all black coal mines in Australia will close putting ‘at risk more than 21000 jobs in the next ten years’ as a consequence of the carbon tax. The ‘economic deadweight cost’ (Marius Kloppers, BHP Billiton’s CEO 2011) will be too large for the smaller mining companies to absorb, forcing the closure of these mines. This ultimately could mean that a monopoly will begin to exist within the mining industry, with larger companies such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto becoming the only mining operators in Australia.\\n\\n'''Political impact'''\\n\\nThe carbon tax has received heavy criticism from opposing parties. One of the major criticisms of the proposed plan is that it will increase inflation. Treasury modelling suggests that household cost will increase by an average of $9.90 per week as a result of the tax. This is because polluters are expected to pass on the cost to consumers. The demand for services such as electricity is said to be relatively inelastic. This means that there aren’t any good substitutes for this service which in turn allows firms to increases prices freely. Therefore, the tax could essentially become politically unsustainable.  Since the tax is linked to the production of goods and services such as electricity, which the consumer cannot live without, there will be constant political pressure on the government to remove the tax. \\n\\nThe labour government is convinced that the carbon tax will work successfully in achieving its aims of lowering greenhouse gases and promoting green energy. The government believes in the concept of climate change, which was a contributing factor towards their decision of developing of this policy. Australian’s are the highest per capita polluters in the developed world, so it does make sense that Australia should join the ranks of other countries such as France and Denmark in introducing a carbon tax. However, the question remains as to weather such a tax will reduce pollution. There are no guarantees that emissions will decline if consumption of the goods and services that produce carbon emissions remains unresponsive to price increases. \\n\\nThe liberal government knows that climate change has not been proven, and that studies are still sketchy. Therefore, their approach has been to adopt the stance of not believing in climate change and going against the carbon tax policy. This could be a clever tactic if the policy is proven to be ineffective after its implementation. \\nThe carbon tax has without a doubt been a huge talking point within Australia and its potential success is crucial to the survival of the labor government.
== salt water crockdile ==\\n\\nSaltwater crocodiles are extremely dangerous animals, but data on attacks are limited outside of Australia, and estimates of human fatalities vary wildly between dozens to thousands annually. It is likely that, given this species' low population within most of its non-Australian / New Guinean range, the number of attacks is probably within the lower range of estimates. Most attacks by adult "salties" are fatal, given the animals' size and strength. In Australia, attacks are rare and usually make headlines when they do occur. There are, on average, no more than one or two fatal attacks reported per year in the country.[25] The low level of attacks is most likely due to the extensive effort by local wildlife officials to post crocodile warning signs at nearly every billabong, river, lake and even at some beaches and also due to the relatively well-informed nature of the local citizens. In the Aboriginal community of Arnhem Land, which occupies roughly half of the top end of the Northern Territory, attacks may go unreported and may be more common. There have also been recent, less-publicized attacks in Borneo,[26] Sumatra,[27] eastern India,[28] and in Myanmar.[29]\\nthere are two types of crockadile a fresh one and a salt water one.\\n\\n== chembackolie ==\\n\\nchemabackolie is in ammrica and the wheather is monsoon sun
Farmland Flooding in Northeast South Dakota (Brown County)\\n\\nThe weekend of May 5-6, 2007 brought heavy rainfall throughout South Dakota.  Northeast of Aberdeen, Columbia, SD received nine inches of precipitation in one shot.\\nMuch of this area was in need of rain, with the previous summer’s near drought conditions.  (June and July 2006 had less than an inch of rain in the same area.)  The heavy rains caused flooding throughout the county.  There were flooded basements, closed (flooded) roads, and school delays because of the heavy rains.  This also caused many problems for area farmers.  Some crops that had already been planted were now washed away or flooded out.  Replanted crops face maturity problems because of fall frost.  Even though most would never frown upon rain, it has created new problems and challenges to face.  \\n\\n[[User:Caradennert|Cara Dennert]] 23:20, 24 June 2007 (UTC)
'''Non Deliverable Forwards:'''''[[Italic text]]''\\n\\nThe standard FX transaction was designed to facilitate the exchange of notional currencies for the purpose of cross-border commerce.  The standard FX forward transaction allows for parties to the transaction to agree a rate of exchange days, weeks, months or even years in advance of the actual transaction occurring.  The use of these transactions has evolved from its original purpose.  FX transactions are commonly used to hedge exposure to exchange rate risk.  An example of such use would be a manufacturing company making a product in Europe and selling the product in the United States.  Such an organisation would have expenditure (plant, machinery, salary etc.) in Euros and revenue (from the sales of its product) in US Dollars.  If the value of the Euro against the US Dollar increases, the cost base, relative to revenues, would increase, resulting in less profit.  Conversely, the company would become more profitable if the value of the US Dollar increased against the Euro.  To hedge against fluctuations in the exchange rate, the company might enter into a forward FX contract to sell US Dollars against Euros at the end of its fiscal year.  If the value of the Euro increased against the US Dollar, the core business of the company would be less profitable.  However, the value of the FX contract would increase and the profit from this transaction would offset the reduction in profitability.\\n\\nThis hedging strategy works well if currency exchange between the two counties is unrestricted.  However, when exchange controls are in place, the strategy becomes less effective.  This is particularly true in countries where the exchange controls either forbid, or heavily penalise large cross-border cash transfers.  The Non-Deliverable Forward transaction was designed to overcome some of the problems of exchange controls by eliminating the need for cross-border cash transfers without eliminating the risk profile (and hence the hedge effectiveness) of the transaction.
 Light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength that is visible to the eye (visible light) or, in a technical or scientific context, electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength. The elementary particle that defines light is the photon. The three basic dimensions of light (i.e., all electromagnetic radiation) are:\\n\\nIntensity (or amplitude), which is related to the human perception of brightness of the light, \\nFrequency (or wavelength), perceived by humans as the color of the light, and \\nPolarization (or angle of vibration), which is only weakly perceptible by humans under ordinary circumstances. \\nDue to the wave-particle duality of matter, light simultaneously exhibits properties of both waves and particles. The precise nature of light is one of the key questions of modern physics.
Sustainable Cleaning\\n\\nIn the 1980’s the United Nations created a commission title the UN Decade for Education for Sustainable Development in response to a growing realization of the need to balance economic and social progress with the concerns for the environment.  The Commission defined sustainable development in the publication as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. \\n\\n\\nPeople and corporations need to be responsible and do the right thing when it comes to protecting our earth.  There are many factors that can help contribute to sustainability, but the one discussed here is chemicals.  Each year, millions of tons of carcinogens are washed down drains.  Harsh chemicals in cleaning products often contain chemicals that have adverse effects on the environment.  In addition to negative effects on the environment, chemical cleaning products also have health effects on those that work with them on a daily basis or are exposed to them in the workplace.  \\n\\n\\n"Green chemicals" started to show up in the marketplace in the late 1980's.  However, during the introduction stages of these types of products, many companies purchased these chemicals at premium prices only to learn that they did not work.  Recently with improvements in technology and a better understanding of customer needs, several companies have began to develop cleaning products that work, are priced right, and are better for the environment and human health.  Today, many businesses are beginning to use sustainable cleaning chemicals to clean their facilities.  Employees, workers, and customers were demanding it.  But, with so many products out there to choose from, how do you know which ones to pick?\\n\\n\\nWhile Green Seal and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Design for the Environment (DfE) program are a good benchmark, they should not be the only consideration if you are selecting green cleaning products.  One item that may be helpful to remember that certifications are based on a process that can take a long time to complete.  Therefore, while these certifications are relevant, they may not be the most up-to-date source of information in "green" chemicals.  Some other helpful tips might include reviewing the ingredients in the product.  Are they made from naturally derived ingredients like sugar, surfactants, citrus, milk and soybeans?  Natural ingredients in products are effective cleaners and are more sustainable for human health and the environment.  Another tip is looking at the company supplying the product.  What is their commitment to Sustainability and how long have they been manufacturing the product?\\n\\n\\nAn innovator in this space is a company called Coastwide Laboratories, a regional distributor located in the Pacific Northwest.  Coastwide began looking into this area in the early 1980's.  Chief Science Officer, Roger McFadden reviewed several products and found various harmful ingredients such as volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde, and carcinogens in the products.  McFadden recognized the danger in these chemicals and developed the Sustainable Cleaning Product Design Standard (SEGC-114) in which all products developed by the manufacturer must comply with.  In addition, the company developed a “green gatekeeper” policy that made sure that cleaning chemicals that they distribute also meet their sustainability requirements.  \\n\\n\\nMcFadden developed the Sustainable Earth® product line is 2003.  This development marks the first time a performance-driven product also complied with SEGC-114, Green Seal, and DfE requirements.  In July 2007, Sustainable Earth® became available to a national audience and made the product available to businesses everywhere in the U.S.\\n\\n[[User:Niccol9132|Niccol9132]] 14:41, 16 July 2007 (UTC)
== assassin ==\\n\\na murderer, one who kills a person for fanatical,financial or monetary reasons.\\n\\n\\n:history:\\n\\nActive in Persia and Syria from the 8th to 14th centuries, the original Assassins were members of the Nizaris, a Muslim group who opposed the Abbasid caliphate with threats of sudden assassination by their secret agents. Other populations of the area regarded the Nizaris as unorthodox outcasts, and from this attitude came one of the names for the group, ḥaššāšīn, a word originally meaning "hashish users," which had become a general term of abuse. Reliable sources offer no evidence of hashish use by Nizari agents, but sensationalistic stories of murderous, drug-crazed ḥaššāšīn or Assassins were widely repeated in Europe. Marco Polo tells a tale of how young Assassins were given a potion and made to yearn for paradise—their reward for dying in action—by being given a life of pleasure. As the legends spread, the word ḥaššāšīn passed through French or Italian and appeared in English as assassin in the 16th century, already with meanings like "treacherous killer."\\n\\n:modern assassins:\\n\\n\\nIt is clear that assassins have taken a new shape today, using silenced guns, or the cliché knife. But, this idea of assassins derived long before video games and modern depictions. It derived in a time when it was necessary for survival. It was in fact a well-utilized tool to save their country from utter destruction.

Deforestation : Africa’s deforestation rate is twice that of the world’s. 90% of Africa’s population requires wood to use as fuel for heating and cooking. The rate of illegal logging, which is another main cause of deforestation, varies from country to country, such as 50% in Cameroon and 80% in Liberia. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, deforestation is primarily caused by the needs of the poor, along with unsupervised logging and mining.\\nIn Ethiopia, the main cause is the country’s growing population, which induces an increase in agriculture, livestock production, and fuel wood. Low education and little government intervention also contributes to deforestation. Madagascar’s forest loss is partially caused by citizens using slash-and-burn techniques after independence from the French.\\nNigeria has the highest rate of deforestation of primary forests, according to the FAO. Deforestation in Nigeria is caused by logging, subsistence agriculture, and the collection of wood for fuel. \\nAccording to the FAO, deforestation has wiped out nearly 90% of Africa’s forest. West Africa only has 22.8% of its moist forests left, and 81% of Nigeria’s old-growth forests disappeared within 15 years. Deforestation also lowers the chance of rainfall; Ethiopia has experienced famine and droughts because of this. 98% of Ethiopia’s forests have disappeared over the last 50 years.\\nWithin 43 years, Kenya’s forest coverage decreased from about 10% to 1.7%. Deforestation in Madagascar has also led to desertification, soil loss, and water source degradation, resulting in the country’s inability to provide necessary resources for its growing population. In the last five years, Nigeria lost nearly half of its primary forests. Ethiopia’s government, along with organizations like Farm Africa, is starting to take steps to stop excessive deforestation <ref>{{cite web|title=Deforestation by Region|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_by_region|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>. \\n\\n2.

Oliver, British Columbia, is a small town located in the South Okanagan. Billing itself as the "Wine Capital of Canada," Oliver is renowned for its high quality wine. The climate and topography offer the optimum conditions necessary to grow the preferred Vinifera wine grapes and the town has the largest concentration of both vineyards and commercial wineries in British Columbia. Approximately 30 wineries are located within 15 minutes of Oliver. Many of these are located along what is known as the Golden Mile of Highway 97, just south of Oliver. The rolling terraces, exceptionally mild climate with lots of sun, gravelly soil and availability of irrigation produce the right elements for growing high-quality grapes, as well as cherries, peaches and other soft fruits.

The general assumption is that government owned external land is public space but with several exceptions such as military sites or government buildings that do not have a public function (such as the gardens of the White House or the lawns of the Pentagon). Space owned by private organisations such as churches, corporations or charities can offer public access to their space, but with rules that do not apply to state owned public space. graveyards, National Trust coast line and art galleries blur this distinction of not always being state owned, but can be treated in many respects as Public Space.\\n\\nThe time of day can also change the way Public Space may be used.

Sexual identity is associated with sex, gender, and sexual orientation. Sex is biologically and based on ones anatomy. Gender is the intergrated cognitive, social. And emotional schemes assosiciated with being male or female. Sexual orientation refers to ones preference for and attraction to sexually intimate partners. Sexual identity begins with the formation of gender identity in early childhood. (Newman). It involves applying the correct gender label and gender stability and consistancy. Sexual identity is later developed and formed during adolescence. Adolescence is a stage in which great identity (and sexual identity) confusion and exploration occurs. During adolescence we begin to apply and test the gender labels we have provided for ourselves. We do this through intimate and sexual relationships. During this stage, one can change their sexual orientation and identity.\\n\\nSexual orientation refers to ones preference and attraction to sexual partners. The terms used to describe sexual orientation includes, heterosexual (straight), homosexual (gay/lesbian), bisexual (attraction to both sexes), and asexual (no attraction to either sex). Once a person feels confident on their sexual orientation, has gender stability and consistence, that is when their sexual identity is formed.
'''Terrorism – A Global Issue'''\\n\\n----\\n\\n\\n\\nTerrorism is one of the most serious challenges the world faces today. It is war against democracy and crime against humanity. It has crossed national boundaries and has international ramifications. It is a new variant of genocide which threatens national unity and sovereignty. Terrorism in one way is a new threat to humanity in the 21st century. Terrorism is violence used by a few against fellow human beings. Terrorist have total disregard for human lives including their own. Violence is an essential part of terrorism. Terrorism is a systematic use of violence or the threat of violence to achieve specific political goals. It attempts to use violence to cause widespread panic, fear or terror to achieve its ultimate political aim. This fusion of crime and politics gives birth to terrorism. Terrorist use violence to demoralize the government and ultimately push them to a situation of counter violence. In this struggle it is the civilian population which suffers the most – physically, mentally and economically. Terrorism which is confined within the national boundary and is directed against one’s own government is called Insurgency.\\n\\nFew words are as politically or emotionally charged as terrorism. One 1988 study by the US Army found that over 100 definitions of the word "terrorism" have been used. Acts of terrorism are not intended to merely victimize or eliminate those who are killed, injured or taken hostage but rather to intimidate and influence the societies to which they belong. Modern terrorism has come to be defined in part by the influential power of the mass media that terrorists co-opt in their efforts to amplify and broadcast feelings of intense fear and anger. As a type of unconventional warfare, terrorism is designed to weaken or supplant existing political landscapes through capitulation or acquiescence as opposed to subversion or action. “Terrorist attacks" are usually characterized as "indiscriminate", "targeting of civilians" or executed "with disregard for human life". The term "terrorism" is often used to assert that the political violence of an enemy is immoral, wanton and unjustified. According to the most common definition of terrorism typically used by states, academics, counter-terrorism experts and non-governmental organizations, "terrorists" are actors who don't belong to any recognized armed forces or who don't adhere to the laws of war and who are, therefore, regarded as "rogue actors". Those who are accused of being "terrorists" rarely identify themselves as such and, instead, typically use terms that refer to their ideological or ethnic struggle, such as: separatist, freedom fighter, liberator, revolutionary, vigilante, militant, paramilitary, guerrilla, rebel, jihadi or mujaheddin, or fedayeen or any one of similar-meaning words in a number of languages. Terrorism has been used by a broad array of organizations to further their objectives. They including right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic and religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments. \\nTerrorism in the past was found in different places. Terrorism [terrorism] the threat or use of violence, often against the civilian population, to achieve political or social ends, to intimidate opponents, or to publicize grievances. The term dates from the Reign of Terror (1793-94) in the French Revolution but has taken on additional meaning in the 20th cent. Terrorism involves activities such as assassinations, bombings, random killings, and hijackings. Used for political, not military, purposes, and most typically by groups too weak to mount open assaults, it is a modern tool of the alienated, and its psychological impact on the public has increased because of extensive coverage by the media. Political terrorism also may be part of a government campaign to eliminate the opposition, as under Hitler, Mussolini , Stalin , and others, or may be part of a revolutionary effort to overthrow a regime. Terrorist attacks also are now a common tactic in guerrilla warfare. Governments find attacks by terrorist groups difficult to prevent; international agreements to tighten\\nIn the past few decades India has been badly affected by terrorist. Some hostile countries encourage fundamentalist forces, separatist tendencies and terrorism in India. As a result, secularism in India, which is built upon the principle of unity in diversity, gets adversely affected. Terrorism poses a direct threat to national sovereignty, territorial integrity and democracy in India. Some well known terrorist in India are People’s war group (PWG), Maoists communists centre (MCC) and the IKF. The world too has seen many terrorist in the past few years. The whole world has been shaken by the destruction caused by these terrorists. The major terrorist associations are Al-Qaeda and Taliban. Al-Qaeda was a association created by the great Taliban leader Osama Bin Ladein who ruthlessly caused the destruction of the World Trade Centre, Washington D.C on 9th September 2001.  He also crashed an airplane on the Pentagon, USA. \\n\\nAl-Qaeda or Al-Qaida is an armed Sunni Islamic organization with the stated objective of eliminating foreign influence in Muslim countries. The most prominent members of the group are adherents of Wahabism, an extreme, militant sect of Islam. While Osama Bin Ladein is generally recognized as the group’s leader, the group’s operations are not centralized, and many independent and collaborative cells exist in multiple countries linked by a common cause.\\nAs a matter of fact, all sectors are put to a stand still due to these terror strikes. The direct effect of these is seen in the sudden drop in the markets. The stock prices do drop down and the trading comes to a stand still, however the business seldom stops and the markets show their cushioning effect by regaining the vigor. But at times the loss of even trading day can be fatal to a country’s economy. Such attacks also incur a direct burden on the defense budget. It goes without saying that the governments do take desperate measures to minimize the losses and cover the country against the future threats. The new areas of defense research open up and thus fresh jobs are created. This brighter side of the attacks is over-shadowed by the loss of lives and panic that is created with in the country. The government, under such circumstances, looses the track of their priorities and the developmental works are sidelined. This causes damage to civic society. The worst hit by terrorist activities is the third world countries. The terrorists make these vulnerable counties their bases and from here carry out the destructive activities. Their influence in such countries shows and threatens the developed world of their power and dominance. Thus such countries make an appropriate guinea pig. If a terrorists strike a big country or a city, the whole world knows about it. The tragedy with these countries is that their miseries are not broadcasted because of their non connectivity with the rest of the world. They are thus the breeding grounds of terrorism and worst hit areas by this destructive activity. \\nFive years after the 9/11, the main security threat faced by nations is not Al-Qaeda. It is the growing ability of small groups to inflict levels of damage unprecedented in history, and the growing inability of nations to check it. Through history, the state has been powerful and individuals weak. But education and technology have now made small groups powerful enough to threaten or decimate the state. This is true of both Islamic and non-Islamic groups. It is Trans-religious.\\nIRA cadres in Ireland and Basque terrorists in Spain and France are Christian terrorists. The Tamil tigers in Sri Lanka are Hindu terrorists who invented suicide bombing. In the 1970s and 1980s, the JVP in Sri Lanka represented Buddhism. The Aum Shinrikyo killed thousands with nerve gas in Tokyo. Maoists in Nepal represent secular terrorism. So do Indian Maoists who operate in 162 out of 602districts. Islamic terrorists have plenty of company. In the US itself, the Unabomber Kaczynski maimed and killed peopled for 18 years before being caught. The Oklahoma bombers killed 168 people in 1995. After 9/11, envelopes with anthrax were sent to the capitol and other places, causing panic in Washington. \\nDeadly explosives like RDX are available globally through sophisticated black markets, sometimes through the internet. So are Assault rifles, grenades and rockets. Cell phones provide communications that only the most sophisticated armies once had. Throw-away cell phones and changing e-mail address provide enough anonymity to foil the most sophisticated, Powerful intelligence agencies.\\nTo change things there should be understanding between people and the willingness to rise against this form of corruptive disaster. Corruption is another cause for all the terrorist activities. The future looks grim. With advancing technology, small groups will become even more powerful, and the state will become even less capable of stopping them. The state will probably respond by acquiring draconian powers and crushing civil liberties.
First and foremost, we must not subject ourselves to the corporate media monster to define and verify the existance of language. Thus, Google may not be used as a barometer of linguistics. Second, panic attacks, although catagorically similiar in causation (i.e. stress, anxiety, and claustrophobia) the panic leave is a separated and clearly distinguishible from panic attacks by its own subjugation of environmental factors. The combination of panic attacks and panic leaves is only a trivial matter since the mere occurance of both phenomena would be an improbability.  Lastly, Wikipedia must join hands with the international community to set itself above the constraints of our cyberspace network in order to insure and embrace the evolution of Language. \\nFrancis Macomber
Sustainability and development\\nProponents of sustainable development have been trying to reconcile the urgent needs of effective environmental protection and conservation of resources with economic development. While the concept has been politically successful at bringing sustainability into the mainstream, both in developed and developing countries, it remains controversial.[29]\\n\\nThe skeptics have pointed out that infinite economic growth is impossible on a finite planet, and that Earth’s limits also define the limits of all material-based activities. Some contend that the term itself is an oxymoron, creating the impression that humans can "have their cake and eat it too."[30] In reality, sustainable development has tended to mean nothing more than ecologically more sensitive growth — a slightly reformed status quo. Rebuttals involve, on one hand, the claims of expanding carrying capacity through human ingenuity, and on the other hand, a different conception of development.[31]\\n\\nSome of the advocates of sustainable development have argued it is best understood as qualitative improvement. In that case, development means “better” rather than “more” and an emphasis on quality of life, rather than material living standards. They call for better, not faster, lives and for a focus on values, not things. These advocates of a new paradigm urge a movement away from the dogma that the only wealth is material wealth, with the resulting development being recognized formally by an improvement in the quality of life indicators.[32]\\n\\nEnvironmental sustainability is the process of making sure current processes of interaction with the environment are pursued with the idea of keeping the environment as pristine as naturally possible.\\n\\nAn "unsustainable situation" occurs when natural capital (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of environmental degradation is the inability to sustain human life. Such degradation on a global scale could imply extinction for humanity.\\n\\nConsumption of renewable resources State of environment Sustainability \\nMore than nature's ability to replenish Environmental degradation Not sustainable \\nEqual to nature's ability to replenish Environmental equilibrium Steady-state economy \\nLess than nature's ability to replenish Environmental renewal Sustainable development \\n\\n\\n[edit] Human impact on the biosphere\\n \\nLand for nature - Catalonia \\nLand for humans - ChicagoThe Millennium Ecosystem Assessment provides the most comprehensive current synthesis of the state of the Earth’s ecosystems. Natural systems (often referred to as ecosystem services) are humanity's life-support system, providing the necessary conditions for humans to flourish. Over the last 50 years the rapidly escalating and potentially critical nature of human global impact on the biodiversity of these ecosystem services has become the source of major biological concern. [33] [26]\\n\\n\\nAt a fundamental level human impact on the Earth is being manifest through changes in the global biogeochemical cycles of chemicals that are critical to life, most notably those of water, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.\\n\\nThere is now clear scientific evidence that human activity is having a significant effect on all of these cycles.[34]\\n\\n\\nGLOBAL GEOCHEMICAL CYCLES CRITICAL FOR LIFE \\nNitrogen Cycle\\n \\nWater Cycle\\n \\nCarbon Cycle\\n \\nOxygen Cycle\\n \\n\\nPhosphorus cycle\\n \\n\\n\\n[edit] Protecting the biosphere\\nThere are two major ways of reducing human impact on the planet. The first is to monitor and respond to direct human impacts on the oceans and freshwater systems, the land and atmosphere (see direct impacts below). This approach is based on information gained from environmental science and conservation biology.[33] However, this is management at the end of a long series of causal factors (known to ecologists as drivers) that are initiated by human consumption, our demand for food, energy, materials and water [35] (see indirect impacts below). It is the assessment of consumer demand for these basic resources that is now a major study area for sustainability science which monitors resource use through the chain of human consumption starting with the effects of lifestyle choices and individual and collective spending patterns, through to the resources used in producing specific goods and services, the demands of economic sectors - and even national economies. This is pre-emptive demand management of causes, rather than a reactive response to the effects of this demand.Sustainability governance can be implemented at all levels of human and biological organization, from local to global.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Direct global environmental impacts\\n\\n[edit] Atmosphere\\nMain topic: climate change\\n\\n \\nUse of the atmosphere \\nTop of the atmosphereThe most obvious human impact on the atmosphere is the air pollution in our cities. The pollutants include toxic chemicals such as nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming the decrease is estimated at about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas: it also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.[36] [37] However, it is now human-induced climate change and the carbon cycle that have become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential for catastrophic effects on both biodiversity and human communities (see Energy below).\\n\\n\\n[edit] Oceans\\n \\nThorsmork, IcelandMain topics: overfishing, ocean acidification, marine pollution.\\n\\n \\nSaltwater fishOceans and their circulation patterns have a critical effect on climate and the food supply for both humans and other organisms. Major environmental impacts occur in the more habitable regions of the oceans – the estuaries, coastline and bays. Because of their vastness oceans act as a dumping ground for human waste. Trends of concern include: ocean warming, reef bleaching and sea level rise, all due to climate change together with the possibility for a sudden alteration of present-day ocean currents which could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe; over-fishing (beyond sustainable levels); and ocean acidification due to dissolved carbon dioxide.[4]\\n\\n\\nRemedial strategies include: more careful waste management, statutory control of overfishing, reduction of fossil fuel emissions, and restoration of coastal and other marine habitat.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Land\\nMain articles: Land use, land-use change and forestry, land cover, urbanization, deforestation.\\n\\nLand use change is fundamental to the operations of the biosphere. This includes alteration to biogeochemical cycles, effects of agriculture, proportions of forest and woodland, grassland and pasture.[4]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Forests\\nMain articles: forestry, deforestation, carbon sequestration, climate change.\\n\\nHistorically about 47% of the world’s forests have been lost to human use. Present-day forests occupy about a quarter of the world’s ice-free land with about half occurring in the tropics [38] In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but deforestation in the tropics is of major concern.\\n\\n \\nBeech Forest - Grib Skov, DenmarkForests can moderate the local climate and the global water cycle through their light reflectance (albedo) and evapotranspiration. They also conserve biodiversity, protect water quality, preserve soil and soil quality, provide fuel and pharmaceuticals, and purify the air. These free ecosystem services have no market value and so forest conservation has little appeal when compared with the economic benefits of logging and clearance which, through soil degradation and organic decomposition returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has estimated that about 90% of the carbon stored in land vegetation is locked up in trees and that they sequester about 50% more carbon than is present in the atmosphere. Changes in land use currently contribute about 20% of total global carbon emissions (in heavily logged Indonesia and Brazil it is the greatest source of emissions).[39] Climate change can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in reafforestation schemes, new plantations, and timber products. Wood biomass is a renewable carbon-neutral fuel.\\n\\n\\nThe FAO has concluded that, over the period 2005–2050, effective use of tree planting could absorb about 10–20% of man-made emissions – so clearly we need to monitor the condition of the world's forests very closely (both reafforestation and deforestation) as they must be part of any coordinated emissions mitigation strategy.[40]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Cultivated land\\nMain articles: agriculture, Green Revolution.\\n\\n \\nRice PaddyFeeding more than six billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth’s resources. This begins with the human appropriation of about 38% [41] of the Earth’s land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity[42]. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness – everything from the initial cultivation need for irrigation water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging, transport (now a major part of global trade) and retail. The benefits of food production are obvious: without food we cannot survive. But the list of costs is a long one: topsoil depletion, erosion and conversion to desert from tillage for monocultures of annual crops; overgrazing; salinization; sodification; waterlogging; high levels of fossil fuel use; reliance on inorganic fertilisers and synthetic organic pesticides; reductions in genetic diversity by the mass use of monocultures; water resource depletion; pollution of waterbodies by run-off and groundwater contamination; social problems including the decline of family farms and weakening of rural communities.[43]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Extinctions\\nMain articles: extinction, International Union for Conservation of Nature.\\n\\n \\nThe Dodo (Raphus cucullatus)In line with human migration and population growth, species extinctions have progressively increased to a rate unprecedented since the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event. Known as the Holocene extinction event this human-induced extinction of species ranks as one of the worlds six mass extinction events. Some scientific estimates indicate that up to half of presently existing species may become extinct by 2100.[44][45]\\n\\n\\nLoss of biodiversity can be attributed largely to the appropriation of land for agroforestry. Current extinction rate are 100 to 1000 times their prehuman levels with more than 10% birds and mammals threatened, about 8% of plants and 5% of fish and more than 20% of freshwater species.[4]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Biological invasions\\n \\nPueraria lobata, Kudzu infesting trees in Atlanta, GeorgiaMain articles: introduced species, invasive species.\\n\\nIncreasingly efficient global transport has facilitated the spread of organisms across the planet. The most stark examples are human diseases like HIV AIDS, mad cow disease and bird flu but invasive plants and animals are now, after climate change and land clearing, the greatest threat to native biodiversity.[46] Non-indigenous organisms often quickly occupy disturbed land but can also devastate natural areas where, in the absence of their natural predators, they are able to thrive.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Freshwater\\nMain articles: freshwater, desalination, limnology, list of countries by freshwater withdrawal, list of countries by total renewable water resources, water resources, water crisis.\\n\\n\\n \\nRiver Fluvia, CataloniaFreshwater habitat is the world’s most vulnerable of the major biological systems due to the human need for potable water for food irrigation, industry and domestic use. Human freshwater withdrawals make up about 10% of global freshwater runoff. [14] and of this 15-35% is considered unsustainable - a proportion that is likely to increase as climate change worsens, populations increase, and water supplies become polluted and unsanitary.[33]\\n\\n\\nIn the industrial world demand management has slowed absolute usage rates but in the developing world water security, and therefore food security, remain among the most important issues to address. Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water.[4]\\n\\n\\n\\n[edit] Indirect global environmental impacts\\nMain article: appropriate technology\\n\\nThe direct impacts on the environment described above are the result of a long chain of causal factors, which is why managing direct human impacts on oceans, atmosphere and land is sometimes called "end of pipe" management; it does not manage the indirect "start of pipe" drivers of this impact which can be reduced to three fundamental factors:\\n\\n \\nPeople - our numbers and consumption patterns (resource use) relate directly to environmental impactspopulation numbers \\nlevels of consumption (affluence) \\nimpact per unit of resource use (which is a result of the technology used) \\nThis has been expressed through an equation: [47]\\n\\nI = PAT\\n\\nwhere: \\nI = environmental impact \\nP = population \\nA = affluence \\nT = technology \\nThis equation has been criticised because: affluence may have positive and negative impact due to the fact that it could either provide the means to tackle environmental problems or promote a higher consumption rate; the equation does not include social considerations such the effect of efficient environmental governance; it is difficult to apply in a realistic and useful way. [48] Nevertheless, it provides a strong starting point for discussion.\\n\\n\\nAddressing sustainability now focuses much of its attention on managing levels of consumption and resource impact by seeking, for example, to modify individual lifestyles, and to apply ideas like ethical consumerism, dematerialisation and decarbonisation, while at the same time exploring more environmentally friendly technology and methods through ecodesign and industrial ecology.\\n\\nAt present individual and household use of resources like energy and water is monitored through domestic water and energy bills and car fuel use – but much greater quantities of these resources are embodied in the goods and services we use. In the same way society as a whole tends to consider environmental management in terms of direct impacts rather than their driver - human consumption. Patterns of consumption must reflect the cleverer use of resources: e.g. using renewable energy rather than fossil fuels and fewer embodied resources in goods and services.[49] [50]
Okinawa Volunteer Zombie Eradication Team\\n\\nBased out of Okinawa, Japan, the Zombie Eradication Team - Okinawa (ZETO) was establised by concerned deployed personnel.  The island of Okinawa is safe from most plague born infestations due to its location and removal from surrounding mainland.  However, its one strength is also it's demise as an infestation such as a Zombie plague may easily overun the local population if given the opportunity for transmission.  A single asymptomatic infected individual that arrived via boat or airplane could easily spread this infestation.  In almost any out-break scenario, modeling shows that not only would airlines be over-taxed and come to a complete stand still, but most harbours would simultaneously be overrun and eventually congested to the point that they would no longer be viable transportation options due to the large surge in refugees attempting to flee. Having all avenues of egress halted or otherwise inoperable, the remaining population is left to fend for its self against insurmountable odds, waging a fight against an enemy it never believed could exist. Chaos would undoubtedly ensue.\\n\\nIn light of this grim possibility, ZET was established to make the necessary precautionary methods to prevent such an outbreak.  Not only is this team among the few that even consider Zomibes a viable threat to man kind and have thus given thought to planning and considerations necessary for survival during a zombie contigency, they are also armed with skills and a select arsenal tailored towards zombie eradication. ZET is the best and only defense against a possible island-wide Zombie Horde.\\n\\nCurrently run under the control of Agent 666 and Agent 999.  ZET is quickly growing into a strong and effective force.\\n\\nUpdates to come soon.

Internet Explorer is the world’s most widely used web browser. \\n\\nMicrosoft said it planned to ship a security update, rated “critical,” for the browser on Wednesday. People with the Windows Update feature activated on their computers will get the patch automatically. \\n\\nThousands of websites have already been compromised by hackers looking to exploit the flaw. Malicious codes have been loaded on to those sites, which automatically infect visitors’ machines if they are using Internet Explorer and have not employed a complicated series of workarounds that Microsoft has suggested. Microsoft said it had seen attacks targeting the flaw only in Internet Explorer 7, but has cautioned that all other current editions of the browser are vulnerable.
{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\nA general definition of an ecological crisis the occurrences when the environment of species or a population changes in a way that destabilizes its continued survival. The main cause of the ecological crisis are human induced activities or anthropocentric acts like mining, pollution, deforestations, construction etcetera, for the global economy to grow.\\nThe solutions to the contemporary ecological crisis is sustainable development. Sustainable development is a type of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, not only for anthropocentric reasons but nature holistically. The concept of sustainable will be successful when the current population stabilize for natural resources to be evenly distributed’ for developed countries like the United States not to consume products that they do not need but they can rather make it accessible to countries who need those resources. \\nThe lifestyle as humans that we all should adopt is a culture of living in an environmentally friendly way. Like reusing, afforestation, and adopting traditions that have certain laws to use the environment sufficiently. The ideas of Saint Francis should be implemented because humans tend to have an idea that they are not part of nature or rather superior than nature which is not the case. \\nThe reason why human beings cause environmental degradation is because of the capitalistic regime. Humans in the ancient stages of life lived sustainably were they were part of nature. Nowadays humans maximize the use of natural resources to maximize their profits. That is why nature is exploited, it is a tool to produce and gain a lot of profit which will impact negatively now and in future.\\nHumans now have the obligation to make amends to the natural environment. Already climatic activities have been altered because of the human induced factors now it is up to humans to be part of nature. Humans need to be ethical about the actions that they act on.
Management in all business and organizational activities is the act of getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives using available resources efficiently and effectively. Management comprises planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization (a group of one or more people or entities) or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal. Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources and natural resources.\\nSince organizations can be viewed as systems, management can also be defined as human action, including design, to facilitate the production of useful outcomes from a system. This view opens the opportunity to 'manage' oneself, a pre-requisite to attempting to manage others.

Worse, much of the "notable" media available to give these new media entries press is limited, either by choice (e.g. being published by a otherwise notable publisher may require giving up significant intellectual property) or the added difficulty in gaining press in a dwindling collection of acceptable notable media outlets, due both to the closing of multiple long-running media outlets as well as the not-yet-established notability of newer media outlets, such as podcasts.\\n\\nIn short, the current attitude on Wikipedia makes adding articles on these subjects difficult, and leaves articles on these subjects vulnerable to deletion from editors following rigid policies that fail to acknowledge all but the most notable topics, which may frustrate readers interested in those subjects and discourage editors who happen to be experts in these topics if improving the articles becomes secondary to keeping those articles from being deleted.

Our gender includes a complex mix of beliefs, behaviors, and characteristics. (ADD CIT PP). Basic gender identity is usually formed by age three and is extremely difficult to change after that.[2] All societies have a set of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a social identity in relation to other members of society. Within the last 15 to 20 years, transgender has expanded to become an umbrella term applied to a diverse group of individuals whose gender identity or expression diverges from culturally deﬁned categories of sex and identity. (ADD CIT JOURNAL.) In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to males and females. In all societies, however, some individuals do not identify with the gender that is assigned to their biological sex. Some cultures employ processes of surgical or hormonal sex reassignment to bring people's biological characteristics in line with their gender identity. In other societies, membership of either of the gender categories is open to people regardless of their biological sex. Whether these differences are a product of nature or nurture has been a contentious topic in the social and biological sciences. It is still an open question to what extent genetic versus social factors plays in determining the gender identities of individuals.\\nThe term "gender identity" was originally a medical term used to explain sex reassignment surgery to the public,[3] but is also found in psychology, often as core gender identity.[4] Although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many factors have been suggested as influencing its development. Biological factors that may influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels and gene regulation.[5] Social factors which may influence gender identity include gender messages conveyed by family, mass media, and other institutions.[6] One's gender identity is also influenced by the social learning theory, which assumes that children develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors, and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way.[7] In some cases, a person's gender identity may be inconsistent with their biological sex characteristics, resulting in individuals dressing and/or behaving in a way which is perceived by others as being outside cultural gender norms; these gender expressions may be described as gender variant or transgender.[8]\\nSelf-concept or self-identity has come to mean how a person understands the way others perceive them. Gender identity does not only refer to the placing of a person into the categories male or female, but also includes the concept of interaction with society on a large scale. People who identify as transsexual may strongly desire that other people consider them to belong to a gender opposite of their karyotype; but often are simply trying to modify their bodies and behaviors to match how they feel inside. This may not have anything to do with being either male or female.\\nWith the development of gender identity being influenced by so many factors, there can also be many problems associated with gender identity as well. One of the major disorders is Gender Identity Disorder. Gender Identity Disorder is defined by strong, persistent feelings of identification with the opposite gender and discomfort with one's own assigned sex.[9] The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (302.85) has five criteria that must be met before a diagnosis of gender identity disorder (GID) can be made. "In gender identity disorder, there is discordance between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine."[3]\\nThe term "Gender Identity Disorder" is in and of itself an incredibly divisive issue. Identity conflicts need to continue over time to be a gender identity disorder. How the gender conflict occurs is different in each person. (ADD CIT .GOV). Many people including medical professionals, caregivers, scholars, researchers, students, human rights advocates, and members of the queer community advocate reform of the psychiatric classification of gender diversity as a mental disorder. This classification reinforces false, negative stereotypes of gender variant people and at the same time fails to legitimize the medical necessity of sex reassignment surgeries (SRS) and procedures for transsexual women and men who urgently need them. As a result, a widening segment of gender non-conforming youth and adults who are subject to the diagnosis of psychosexual disorder, are at risk of experiencing social stigma and loss of civil liberty.\\nToday there are many people supporting people with confusion about gender identity. People are fighting for positive movement towards LGBT people. Currently the President Obama is not signing the executive order protecting LGBT workers. This order would prohibit discrimination by federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. It has become a major focus for gay-rights groups. (ADD CIT) This order would protect an over 16 million more workers who are not already covered by existing corporate policies or state laws. They say LGBT workers suffer discrimination at a disproportionately high rate. The protection would add to an existing executive order prohibiting discrimination based on race, religion, sex and national origin.

Before the 20th century a person's sex would be determined entirely by the appearance of the genitalia, but as chromosomes and genes came to be understood, these were then used to help determine sex. Those defined as women, by sex, have genitalia that is considered female as well as two X chromosomes; those viewed as men, by sex, are seen as having male genitalia, one X and one Y chromosome. However, some individuals have a combination of these chromosomes, hormones, and genitalia that do not follow the traditional definitions of "men" and "women". In addition, genitalia vary greatly or individuals may have more than one type of genitalia. Also, other bodily attributes related to a person's sex (body shape, facial hair, high or deep voice, etc.) may or may not coincide with the social category, as woman or man. A survey of the research literature from 1955–2000 suggests that as many as one in every hundred individuals may have some intersex characteristic.[10] It is suggested that the disorder may be caused by genetic (chromosomal) abnormalities, hormone imbalances during fetal and childhood development, defects in normal human bonding and child rearing, or a combination of these factors.(ADD CIT WEB MD) Most people recognize that they have a gender identity problem before they reach adolescence. The disorder occurs more often in males than in females. ADD CIT WEB MD)\\nTranssexual self-identified people sometimes wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their primary sexual characteristics, secondary characteristics, or both. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. Historically, such surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is broadly against genital assignment, shaped to a significant extent by the mature feedback of adults who regret these decisions being made on their behalf at their birth. Gender reassignment surgery elected by adults is also subject to several kinds of debate. One discussion involves the legal sex-gender status of transgender people, for marriage, retirement and insurance purposes, for example. Another involves whether such surgery is ethically sound.[citation needed]\\nThe most easily understood case in which it becomes necessary to distinguish between sex and gender is that in which the external genitalia are removed—when such a thing happens through an accident or through deliberate intent, the libido and the ability to express oneself in sexual activity are changed, but the individual's gender identity may or may not change. One such case is that of David Reimer, reported in As Nature Made Him by John Colapinto. It details the persistence of a male gender identity and the stubborn adherence to a male gender role of a person whose penis had been totally destroyed shortly after birth as the result of a botched male circumcision, and who had subsequently been surgically reassigned by constructing female genitalia.[13] In other cases, a person's gender identity may contrast sharply with that assigned to them according to their genitalia, and/or a person's gendered appearance as a woman or man (or an androgynous person, etc.) in public may not coincide with their physical sex. So the term "gender identity" is broader than the sex of the individual, as determined by examination of the external genitalia, but also includes the sex or gender one identifies with mentally.\\n[edit]\\nHistory\\n[edit]\\nConceptual origins\\nIn 1905, Sigmund Freud presented his theory of psychosexual development in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality. Freud believed gender identity developed during the phallic stage of development. According to Freud, during this stage, young boys develop an Oedipus complex where they have an unconscious sexual desire for their mother and jealousy or hatred for their father. That jealousy turns into emulation as the child seeks to be like their father, eventually identifying with him.[7] In 1913, Carl Jung proposed the Electra complex as an analogous phenomenon in girls. This proposal, however, was rejected by Freud.[14]\\nDuring the 1950s and '60s, psychologists began studying gender development in young children, partially in an effort to understand the origins of homosexuality (which was viewed as a mental disorder at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the UCLA Medical Center for the study of intersexuals and transsexuals. Psychoanalyst Robert Stoller generalized many of the findings of the project in his book Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term gender identity to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in 1963. Behavioral psychologist John Money was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at Johns Hopkins Medical School's Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an interactionist theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book Man and Woman, Boy and Girl (1972) became widely used as a college textbook, although many of Money's ideas have since been challenged.[15]\\n[edit]\\nIn the DSM\\nFurther information: gender identity disorder\\nThe notion of gender identity appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in its third edition, DSM-III (1980), in the form of two psychiatric diagnoses of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and transsexualism (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, the DSM-III-R added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed the GIDC and transsexualism in a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder.[16]\\nThe conceptualization of sex-gender mismatch as a mental disorder is controversial.[16]\\n[edit]\\nInternational Human Rights Law\\nThe Yogyakarta Principles, which is a document on application of international human rights law, provides definition on gender identity. In the preamble, "gender identity" is understood to refer to each person's deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the person's sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other experience of gender, including dress, speech and mannerism. Further, in Principle 3, that each person's self-defined gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and Freedom. These Principles influenced the UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity.\\n[edit]\\nGender identity and sex\\nIn the English language, the terms sex and gender are often used interchangeably in the vernacular. However, in a medical and technically scientific sense, these words are not synonymous. Increasingly, the term gender is being accepted to define psychophysiologic processes involved in identity and social role. It is defined by one's own identification as male, female, or intersex; gender may also be based on legal status, social interactions, public persona, personal experiences, and psychologic setting. Sex, from the Latin word sexus, is defined by the gonads, or potential gonads, either phenotypically or genotypically. It is generally assigned at birth by external genital appearance, due to the common assumption that this represents chromosomal or internal anatomic status. (ADD CIT MEDSCAPE) Therefore gender and sex are different and is not being recognized as such.\\nWhen the gender identity of a person makes them one gender, but their genitals suggest a different sex, they will likely experience what is called gender dysphoria.[17] Some people do not believe that their gender identity corresponds to their biological sex, including transsexual people, transgender people, and many intersexed individuals. Consequently, complications arise when society insists that an individual adopt a manner of social expression (gender role) which is based on sex, that the individual feels is inconsistent with that person's gender identity. Complications can also arise with the stereotyping, or gender typing of behavior for individuals for behavior related to a specific sex, when they identify as a different gender. This dissonance can lead to gender identity disorder.\\nOne reason for such discordances in intersexed people is that some individuals have a chromosomal sex that has not been expressed in the external genitalia because of hormonal or due to other abnormal conditions during critical periods in gestation. Such a person may appear to others to be of one sex, but may recognize himself or herself as belonging to the other sex[citation needed]. The causes of transgenderism are less clear; it has been subject of much speculation, but no psychological theory has ever been proven to apply to even a significant minority of transgender individuals, and theories that assume a sex difference in the brain are relatively new and difficult to prove, because at the moment they require a destructive analysis of inner brain structures, which are quite small.\\nIn recent decades it has become possible to surgically reassign sex. A person who experiences gender dysphoria may then seek these forms of medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity. Alternatively, some people who experience gender dysphoria retain the genitalia that they were born with (see transsexual for some of the possible reasons), but adopt a gender role that is consistent with what they perceive as their gender identity.\\nThere is an emerging vocabulary for those who defy traditional gender identity; see Transgender and Genderqueer.[18]\\n[edit]\\nBiological causes of transsexuality\\nStudies of gonads, genitalia, and hormone levels in gender dysphoric persons have not been able to propose any biological explanations for why some persons experience gender dysphoria. One study of the brains of six transsexual male to female individuals have shown a correlation between the size of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc) and gender dysphoria. The BSTc is normally 2.5 times larger in men than in women, but the average among the male-to-female transsexuals was only 52% of the reference non-transsexual males, which lies within the normal female range.[19] Another study of the same group found that the number of somatostatin neurons in male-to-female transsexuals was also closer to the normal female range than to that of males, and one female-to-male transsexual was shown to have a neuron number within the normal male range.[20]\\n[edit]\\nNature versus nurture\\nAn ongoing debate in psychology is the extent to which gender identity and gender-specific behavior is due to socialization versus in-born factors. The mainstream view is that both factors play a role, but the relative importance of each is contentious.[citation needed]\\nBecause of the pervasiveness of gender roles, it is difficult to design a study which controls for the influence of such socialization. Individuals who are sex reassigned at birth offer an opportunity to see what happens when a child who is genetically one sex is raised as the other. The largest study of such individuals was conducted by Reiner & Gearhart on 14 children born with cloacal exstrophy and reassigned female at birth. Upon follow-up between the ages of 5 to 12, 8 of them identified as boys, and all of the subjects had at least moderately male-typical attitudes and interests.[21]\\nThe roles that are expected of men and women differ from culture to culture, indicating to some that nature may not be the sole determiner of gender identity.[citation needed]\\n[edit]\\nNon-Western gender identities\\nSee also: Third gender and Two-Spirit\\n[edit]\\nFa'afafine\\nIn some Polynesian societies, fa'afafine are considered to be a "third gender" alongside male and female. They are biologically male, but dress and behave in a manner considered typically female. According to Tamasailau Sua'ali'i (see references), fa'afafine in Samoa at least are often physiologically unable to reproduce. Fa'afafine are accepted as a natural gender, and neither looked down upon nor discriminated against.[22] Fa'afafine also reinforce their femininity with the fact that they are only attracted to and receive sexual attention from straight masculine men. They have been and generally still are initially identified in terms of labour preferences, as they perform typically feminine household tasks.[23] The Samoan Prime Minister is patron of the Samoa Fa'afafine Association.[24]\\n[edit]\\nHijra\\nIn the culture of the Indian subcontinent, a hijra is usually considered to be neither a man nor a woman. Most are biologically male or intersex, but some are biologically female. The hijra form a third gender, although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. They can run their own households, and their occupations are singing and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes prostitutes (for men), or long-term sexual partners for men. Hijras can be compared to transvestites or drag queens of contemporary western culture.[25]\\n[edit]\\nXanith\\nThe xanith form an accepted third gender in Oman, a gender-segregated society. The xanith are male homosexual prostitutes whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Xanith can mingle with women, and they often do at weddings or other formal events. Xaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their society, xaniths can marry women, proving their masculinity by consummating the marriage. Should a divorce or death take place, these men can revert to their status as xaniths at the next wedding.[26]\\n[edit]\\nSee also\\n	Gender bias\\n	Gender differences\\n	Sex/gender distinction\\n	Queer theory\\n	Queer studies\\n	Masculinity\\n	Femininity\\n	Intersexuality\\n	Identity (social science)\\n	List of transgender-related topics\\n[edit]\\nReferences\\n	^ Neil R., Carlson, and Donald Heth C..

THE CURRENT STATUS OF ICT IN ETHIOPIA\\n1 Overview An ICT policy should start with an assessment of the country’s current ICT situation. ICT in Ethiopia at present is at the very early stage of development. Nearly the entire rural population lacks telecommunications infrastructure. The vast majority of the population is dependent only on the conventional and traditional information delivery system, the radio or newspapers. Other major indicators pointing to the low level of ICT development in the country are: • Limitations in telecommunications network, which is mainly designed for voice grade communication, and limited numbers of both fixed and mobile telephones. • Lack of skilled human resources coupled with low ICT literacy. • Low level of Internet service and poor connectivity. • Underdeveloped physical and telecommunications infrastructure. • Underdeveloped market for computer hard- and software products aggravated by high cost of acquisition. • Lack of organized data and information resources, and poor accessibility to those that exist. • Limited or no public awareness on the role and potential of ICT. • Undeveloped private sector • Legal and regulatory constraints. \\nNot only is ICT least developed in Ethiopia; it is also highly skewed towards major cities and towns, particularly Addis Ababa. In part, this is due to limitations in both physical and ICT infrastructure, and partly due to the limited number of computers. Consequently, while the Internet and other forms of information and communications technology are readily available in Addis Ababa, limited access to ICT by the rural population continues to be a major impediment to the use of ICT nation-wide. These constraints present the Government with real challenges, but also opportunities, for an accelerated development of ICT in Ethiopia. \\n2 Government Efforts \\nEven though still in its infancy, ICT in Ethiopia has developed rapidly in recent years. In part this is because, in recognition of the vital importance of ICT in the development process, the Government has been undertaking several strategic policy initiatives that promote its development. Initiatives taken by the Government to 8 promote the development of ICT include the relevant components of PSCAP, in particular ICT capacity building, Electronic government (woreda-net) and Electronic education (school-net) programs. The development of ICT in Ethiopia has also been influenced by legal and regulatory measures. These include the 1996 proclamation providing for the introduction of competition and licensing for multiple operators. The private sector has since been active in providing ICT and related goods and services, and several firms provide computer hard- and soft-ware and services at present. Consistent with its policy objectives, the Government has been licensing large numbers of private sector operators to set up cyber-cafes and to engage in sales, installation and service of communications equipment. Although the private sector is expected to take the lead in ICT development, it has so far remained largely undeveloped with operations confined to major urban centers, particularly Addis Ababa, with limited or no activities in the rural areas of the country. Reform of Ethiopia’s telecommunications industry also resulted in the establishment of the Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation, a public telecom operator providing services in fixed, mobile, Internet and data communications. The establishment of the Corporation was followed by the introduction of Internet service in 1997 and mobile telephone service in 1998. The Corporation has been aggressively expanding rural connectivity in tandem with the Government’s decentralization, public and civil reform programs. The Government’s commitment to the development of ICT is also reflected in rising public expenditure in the sector. Public investment in ICT infrastructure and services increased substantially from a paltry US$29 million in 2002 to US$300 million in 2004. Increases in investment have resulted in improvements in ICT infrastructure and services nation-wide both in the public and private sectors. Technologies and services that have particularly experienced expansion include telephone infrastructure and services, mobile/cellular telephone, mobile radio communication, pay-phones, the Internet, Internet cafe services and community centers, which provide a broad range of multi-purpose communication services such as the telephone, fax, computer, e-mail and media services. Even though recent trends in the development of ICT have shown dynamic growth in both infrastructure and services, ICT in Ethiopia still remains the least developed as compared to countries in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere in the world. Proper data communication network is only beginning to make its appearance, the number of computers remains negligible, and the availability of computer hard- and soft-ware products limited. \\nIt is clear, therefore, that much remains to be done, and the Government is determined to step up efforts for the development of ICT in the interests of sustainable growth and poverty reduction, as well as for deepening the process of democratization and good governance. The Government is already taking aggressive measures towards this end and has embarked on programs aimed at improving and expanding physical and ICT infrastructure and services as the backbone for the development of a robust ICT sector in the country.
Urban Photography is a popular form of photography documenting modern life within any populated geographic location. This form of photography tends to capture everyday life, seemingly from a first-hand account. It can be described as the combination of landscape and documentary photography. While documentary photography is very similar, urban photography generally does not capture a specific event or cause. Typical works of urban photography will feature city skylines, city-life, buildings, cars and people. This form of photography is especially popular among bloggers and amateur photographers.
I'm mostly editing for grammar, clarity, and oversight/bias at this point.  I'm interested in presenting things as neutrally as possible, a difficult part of which is incorporating relevant controversial views in proper context.  \\n\\nI don't know that much about the way oversight works on wikipedia, but it is such an influential source of information at this point that I think it has great potential to be manipulated by powerful interested parties.  Once beliefs become established within a culture, they carry the power of the status quo.  So we must guard against assuming the mainstream viewpoint is correct, while carrying information about relevant popular opinions.  \\n\\nRecently, I've been investigating corporate and or government corruption issues (medical study oversight, military contracting, fracking) and conspiracy theories about JFK, MLK assassinations, "the Fed" (still not sure what to make of all this), 9/11.

LGBT individuals are less likely to have strong family support systems in place to have relatives to care for them during aging. They are twice as likely to enter old age living as a single person; and two and a half times more likely to live alone. Because discrimination and harassment still exist, they are less likely to access health care, housing, or social services. When using such services to meet our needs, they often have to cope with others’ homophobia or ignorance.\\n \\nAdditionally, because of legal protections for partnership, most gay and lesbian partners face additional financial difficulties related to tax burdens, health insurance, and inheritance rights, many of which becoming particularly acute later in life. It is still legal to fire gay or lesbian seniors in 34 states because of their sexual orientation. Surviving lesbian and gay partners face different financial difficulties upon the death of their loved one.  They are not eligible for the Social Security survivor benefits as is a heterosexual married partner, heavily taxed on retirement plans—401(k) or IRA—inherited from partners, while married partners inherit these plans tax-free, and charged estate tax on inheritance of home, even if jointly owned, a tax that does not apply to married spouses.\\n\\nDespite advances in the acceptance of lesbians and gay men in many aspects of American life and more individuals living “out,” most retirement communities still do not welcome lesbians and gay men as residents.  Almost no communities address this issue in their policies or practices, and few offer cultural competency training for their staff in working with the LGBT community.  For decades, lesbians and gay men have entered retirement communities only by retreating to “the closet,” pretending to be sisters or cousins, or couples have split up and entered as individuals rather than as partners.  Many others forego the option completely, unwilling to live in a community where they would have to hide their identity and history.\\n\\nCurrent studies document homophobic policies and practices by nursing home administrators, Area Agencies on Aging directors, and health care providers, as well as out-right discrimination and mistreatment by staff in long-term care facilities.  Thus, lesbians, gay men and transgender individuals are five times less likely to seek adequate health care or needed social services out of fear of discovery and ridicule. \\n\\nAs a result, a trend in the active adult and retirement community housing market is the creation of communities specifically for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. \\n\\n'''External Links\\n'''\\n----\\n\\n[http://www.gaylesbianretiring.org Gay and Lesbian Association of Retired Persons]<BR>\\n[http://www.asaging.org/networks/index.cfm?cg=LGAIN Lesbian and Gay Aging Issues Network]<BR>\\n[http://www.flock2it.com Birds of a Feather Resort Communities] - Pecos, New Mexico<BR>\\n[http://www.opencirclecommunities.com Open Circle Communities] - Rehoboth Beach, Delaware<BR>\\n[http://www.palmsofmanasota.com Palms of Manasota] - Palmetto, Florida<BR>\\n[http://www.paradise-one.com Paradise One] - Easthampton, Massachusetts<BR>\\n[http://www.rainbowvisionprop.com Rainbow Vision Properties] - RainbowVision
{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n\\nDeep Green Resistance (DGR) is an environmental movement that views mainstream environmental activism as being largely ineffective.[1] DGR also refers to the strategy described by the movement for saving the Earth. DGR believes that industrial civilization is endangering all life on the planet. It advocates for a radical shift in society's structure and function and calls for humans to actively fight for the Earth. DGR's goals are to stop those in power from destroying the planet and to stop industrial civilization altogether. Ultimately, they intend for landbases to be restored and for the human communities that inhabit these areas to be sustainable. DGR has attracted attention because of its controversial nature--it does not condemn violent protest as inappropriate environmental activism.\\n\\nBeliefs\\n\\nThe Deep Green Resistance movement believes that civilization, particularly industrial civilization, is fundamentally unsustainable and must be actively dismantled in order to secure a livable future for all species on the planet.[1] DGR identifies several traits that make industrial civilization a threat to the planet. Civilization relies heavily on machinery, which operates largely on non-renewable and unclean fossil fuels. Civilization has been mechanized beyond the scale at which human communities can operate equitably. Industrial agriculture has caused a dramatic population increase, which DGR cites as the cause of "global ecological devastation". In geological time civilization is a recent phenomenon and DGR argues that its expansion has resulted in the loss of a great deal of traditional knowledge. Cities, which form a basis for civilization, are believed to be unable to sustain themselves by DGR.  \\n\\nDGR's principles stem from the concept of Deep Ecology, which states that all species are inherently equal, and thus that humans are not superior to any other form of life. Deep Ecology attributes the current environmental crisis to the anthropocentrism that is embedded in Western perspectives. The term, first used by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess, was quickly taken up by a variety of radical environmental groups, such as Earth First!. Deep ecology provides a foundation upon which to base the cross-cultural nature-based spirituality that is often associated with radical environmental movements. \\n\\nThe movement differentiates itself from "Bright Green Environmentalism", which is characterized by a focus on personal, technological, or government and corporate solutions,[1] in that it holds these solutions as inadequate. DGR believes that lifestyle changes, such as using travel mugs and reusable bags and taking shorter showers, are too small for the large scale environmental problems the world faces. It also states that the recent surge in environmentalism has become commercial in nature, and thus it in itself has been industrialized. The movement asserts that per capita industrial waste produced is orders of magnitude greater than personal waste produced; therefore, it is industrialism that must be ended, and with that lifestyle changes will follow.\\n\\nTactics\\n\\nThe Deep Green perspective argues that the dominant culture, a term that encompasses all societies that are based on industrialism, will not undergo a voluntary transformation to a sustainable way of living. This includes the dismissal of a possible success of a slow and soft shift to sustainability. Individuals of the Deep Green movement believe that industrial civilization will inevitably collapse. This notion is based on historical evidence of the collapse of major civilizations such as Rome or the Mayan civilization. DGR maintains that humans must be act decisively before the collapse to ensure the Earth that remains is inhabitable for all organisms and that humans build a more sustainably structured society following the collapse. The Deep Green Resistance supports an active resistance movement with the objective of accelerating the collapse of industrial civilization.[1]\\n\\nWithin the Deep Green theory, lifestyle or personal changes are not considered effective methods of creating meaningful change. The mainstream environmental movement is seen as being distracted by its emphasis on individual lifestyle changes and technological solutions instead of confronting systems of power and holding individuals, industries, and institutions accountable. [2][3]\\nThe founders of the Deep Green movement view technological solutions, no matter how well intentioned, as unsatisfactory and warns they could even lead to accelerated ecological destruction and pollution (see Jevons Paradox). The Deep Green movement looks to pre-industrial and pre-civilization, land-based cultures as models for sustainable ways of living.[1]\\n\\nOrigins and Advocates\\n\\nThe term was created for a conference entitled "Deep Green Resistance. Confronting Industrial Culture" in April, 2007 in Deerfield, Massachusetts. Lierre Keith was the main organizer.\\n\\nDeep Green theory draws on elements of anthropology, phenomenology, deep ecology and ecofeminism.\\n\\nDerrick Jensen is a prominent public advocate of Deep Green Resistance. In addition to being a radical activist, he is also a writer, philosopher and teacher. Lierre Keith, another well-known member is a feminist activist, writer and small farmer. Another advocate is activist, writer and organic farmer Aric McBay. Waziyatawin, Stephanie McMillan, and Jack D. Forbes are also prominent members of the movement. DGR draws on the philosophy and writings of many authors, including Richard Manning, Andrea Dworkin, Peggy Reeves Sanday, David Abram, Chellis Glendinning, Chris Hedges, Joseph Tainter, Richard Heinberg, Daniel Quinn, Zoe Blunt and Jerry Mander, among others.[1]\\n\\nLiterature and References\\n\\nA book titled Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet by Aric McBay, Lierre Keith, and Derrick Jensen was released in May 2011, from Seven Stories Press.[4] The book is divided into four sections: Resistance, Organization, Strategy and Tactics, and the Future. Each section contains several essays written by McBay or Keith and concludes with Jensen's answers to common questions about resistance. The book intends to provide a framework from which readers can build upon in order to begin fighting for environmental change.\\n\\nCriticism\\n\\nMajor opposition against Deep Green Resistance is similar to opposition toward anarcho-primitivism and Deep Ecology. Opponents claim that technology and social changes will exist in the future to solve the problems. They also frequently state that advocates of DGR's beliefs are merely misanthropic, destructive nihilists, and that the end of industrial civilization would pose a moral dilemma because of the need for a reduced population (due to the end of industrial agriculture and mass production) and the relinquishment of life-saving technologies.[5][6] Therefore, many argue that DGR does not offer a feasible or desirable alternative human lifestyle. Opponents believe that DGR's goals are unrealistic because they are too extreme to become widely accepted in today's society.[7]\\n\\nDeep Green Resistance is controversial, in a large part, because they do not condemn violent action as a means by which to invoke environmental change. While DGR maintains that it is a strictly aboveground movement and denies having an underground, it does encourage underground action. This is construed as ecoterrorism by critics, and can be a deterrent to environmentalists who believe in nonviolent activism.\\n\\nIt may also be true that, as the environment's degradation[8] increases, DGR's viewpoint may gain more supporters. The Earth First![9] / Edward Abbey[10] perspective around monkey-wrenching[11] and eco-tage[12] were, arguably, a problematic way of addressing problems at that time (for an interesting display of division within the green radical movement on a previous occasion when a perspective similar to that held by DGR was popular, see the book Defending the Earth[13], which recounts debate between Earth First!'s David Foreman[14] and the social ecologist Murray Bookchin[15], centered around statements on the part of Foreman that Bookchin deemed anti-human). Now, it is possible that the ecological inertia[16] and the inertia of the global capitalist-industrial system[17] means that only such methods are meaningful. Many are, and should be, discomfited by such suggestions. However, it is a long time since the Club of Rome[18] report 'Limits to Growth'[19], the Brundtland report[20], and subsequent efforts to engage international governmental and corporate support were instituted (for example the Kyoto[21] and Rio[22] summits under the auspices of the UN), and many would now perceive them as having failed[23] [24] (and, to the extent that they are argued to have been successful, many would argue that there has been a profit-protecting greenwash[25] [26] to hide minimal actual change).\\nDGR is one response to a situation that many perceive as beyond control. Its members have an approach to fighting back, and see themselves as tomorrow's freedom fighters, whilst being fully aware that the underground (perhaps willing to use physical coercion, for example) part of the movement, at least, is currently more likely to be perceived as terrorist in nature, though the overground[27] part of the movement is more subtle, adhering to a code of conduct[28]. In the book, the activities of an underground are signposted more than they are explicated, which is a wise move on the part of its authors. And, in fact, they seek to inform and educate on 'security' and 'warfare' whilst at the same time denying that they represent an 'underground', as this quote from their website illustrates:\\n"It provides an exploration of organizational structures, recruitment, security, and target selection for both aboveground and underground* action. Deep Green Resistance also discusses a culture of resistance and the crucial support role that it can play.\\n"Deep Green Resistance is a plan of action for anyone determined to fight for this planet—and win\\n"*Note: We are strictly an aboveground movement. We will not answer questions regarding anyone’s personal desire to be in or form an underground. We do this for the security of all involved with Deep Green Resistance."[29]\\nFurther critique from this perspective, quite strongly expressed (the article accuses DGR of 'crypto-green-fascism') can be seen on the Libcom website, for example[30].
Street Jumping is a North American term for Free Running. The reason for the change in name is mainly because in North American there are less broken down and abandoned areas as in former U.S.S.R. countries, such as Russia. As a result, Street Jumpers do less running, and more jumping over various obstacles, such as fences, public trash cans, Postal boxes, ect.\\n\\nIt is widely believed that Street Jumping, or Free Running, has been practiced long before it was introduced by Sebastien Foucan. All over the world, children and teens would go to great lengths to pass obstacles in the fastest and, in this case, most interesting way. This was never internationally recognized, but it was practiced in cities around the globe.\\n\\nStreet Jumping is a North Americanized form of Free Running, which in turn is a more relaxed and aesthetics form of Parkour. Some might even argue that it is just a more developed and extreme version of the popular game "Cops and Robbers".\\n\\nAlthough very similar, Street Jumping is to Free Running, what Free Running is to Parkour. I don't think that both articles should be merged, as the term "Free Running" is not as widely know or used in some regions of North America, especially Canada. They are different, and, as a result they both deserve different articles.
Poverty is a state that some people in the world are in which includes them, having little or no money, little support, and having poor conditions. In my opinion, too many people in the world are in poverty, especially in other countries. People, especially in different countries, should have the privilege to obtain good health, money, and a fair amount of support. My prediction is that the United States doesn’t have a big percent of population in poverty. Also, I think that some countries in South America and certain places in Europe don’t have as high as percentage of people in poverty as other places. On the other hand, Countries and cities in Africa, Asia, and Mexico might have a higher percentage of the population in poverty. Poverty cannot be classified in counties, because one part of the country might be rich and one part might be poor. It is easier and more accurate to classify percentages of poverty by towns, and city, because for the most part the whole city or town is either in poverty or it isn’t.
[[image:climber.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A pet rat.]]\\nCitizens on Planet Earth have had a difficult time governing themselves over all of the millennia that this small planet has had intelligent citizens.

Protein Translation Engineering. The process of manipulating DNA code and conditions which affect the interaction of mRNA at the ribosome level to link amino acids together to form proteins. This process can include, but is not limited to silent changes or changes which substitute or delete amino acids from the final protein. In addition to direct manipulation of DNA code, translation engineering can be controlled and effected by changing the environment in which the the DNA message interacts with the ribosome. This can include but is not limited to, temperature, the abundance (or lack thereof) of key tRNAs, induction times and a variety of other factors including choice of cell line for protein express.\\n\\nSilent changes and translation engineering\\nDNA interacts with the ribosome, three letters at a time. These three letters or triplets are called "codons". All of the millions proteins in every living thing are composed of amino acids, the essential building blocks of life. For each amino acid, multiple codons exist, each

Many of the most difficult and pressing issues faced by society—how to mitigate and adapt to climate change and sea-level rise, how to manage the effects of ocean acidification, and how best to conserver marine resources and biodiversity—cannot be addressed effectively without improved understanding of Southern Ocean processes and feedbacks and their sensitivity to change. The most urgent research challenges in the Southern Ocean often span traditionally separate scientific disciplines. The SOOS will facilitate and enhance current observation efforts to provide the sustained, integrated, multi-disciplinary observations required to meet these challenges.\\n\\n\\n'''Scientific Rationale'''\\nThe Southern Ocean is fundamental to the operation of Planet Earth as we know it. It is the central connection between the major ocean basins, and between the upper and lower layers of the global ocean circulation. It exerts a major influence on global climate, and on planetary-scale biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems (see e.g., Rintoul et al. 2001, Sarmiento et al., 2004; le Quere et al., 2007; Meredith et al., 2012). The Southern Ocean is changing rapidly, with profound global ramifications. These changes include a large-scale warming that exceeds the global average, including several “hotspots” of extreme regional warming (Böning et al, 2008; Gille, 2008). Both upper and lower limbs of the Southern Ocean overturning have freshened, due to changes in the hydrological cycle and ice melt (Böning et al, 2008). The rate at which the Southern Ocean can draw down anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere has likely weakened (Meredith et al. 2012), though acidification is already underway with strong implications for marine species and populations (Rintoul et al., 2012). The climatic changes are already impacting on the functioning of the Southern Ocean ecosystems (Schofield et al., 2010), with implications for some commercially important species. The critical need to observe and understand the Southern Ocean is thus well established, however the harsh conditions and remote location has led to it being the most under-sampled region of the world. Sustained, multidisciplinary observations are required to detect, interpret and respond to the physical, chemical and biological changes occurring.\\n\\nMore information on the scientific rationale and implementation strategy of the SOOS can be found in the <ref>''Southern Ocean Observing System: Initial Science and Implementation Strategy''</ref>, which is available for download from the SOOS website (www.soos.aq)\\n\\n\\n'''Sponsors'''\\nThe SOOS is an initiative of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR). The SOOS is endorsed by the Partnership for Observation of the Global Oceans (POGO), the "Climate Variability" (CLIVAR) project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), and "Climate and the Cryosphere" (CliC).\\n\\nThe SOOS International Project Office is hosted by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania, Australia.

\\n== '''HISTORY''' ==\\n\\n\\nFuture Fibre Technologies (FFT) was established in 1994 in Melbourne, Australia as a company researching and developing fibre-optic sensing technologies. It began as a small start-up company with an idea to use optical fibres to detect vibrations caused by physical defects in or disturbances to structures such as bridges and pipelines. This led to the first FFT product, the Movement and Vibration sensor. \\n\\nBy the late 1990s, it was becoming clear that there was a need in the intrusion detection industry for cost effective distributed optical fibre sensors to protect large perimeters, buried pipelines and communications links. In 1998, FFT conceived the Microstrain Locator technology which had the potential to pinpoint the location of intrusions over many km’s of deployed optical fibre. Research and development efforts over the next 5 years led to the first commercialisation in 2002 of FFT’s core products – FFT Secure Fence, FFT Secure Pipe and FFT Secure Link.  \\n\\nBy 2008 FFT had over 1 million metres of optical fibre installed in over 150 intrusion detection systems worldwide.  This includes a number of key military, government and civil installations establishing FFT as a key global player in the intrusion detection industry.\\n\\nToday, FFT continues to be a key player in the intrusion detection industry with a growing business, expanding product portfolio and global reputation.
Christianity is a monotheistic Abrahamic religion of those who believe that Jesus of Nazareth was not merely a teacher and model of a pious life, but is the revealer of God and the mediator of salvation from sin. It shares the Old Testament teachings with Judaism. Mainstream Christians agree on the resurrection of Jesus and the Trinity (God the Father, Jesus the Son and the Holy Ghost) Jesus representing the immanence and the Holy Spirit the Transcendance of God – God being infinite and only knowable through Jesus and the Holy Ghost. Christianity has developed into six main ecclesiastico-cultural bloks: Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, Independents and Marginals (Barratt, 2001:3-5). Christianity is especially based in the Gospels of the New Testament, although it also draws on the Old Testament, believing the Bible to be the word of God. The main injunctions of Christianity are ‘Love God’ and ‘Love thy neighbour’. The former has led Christianity to be exclusive in its faith with a history of violence in the attempt to convert infidels and a stereotype of disrespect for other faiths – these indiscretions being taken as an inseparable part of Christianity (Küng, 1995:7-9). The latter has given Christianity the inspiration to apply its teachings (from c.500 onwards) to create a society of equality in terms of health and education.
'''\\n== GMOs ==\\n''' \\n\\n\\nDo you want to live in a world where weeds are tolerant to herbicides, causing farmers to use more and more herbicides? Do you want to live in a world where there is a major increase in allergies? Do you want to live in a world where all plants that are consumed by humans are GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) or in a world that there are antibiotic resistant super-diseases? GMOs are made by adding DNA from other organism into a crop causing it to do a specific task, like being tolerant to herbicides. One of the major problems with GM (Genetically Modified) food is that it is poorly tested and even though the tests were negative GM foods are on the market. Two other major problems are that GMOs are unlabeled. Once a GM food is created the genetic contamination cannot be cleaned up or contained. Some companies that produce GMO foods were also behind the development of risky chemicals suck as DDT and Agent Orange.\\n\\n\\nGMOs have not been tested as much as they should. Even though they have had some testing, the results show that they should not have been put on the market. A study showed that when young rats were fed GM potatoes, they developed pre-cancerous cell growth, damaged immune systems, partial atrophy of the liver and an inhibited development of the brain, livers and testicles. Cows fed GM corn died. Twice the number of chickens died when fed GM corn compared to those fed natural corn. Soon after GM soy was introduced to the UK, soy allergies increased by 50%.\\n\\nThe European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong all have labeling laws for all GM food but The United Stated and Canada has not passed a law. 60 - 70% of the food in grocery stores in Canada is GM food. We need labeling for GM food so it is essential to get laws passed to get GM food labeled. The consequences are catastrophic to both humans and the environment if we continue eating GM food, but we need labeling laws to know if we are eating it or not.\\n\\nThe same biotech company, Monsanto, that makes Roundup Ready Soy, which is soy that is resistant to herbicides allowing you to use 70% more herbicides, produces and sells the herbicide Roundup used on those crops. Using more herbicides is dangerous due to biological amplification. The companies claim that GMO crops will not contain herbicides. That is true but the weeds will become immune to the amount of herbicide used making the farmer use more and more herbicides. Eventually the herbicide resistant gene will be passed onto weed relatives making herbicide-resistant super weeds. Round Up Ready crops will survive being sprayed with herbicides allowing farmers to use more herbicides. Monsanto makes 160 million gallons of Roundup herbicide a year. This amount of herbicides is extremely bad for the environment.\\n\\nIf biotech companies continue creating and using GM food, the GM food will take over all other natural crops and we can’t reverse this. So if these bio-tech companies produce a GM food that is deadly, causes cancer or makes us sick, there is no way to stop it. The only way to stop the creation of GM food is to know if we are eating it or not and the only way to know that is to have mandatory labeling laws. If most people stop eating GM food then the biotech companies would not produce it anymore. The biotech companies have no real knowledge of what effects this unnatural product can have on human health or the health of our planet. GMO companies are destroying our world and if we continue this we will have nothing left--[[User:Ryancragg|Ryancragg]] 14:17, 22 October 2005 (UTC)\\n==Image Tagging for [[:Image:Bohr2.gif]]==\\nThanks for uploading '''[[:Image:Bohr2.gif]]'''.

== tornadoinsight ==\\n\\nA tornado is a violently rotating column of air which is in contact with both a cumulonimbus cloud base and the ground on earth. Only in rare cases is it made with a cumulus cloud. Tornadoes can come in many sizes, but are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, with the narrow end touching the ground. Most tornadoes have winds of 110 miles per hour or less. They are about 250 feet across, and travel a few miles before dissipating. Some tornadoes can have winds of 300 miles per hour, and can be more than a mile across. They have recorded tornadoes on every continent except for Antarctic. On an average year, there are about 800 tornadoes that cause about 80 deaths and around 1500 injuries. Once a tornado in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, carried a motel sign 30 miles and dropped it in Arkansas! They develop in warm, moist air most of the time.

'''Academic Art''', a style of painting and sculpture, particularly the style sanctioned by the French Académie des Beaux-Arts in the 19th century. Although the French Academy was then the dominant arbiter of artistic taste, it had influential counterparts in other nations, particularly the Royal Academy in England. The annual exhibitions, or salons, of the national academies featured the work of members and other work selected by a jury. Most salon art reflected the taste of the new bourgeoisie, which was often sentimental and literary, with cultural pretensions.\\n\\nAcademic art was characterized by a respect for classical antiquity, faithful transcription of nature, illusionistic space, minute detail, and eclectic borrowing from the past. It was basically retrogressive, with an emphasis on traditionalism, and usually lacked originality. It was against the canons of academic art that the progressive artists of the 19th century constantly battled, and their reaction against it led to the rise of styles that were diametrically opposed to the academic.\\n\\nThe birth of impressionism in the 1870s brought the dominance of academic art to an end. In the 20th century, when the intense opposition to academic art had diminished, some merits were found in it as a reflection of its time and for its sound technique.
Thanks to the technology we have today it is much more difficult to limit the flow of information. Resources such as wikipedia and google give us the ability to have a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips. Unlike books, there is no single author who can change facts to suit his own ideas. Millions of easily accessible sources eliminate the monopoly of information that was once held by the rich, and allows anyone to post their opinion, making biases much more easily detectable. How does this system compare to what was available to Liesel?\\n<br />\\nIn fact that’s a question that is quite easy to answer. The MMC library offers a large number of books that relate to the holocaust. I ''strongly'' recommend that you check out “The war against the Jews” by Lucy S. Dawidowicz.
== History ==\\n\\nPanda Kitchen and Bath was established in 2000 by the Huang Family in Miami, Florida.  The Huang family had been in the cabinetry and granite business since the 1980s in mainland China.\\n\\nWhen the Huang family came to the U.S. in 1998, they purchased a home and visited their local retail store to inquire about kitchen and bath remodeling.  They found that their remodeling plans were out of reach; homeowners needed an average household income of over $80,000 to afford a kitchen and bath upgrade.\\n\\nWith their decades of experience in the construction industry behind them, the Huang family conducted research and discovered that they could cut the price of a kitchen and bath remodel project up to 70%, making the projects affordable to those with an average household income of $60,000.  This would open the opportunity to an additional 12-18% of customers that previously could not afford a kitchen and bath remodel.  And, they could do it with high-end materials.
Hurricane Katrina: a severe natural disaster in North America in 2005:\\n	A natural disaster is an external environmental factor. The area where a natural disaster occurs has many effects and influences on different aspects of human lives. A hurricane is one of the external environmental factors of natural disasters. The hurricane is a storm formed over tropical oceans. It can spread over hundreds of thousands of square miles. The factors involved for generating a hurricane are ocean (warm surface water), rain (high humidity), winds from the same direction at a constant speed, and gravitational forces. Heat is extracted from the ocean and warm, moist air begins to rise. The moist air forms clouds and instability in the upper atmosphere and begins to spiral. The sea becomes turbulent because of the spiraling movement. Then a large amount of sea water is captured and suspended in the air. This situation increases the rate of evaporation and helps fuel the storm (Bradford and Carmichael, 2009, pp.167-168). A severe hurricane has a wind with a speed greater than 64 knots (74 miles per hour), according to the Beaufort scale. Generally, a hurricane originates in the tropical parts of the Atlantic Ocean or the Caribbean Sea. (thefreedictionary.com)\\nHurricane Katrina in 2005 in North America\\n	There were some fatal hurricanes in the past. One of the notable fatal hurricanes was hurricane Katrina. It happened from August 25 though September 2, 2005 in North America. The most affected areas were south Florida, the Florida Panhandle, coastal Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, particularly New Orleans. It was the second fatal disaster because of the hurricane after the 1900 Galveston hurricane and the costliest one in the U.S. history. About 2,000 people died and estimated property damaged was $75 billion in the event of hurricane Katrina (Shuman, 2007, p.265) whereas about 8000 people died in the event of 1900 Galveston hurricane (Larson, 1999, p.265). There are 5 categories of hurricane according to their storm intensity. The 5th category storm is a devastating, sustaining wind greater than 155 miles per hour. Hurricane Katrina was assessed as category 4 at landfall and the intensity of the storm reached category 5 level. Hurricane Katrina affected different aspects of lives in those affected areas and the USA as a whole (Bradford and Carmichael, 2007, P.175, volume 1). Hurricane Katrina affected many aspects which included economic, social, political, and governmental aspects of the USA.\\nGeneral economic effects during the year 2005\\n	Employees generally get their payment at the end of every month for their services. When hurricane Katrina occurred, many people were about to receive their payment at the end of the month from their employer. The storm struck at the end of August. They could not get their payment before the hurricane Katrina hit them. Therefore, most of them did not have enough money to arrange the rescue activities. They were compelled to live in their own places. In the hurricane Katrina event, most of the helpless people lost their lives (Shuman, 2007). Almost all of the industries, factories, farms, forests, roads, electricity, and businesses were either badly affected or destroyed entirely. During the year 2005 after the event, hundreds of thousands of local residents lost their jobs. Many insurance companies did not provide insurance in that area and some of the insurance companies raised their insurance premiums for houses, business activities and so on because of the high risk of fatal hurricane. Many people could not afford for the insurance premium. Therefore, people could not get insurance for the future risk. The economic activities became very slow. Because of the unemployment and destruction of industries, the financial activities were reduced sharply. As a result the government could not collect adequate taxes. Therefore, local government would not able to rebuild the infrastructure facilities in the state and the effected areas. The development activities in those areas in the year of the event were almost none. The priorities of the government were the rehabilitation of the affected people. The then government had sought for help billions of dollars for repairs and reconstruction in the region. The figure in terms of dollars of loss because of damages to the economy caused by destruction of infrastructure facilities was huge. The property damaged was about $ 89 billion (Burton and Hicks, 2005). Thus, the destruction of property and loss of lives burdened the state and federal government in many ways.  The extra burdens were to generate the employments, to rebuild the infrastructure facilities, to keep proper law and an ordered situation, and to develop the state(s) in all respects. \\nGeneral economic effects after 2005\\n	The economic factor plays a vital role in human lives. Political stability, health care issues, job market, industry growth, business growth, education and other societal aspects are greatly influenced by the economy of a country. We have seen many problems in the countries where the economic situation is not good enough. The root of the problems in other aspect of life is an economic factor. The natural disaster first affects the economic sector. The hurricane Katrina badly affected the economic sector as well as took the lives of many people. Therefore, there were many problems after the Katrina event. Many obstacles emerged in rebuilding the economy of the disaster area. Hurricane Katrina caused short as well as long term economic impacts to the federal and state governments. Federal government had to allocate extra budget for rebuilding and developing those areas. For that purpose, the government needed extra funds. The government had to raise funds either increasing its debt capital (issuing government bonds), or increasing the taxes. It was extra burden to the people and government. Therefore, financial activities were not satisfactory in the areas where major destructions occurred. As a result of slow financial activities, development activities could not accelerate. This situation created many problems in the people’s lives and corporate operations. It will take a long time for the recovery of the wounds because of the fatal destruction of property and life.\\nMoreover, the recent financial market crash added another problem to people and corporations who were severely affected because of the natural disaster. Therefore, hurricane Katrina will have the negative impacts in many years’ in future in finance, infrastructure and development sectors.\\nInternal politics\\n	Hurricanes can not be prevented. Therefore, necessary steps need to be taken to avoid the loss of life and property. The state government of Louisiana declared a state of emergency on August 26. The then Governor Kathleen Blanco of Louisiana requested federal government to provide National Guard troops to help meet the emergency. Governor Haley Barbour of Mississippi and Governor Bob Riley of Alabama also declared a state of emergency. The governor of Louisiana asked then President George W. Bush to declare a federal state of emergency in his state. However, The White House gave the authority to the department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to respond on the emergencies due to hurricane. After the event, local and state agencies responded in an efficient manner as compare to federal government (Shuman, 2007). The state and federal governments were not well prepared for the emergency management, environmental policy, poverty and unemployment. The storms’ devastation prompted the political reactions. The ruling party lost its popularity. Federal government’s ruling Republican Party reached at the lowest point of popularity. Then President George W. Bush was blamed for lack of leadership. The delayed response to the fatal disaster of federal government and lack of emergency management raised the issue of racism. The majority of victims of hurricane Katrina were African-American. They were low income people. These victims spent more time in temporary shelters and were more vulnerable to permanent displacement as compared to middle-income and white people (Bullard and Wright, 2009, p.4). Because of this reason, the issue of race immerged quickly. African American people perceived that the federal government did not response immediately with the purpose because the disaster area was the black dominated area. Such thinking was extremely bad for the harmony of the society. \\nAs we mentioned earlier, the government was not prepared for such of huge destruction. Because of that reason, rescue operation after the terrible destruction was not efficient and got the criticism from different angles. Politicians tried to grab political gain taking the advantage of the vulnerable situation. It resulted on the loss for the ruling party and a huge gain for the opposition party. This became a permanent reputation loss of then administration and the republican. The opposition did not get the criticism. The then opposition party gained the political arena because of the political image loss of the ruling party. This has been a short term as well as a long term gain to the then opposition party. It needed extra time and efforts to understand the reality. However, this factor contributed to the greater political impact to the politicians and people in general. \\nExternal politics\\n	Hurricane Katrina drew the attention of the politicians at the world wide level because of the rescue operation and crisis management after the tragic event. The minority community and economically marginalized people of the affected area were worried for their future settlement since they could not do anything without proper help. Many issues were raised because of the vulnerable situation and its settlement. Because of the mismanagement of the prices of goods, services and reconstruction activities skyrocketed. Ehrlich Howard J. in his book “Hate Crimes and Ethnoviolence” quoted that “Americans spent $ 10 billion more over the week on energy than they did a year ago in the same week”(Ehrlich, 2009). People could hardly afford for the price of goods and service. \\nAnother issue was about the external help. For the immediate response to the hurricane Katrina victims, Cuban President Fidel Castro proposed for the help to US 1,586 disaster-trained physicians and 26 tons of medical supplies and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez proposed for cheap gasoline and humanitarian supplies (Ehrlich, 2009, P. 131). Because of the proximity, they could provide their assistance within few hours and lives of hundreds of injured people could be saved. But, White House rejected the humanitarian assistance. Many human lives could be saved and many peoples in trouble would get help. Because of the White House decision, general people perceived that then government ignored the sensitivity of the injured people because of its own political reasons” (Ehrlich, 2009). Without change in our behavior and thinking, we can not survive in this changing world. History has proved that without change according to the need of time, level of thinking of people and environment, nobody, no system and no civilization can survive in this changing world. Everything is possible but it is the matter of time and the environment. \\nSocio-psychological \\n	The badly affected area because of hurricane Katrina was New Orleans of Louisiana. The majority of residents in the New Orleans were African Americans. The majority of victims were black people. Moreover, people who were old, with ill health, children and poor who did not have vehicles to leave their places were the victims of the storms and floods. People surviving from the disaster were waiting for the food and water for five days. The rescue operation was delayed because of the lack of proper planning and management of rescue operations. The survivors were surrounded by dead bodies and sewage. The police protection, help and rescue operation were not implemented in time (Bassett, 2009). \\nThe government’s slow response raised the question of its intention.  That horrifying situation helped to raise the issue of race. The psychological impact was that the rescue operations were not enough and were bias because of race. The delay rescue operation had been another subject matter to carry out the truth before the public to maintain the harmonize relationship among the different groups in the society. Many people believe there was a need to harmonize the relationship but not fuel the issue of race which emerged during that period (Bullard and Wright, 2009).\\nSocial security\\n	The security situation in the New Orleans aftermath was very poor. People started looting in the stores after the hurricane moved away. Many helpless people were searching for food and water. Reports in the flood news were carjacking, murders, thefts and rapes. Some news was inaccurate because of confusion. To handle the situations, thousands of troops were deployed in the affected areas. Many arrests were made in the suspicion of improper activities in those areas. Criminal background checks on the refugees were conducted. Some people were sent to jail to maintain the law and order situation in that area (Shuman, 2007). In short, government was able to keep the law and order situation in the area despite the discrepancies on its rescue operation and emergency management. \\n Government’s efforts\\n	There were controversies on the news. Government had arranged to give immediate relief to the victims at its own pace. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) issued debit cards so that holders could purchase their daily needs without delay. Some of the debit cards were procured with fraudulently by the people. They were using false social security numbers who have died or they knew by any other means, false identifications to obtain the debit cards. The cards were used to pay luxury vacations and other illegal payment (Bradford and Carmichael, 2007, p.960). \\nFurther, government responded for rebuilding the city and disaster area because of the political reason. It was criticized that rebuilding the city was not wise enough because many people lost their lives, a lot property was destroyed and there is still high risk of Natural disasters in future. The government has been facing continuing problems for settling houses, employment, developing corporations, poverty, environmental policy issues and emergency management in those areas (Shuman, 2007). Therefore, government should seek alternative ways to settle the people of high natural disaster risk areas. \\nConclusion\\n	The rescue operation after the hurricane Katrina raised many issues. Similarly, the disaster left many negative impacts on the lives of people, and in political, social, and economical aspects. However, the problems and issues rose during or after the disaster helped to think and behave in a particular ways. Right decisions in time, early preparation for crisis management, planning for future development, adequate precautions for security of people and property, political and social movement, mutual respect among different beliefs, harmonize relationship among different groups of society could be overlooked otherwise in future in the very situation. Therefore, post and pre hurricane Katrina situations will be a proper path for future precautions. In the given scenario of the hurricane Katrina, the government should take appropriate steps to settle the people, and corporations in the safe zone. Moreover, we need to behave with people according to the new spirit and knowledge of 21st century era. Government should use the natural resources in such a way so that the loss of human resources and corporate property would be minimal. For example, Louisiana can be used to raise the forest and forest Industry. People living in Louisiana should be transferred to other safe states or areas. We should develop the education, health, finance, farms, and other businesses activities in relatively safe areas from natural catastrophes. We should use our land, forest, water and other natural resources optimally for the human beings and for the best interest of the nation. We have to rethink about the reconstruction program and should take the appropriate decision for the welfare of the people now and in future.\\n\\n\\nReferences\\nShuman, R. B.

Graphic design is a creative process—most often involving a client and a designer and usually completed in conjunction with producers of form (i.e., printers, signmakers, etc.)—undertaken in order to convey a specific message (or messages) to a targeted audience. The term "graphic design" can also refer to a number of artistic and professional disciplines that focus on visual communication and presentation. The field as a whole is also often referred to as Visual Communication or Communication Design. Various methods are used to create and combine words, symbols, and images to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use a combination of typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to produce the final result. Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.

Prior to this time, the style and traditions of the “ancien-regime” prevented the conceptualization of “the self”. Instead, one’s identity was considered malleable; subject to change depending on what clothes one was wearing. However, by the 1780’s, the new, “natural” style allowed one’s inner self to transcend their clothes (Wahrman).\\n\\nDuring the 1790s, there was a new concept of the internal and external self. Before this time, there had only been one self, which was expressed through clothing. When going to a masquerade ball, people wore specific clothing, so they could not show their individuality though their clothing. Since, for everyday dress, most people wore similar clothing, people used accessories to show their individuality. These accessories and the detail on the clothing were more important than the shape of the dress. (Wahrman)\\n\\nIncorporated in this new “natural” style was the importance of ease and comfort of ones dress. Not only was there a new emphasis on hygiene, but also clothing became much lighter and more able to be changed and washed frequently. Even upper class women began wearing cropped dresses as opposed to dresses with long trains or hoops that restricted them from leaving their homes. In a sense, women were influenced by male fashion, such as tailored waistcoats and jackets to emphasize women’s mobility. This new movement toward practicality of dress showed that dress no longer was a way to categorize between classes or genders; dress was meant to suit ones personal daily routine. (McNeil)
Vasari Plaster & Stucco manufactures and distributes plaster and stucco products. Vasari Plaster is a family owned business that started in 2003 in Bend, Oregon. In 2009 the factory and showroom relocated to Santa Barbara, California. They sell products premixed (wet mix) custom tinted, or ready to mix (dry mix). They ship products throughout North America and the world. Vasari is dedicated to producing the best possible wall finishes. Vasari is committed to environmental building practices. That is why they can help you achieve greater LEED points in buliding certification and most importantly give you the cleanest and freshest environment to play and work in. \\n\\nLime based wall finishes have been used for thousands of years. From the tombs of the Pyramids of Giza to the Sistine Chapel, lime stucco has been a key ingredient in great architecture on six continents for over 9000 years. Ancient Romans were thought to have perfected lime plasters to a higher art than previous cultures incorporating unlimited decorative elements. Fine plaster craft was lost for a thousand years until the Renaissance. Lime plasters were were widely recognized for their beauty, feel and longevity. Perhaps most importantly, it was the structural qualities that were most desired. Like Vasari products, lime plasters are breathable, water tolerant, absorb carbon dioxide, are naturally resistant to mildew and fungus, self healing on exteriors and easily repairable.\\n\\nOn June 6, 2011 Vasari's 5,000 square foot warehouse burned completely and the headquarters was moved a mile away. Vasari continues to thrive in Santa Barbara and hopes to replace all paint eventually with a much healthier and more beautiful alternative for all of us to live in.
'''Hippahauchi Mountain Lions'''\\n\\nThe Hippahauchi Mountain Lions are native to California. They are powerful, feline predator that had a spiritual connection with the indigenous tribes. It is said that the Hippahauchi Mountain Lions only reside in areas that previously belonged to the indian tribes of Northern California. As early American Settlers migrated in search of gold in the mid 1800's, the pioneers killed off the entire tribe. The last tribal chief made a pact with the Hippahauchi Mountain Lions to seek revenge on the white man. The most dangerous part about the predators is that you cannot feel your limbs being eaten away. You must check your arms and legs every morning when you wake up. Their ferocious attacks left thousands dead. To this day the government tries to keep this dangerous animal a secret to prevent a state of fear among the people. The government denies the existence of this animal and no pictures are available. '''BEWARE OF BEING FOUND IN WHITE OR ORANGE TENTS IN THE OUTDOORS!!!'''

Food insufficiency is a serious problem affecting children's ability to learn. Research indicates that school breakfast programs seem to improve attendance rates and decrease tardiness. Among severely undernourished populations, school breakfast programs seem to improve academic performance and cognitive functioning.\\nThe study seems to examine the relationship between academic of cognitive performance and eating breakfast in the morning. The author uses descriptive statistics in this study. The research was split into four different tables of data to show the results. The data was between children who took vitamins and ate breakfast and children who neither. They also used inferential statistics because they concluded the results based on a large group of children. The results describe the general performance of a student across a potentially wide range.\\n	The study seems to conclude that food insufficiency is a serious problem affecting children's ability to learn. School breakfast programs seem to improve attendance and decrease tardiness. Offering a healthy breakfast is an effective measure to improve academic performance and cognitive functioning among undernourished populations. Eating breakfast, in contrast to fasting, may improve performance on the morning eaten. Breakfast helps improve mental performance and concentration during morning activities. Children who skip breakfast will be more sluggish, less attentive, and have less energy to carry out their morning tasks. Teachers observe that children who come to school hungry experience more learning difficulties compared to well-nourished children. The study shows that breakfast eaters perform much better in their school work and show extra energy in sports and other physical activities. Besides assuring optimal development and growth, positive effects on alertness, attention, performance on standardized achievement tests, and other skills important for academic success are enhanced for those who eat breakfast on a daily basis. The long-term effects of eating breakfast on the performance of school children who do not have physical signs of severe undernourishment are less certain.
''''''ECHO FRIEND INDUSTRIES''''''\\n\\n''About e-Waste''\\n "Electronic waste" may be defined as all secondary computers, entertainment device electronics, mobile phones, and other items such as television sets and refrigerators, whether sold, donated, or discarded by their original owners. This definition includes used electronics which are destined for reuse, resale, salvage, recycling, or disposal. Others define the re-usables (working and repairable electronics) and secondary scrap (copper, steel, plastic, etc.) to be "commodities", and reserve the term "waste" for residue or material which was represented as working or repairable but which is dumped or disposed or discarded by the buyer rather than recycled, including residue from reuse and recycling operations. Because loads of surplus electronics are frequently commingled (good, recyclable, and non-recyclable), several public policy advocates apply the term "e-waste" broadly to all surplus electronics. The Environmental Protection Act (EPA) includes discarded CRT monitors in its category of "hazardous household waste" but considers CRTs set aside for testing to be commodities if they are not discarded, speculatively accumulated, or left unprotected from weather and other damage.\\n\\nDebate continues over the distinction between "commodity" and "waste" electronics definitions. Some exporters are accused of deliberately leaving difficult-to-recycle, obsolete, or non-repairable equipment mixed in loads of working equipment (though this may also come through ignorance, or to avoid more costly treatment processes). Protectionists may broaden the definition of "waste" electronics in order to protect domestic markets from working secondary equipment. The high value of the computer recycling subset of electronic waste (working and reusable laptops, desktops, and components like RAM) can help pay the cost of transportation for a larger number of worthless pieces than can be achieved with display devices, which have less (or negative) scrap value.
\\nKuru\\n\\n\\nKuru is a disease of the nervous system.\\n\\nCauses, incidence, and risk factors\\n\\nKuru is a very rare disease. It is caused by an infectious protein (prion) found in contaminated human brain tissue.\\n\\nKuru is found among people from New Guinea who practiced a form of cannibalism in which they ate the brains of dead people as part of a funeral ritual. This practice stopped in 1960, but cases of kuru were reported for many years afterward because the disease has a long incubation period.\\n\\nKuru causes brain and nervous system changes similar to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Similar diseases appear in cows as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also called mad cow disease.\\n\\nThe main risk factor for kuru is eating human brain tissue, which can contain the infectious particles.
\\n== '''A simple approach to terrorism''' by Dr.Tammam Ali AlBarmaki\\n\\n\\n'''Terrorism''' is the use of force or violence against persons or property for the\\npurpose of intimidation, coercion, or ransom. Terrorists often use\\nviolence and threats to create fear among the public, to try to convince\\npeople that their government is powerless to prevent acts of terrorism,\\nand to get immediate publicity for their causes.  Acts of terrorism can range\\nfrom threats to actual assassinations, kidnappings,building explosions, mailings of dangerous materials, agro- terrorism, computer-based attacks, and the use of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons—weapons of mass destruction (WMD). \\n\\n'''Another type is called hand-made terrorism''' which is utilized very perfectly in order to draw the attention of the strong nations and subsequently received support from them, this type is also described as seasonal terrorism and it is of two subtypes either primary that was not there before or secondary which is already existing and weak but is aggravated or stimulated by the government. And the cause for its aggravation or stimulation is either due to the government does not receive any support (any form of support) from those donor countries or the support which was done by these donor countries is now stopped. It seems that there is some agreement between the two parts, the government and the terrorist groups and the answer is Yes in the former and may be in the later.\\n\\nPeople face threats of terrorism posed by extremist groups, individuals, and hostile governments. Terrorists can be domestic or foreign, and their threats to people, communities, and the nation range from isolated acts of terrorism to acts of war. High-risk terrorism targets include military and civilian government facilities, international airports, large cities, and high-profile landmarks. Terrorists might also target large public gatherings, water and food supplies, utilities, and corporate centers. People become terrorist in different ways, in different roles, and for different reasons. Mental illness is not a contributing factor to these terrorist processes, it means that those terrorists are not psychopaths and there is not terrorist personality. History of childhood trauma , abuse, and themes of perceived injustice and humiliation  may make the person susceptible to be a terrorist but do not really help to explain terrorism. Terrorist groups, like all social collectives, have certain internal (e.g., mistrust, competition) and external (e.g. support, inter-group conflict) vulnerabilities to their existence. \\n\\nEffective leaders of terrorist organizations must be able to: maintain a collective belief system; establish and maintain organizational routines; control the flow of communication; manipulate incentives (and purposive goals) for followers; deflect conflict to external targets; and keep action going. \\n  \\nWe must know that terrorism is not an official state by itself otherwise it is called violence. In many Arab countries and in this current political situation and the spring of the ongoing Arab masses revolution. The acts done by the government against the protesters such as attacking them by any form as shooting them, poisoning them with poisonous weapons, or arresting them are not involved in the definition of terrorism, instead it is called violence against humanity and the innocents. I will not go deeply through this path but I try to concentrate hardly on the prevention and role of the governments in fighting terrorism.\\n\\n\\nJerrold Post has similarly theorized that “the need to belong, the need to have a stable identity, to resolve a split and be at one with oneself and with society- … is an important bridging concept which helps explain the similarity in behavior of terrorists in groups of widely different espoused motivations and composition.” \\n\\nBecause of the malicious behaviors and intentions of those terrorist groups all nations and states world wide stand together for fighting terrorism in all its forms.\\n\\n\\nThe United State and the European Unions play a major role in fighting terrorism through their partnership.\\nSince the end of the Cold War, the role of non-state actors forming transnational networks and adopting the methods of political violence associated with low intensity conflict and insurgency (e.g., bombings, kidnapping, assassinations, hostage taking, etc.) has increased, especially in geographic regions where governance is weak or non-existent.\\nThe American strategy has four main components to limit and fight terrorism:\\n\\n'''Defeat''' terrorist organizations of global reach; \\n\\n'''Deny''' further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists; \\n\\n'''Diminish''' underlying conditions that terrorists seek to exploit; \\n\\n'''Defend''' the homeland and extend defenses abroad.\\n\\n\\nAlso the European Union has its four main components to limit and fight terrorism:\\n\\n \\n\\n'''Prevent''' people turning to terrorism by tackling root causes; \\n\\n'''Protect''' citizens and infrastructure; \\n\\n'''Pursue''' and investigate terrorists and bring them to justice; \\n\\n'''Respond''' (prepare) to manage and minimize consequences of an attack\\n\\n\\nFirst the US sees the fight against terrorism as a "war". Consequently, there has been a heavy input from the Defense Department and armed forces in disrupting terrorist networks. As the State Department’s legal advisor has argued: \\n\\n[The United States was] clearly justified in using military force in self-defense against al-Qaida. Al-Qaida is not a nation state, but it planned and executed violent attacks with an international reach, magnitude, and sophistication that could previously be achieved only by nation states. Its leaders explicitly declared war against the United States, and al-Qaida members attacked our embassies, our military vessels, our financial center, our military headquarters, and our capital city, killing more than 3,000 people in the process. In our view, these facts fully supported our determination that we were justified in responding in self-defense, just as we would have been if a nation had committed these acts against us.\\n\\n\\nSecond, the US approach places an emphasis on the external. For the United States, the extraterritorial nature of the al-Qaida network (not to mention the Taliban government in Afghanistan, which harbored al-Qaida terrorists) led the Americans to view the threat’s external dimension. Consequently, the US approach consistently has been to “take the fight” to the enemy and push the borders out.\\nAs Dan Hamilton writes, “Despite the impact of September 11 on the United States, the natural instinct in a nation bounded by two oceans is still to fight one’s enemies abroad so one doesn’t need to fight them at home.” Thus, the focus of the American counterterrorism strategy has been to reach out to beyond Europe to the rest of world, including the Philippines, Russia, China, Pakistan, India, and Australia. As the National Counterterrorism Strategy states, “As our enemies exploit the benefits of our global environment to operate around the world, our approach must be global as well.” This is one reason why the US developed the Container Security Initiative.\\n\\n\\nThird, the US approach has been proactive. From an institutional perspective, the US created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and implemented major reform of the Intelligence Community in order to be better prepared for future threats.\\nEven if transatlantic threat perceptions vary somewhat, American and European officials generally agree on the threat and that it is real. A cursory comparison of the US national security strategy and EU security strategies is a case in point. According to the 2002 US National Security Strategy, global terrorism is a major threat to democratic regimes and the civilized world. The European Security Strategy of December 2003 lists terrorism as one of five key threats to the EU. The attacks in Madrid and London have helped European governments recognize that they are not immune. European intelligence officials believe that as many as thirty “spectacular” attacks have been planned since September 11. In October 2006, EU officials conducted a mock exercise to test their preparedness for a wave of terrorist attacks. In the exercise scenario, officials had to respond to a near-simultaneous terrorist attack in five EU cities. The purpose was to see how well EU institutions such as the Commission and Council Secretariat coordinate their various responses. According to Commission officials, the EU’s joint capacity was pretty good, although a review of the exercise highlighted the need for better use of communication technology. In March 2007, Europol released its first EU terrorism trends report, which stated that the terrorist threat to the EU is “more serious than ever.”\\nOne proposal put forward by the Europeans was to develop a “non-emotive lexicon” for discussing issues “in order to avoid linking Islam to terrorism.” Yet, in the same paragraph, the EU strategy talks about encouraging the “emergence of European imams” and engaging with “Muslim organizations and faith groups that reject the distorted version of Islam put forward by al-Qaida and others.”\\n\\n\\nThere is a strong link between the US department, EU department and the other government in the world for the purpose of fighting terrorism in all its forms either providing the government with any form of support to fight the terrorism by its own way or sharing the weak nations for fighting terrorism by military forces.\\n\\n\\nI would like to emphasize that terrorism is like HIV/AIDS, once some body is infected with it he /she will be exposed to many threats such as decrease his/her immunity and appearance of other infections and cancers which are the most common cause for death in patients infected with HIV. Likely the nations that are attacked by terrorism will be weak and said to be powerless if not all people stand together against this threat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'''References:\\n1.

== Crops ==\\n\\nRice is the most important cereal crop. In 1966 total rice production amounted to a little more than 1 million tons; by 1989 more than 3 million tons were produced.[1] Fluctuation in rice production was very common because of changes in rainfall; overall, however, rice production had increased following the introduction of new cultivation techniques as well as increases in cultivated land. By 1988 approximately 3.9 million hectares of land were under paddy cultivation.[1] Many people in Nepal devote their lives to cultivating rice to survive. In 1966 approximately 500,000 tons of corn, the second major food crop, were produced. By 1989 corn production had increased to over 1 million tons.[1]\\n\\n \\nA Nepalese coffee growerOther food crops included wheat, millet, barley, and coffee, but their contribution to the agricultural sector was small.[1] Increased production of cash crops, used as input to new industries, dominated in the early 1970s. Sugarcane and tobacco also showed considerable increases in production from the 1970s to the l980s. Potatoes and oilseed production had shown moderate growth since 1980. Medicinal herbs were grown in the north on the slopes of the Himalayas, but increases in production were limited by continued environmental degradation. According to government statistics, production of milk, meat, and fruit had improved but as of the late 1980s still had not reached a point where nutritionally balanced food was available to most people. Additionally, the increases in meat and milk production had not met the desired level of output as of 1989. Nepal has more than 50% of people engaged in agriculture. Food grains contributed 76 percent of total crop production in 1988-89. In 1989-90 despite poor weather conditions and a lack of agricultural inputs, particularly fertilizer, there was a production increase of 5 percent. In fact, severe weather fluctuations often affected production levels.[1] Some of the gains in production through the 1980s were due to increased productivity of the work force (about 7 percent over fifteen years); other gains were due to increased land use and favorable weather conditions. According to Statistical Information on Nepalese Agriculture (2008/2009) only 65.6% of people depends on agriculture and 21% of land is cultivated whereas 6.99% of land is uncultivated\\n     WRITTEN BY~ PRATIK BAHADUR ADHIKARI
== Save Your Planet through Metal Recycling ==\\n\\n“Two-thirds of the aluminum ever produced is still in use today” (earth911.com)<br />\\n“All steel cans are 100% recyclable” (wasteonline.org.uk)\\n\\nWhen you think of metal recycling, aluminum and steel is what generally comes to mind. But regretfully the fact of the matter is that the recycling rates of these 2 metals have been reduced by 20% over the past couple of years. Both aluminum scrap and steel scrap have a high recycling value. Thus the more these 2 metals are recycled at metal recycling companies, the more money and energy can be saved.\\n\\nHow products are made directly from ores (without recycling):\\n\\n• An ALUMINUM product is made by separating oxygen from aluminum extracted as a mineral. This is done by the application of an electric current that is passed through the metal. The metal is then melted and shaped into the desired product.<br />\\n• STEEL is made in a hot blast furnace with the help of different chemical reaction processes. Through this process oxygen is again separated from the ore. It is melted and then shaped.\\n\\nMillions of tons of energy are generally utilized if manufacturers were to make aluminum and steel products in this manner. But when you recycle, only 4% of this energy is used in the manufacturing process. \\n\\nBy recycling aluminum and steel:\\n\\n• You can prevent land, water and air pollution.<br />\\n• You can reduce the damages involved in the process of mining ores.<br />
Most foxes live 2 to 3 years but can survive for up to 10 years, or even longer, in captivity. With most species roughly the size of a domestic cat, foxes are smaller than other members of the family candiae, such as wolves, jackals, and domestic dogs.			A fox den is that the dirt excavated from the hole will be kicked out backwards, without much regard to placement. While a fox digs dirt like a dog, a groundhog will pat it neatly into a mound. The red fox prefer diverse habitat consisting of cropland, rolling farmland, brush, pastures, mixed hardwoods, and edges of open areas that provide suitable hunting grounds. Chaparral, wooded areas and among boulders on the slopes of rocky ridges in canyons and open desert.								Red foxes live in forests or temperate biomes. Red fox are in nearly every county of New York State and in many of the open spaces and parks of our cities and suburbs. Though red foxes prefer the pastures and meadows of farming country, they also are found in woodlands. Indeed they seem to prefer dens in forests or woodlots over those in open country.							Red foxes are solitary hunters who feed on rodents, rabbits, birds, and other small game but their diet can be as flexible as their home habitat. Foxes will eat fruit and vegetables, fish, frogs, and even worms. If living among humans, foxes will opportunistically dine on garbage and pet food. They den in hollow logs, beneath boulders, in ground burrows, or in hillsides.

Thorfinn Stainforth\\nDr. Hanlon\\nHanlon Research Paper II\\nMarch 10, 2003\\n\\nFamine in 17th Century Europe\\n	Famine had been a regular, unwelcome, occurrence in Europe for centuries before the seventeenth century. The cycle of good harvests, poor harvests and the resulting periods plenty, scarcity, or famine are a part of every peasant society. During the seventeenth century, in parts of Europe, this cycle began to end. Famines continued to recur regularly in most areas of Europe long after the seventeenth century, but in some areas they began to disappear in that century. This remarkable change was the result of improved agricultural techniques and the increasingly commercialized nature of agriculture in Europe. In areas where famines did still occur, a variety of social and governmental measures were used to mitigate the effects of those tough times.\\n	Agriculture dominated the European economy in the seventeenth century. The vast majority of the population was involved in the production and distribution of food.1 Most people on the continent were still subsistence level peasants.2 Although the economy was beginning to become more commercialized, as we shall see, most people still produced food for themselves and their landlord.\\n	Agriculture was dominated by the production of grain. A typical craftsman in the Low Countries around 1600 spent about 1/2 of his income on grain or bread.3 Grain was used to make bread which provided the bulk of almost every meal. There were many different kinds of grain produced, varying depending on the local climate and culture. Wheat was the most prized grain, due to its taste, texture, and colour, but it was generally unavailable to northern Europeans who had to settle for rye, oats, or a combination of grains. Wheat was not particularly more nutritious than either of these grains, and many northerners continued to prefer their traditional grains long after they were able to grow wheat reliably. Naturally, with such a dependence on grain, a poor harvest of the local staple grain could easily lead to famine. Many areas were heavily dependent on the one type of grain they chose to rely on, and were thus extremely vulnerable to crop failures.4 \\n	In some areas a dual crop system was developed that helped to alleviate some of the problems of over-reliance on one kind of grain. Wheat and rye were planted in autumn, harvested the next summer, while barley and oats could be planted in spring and harvested in autumn. If one crop failed, the other had the possibility of sustaining the population for the time it took to harvest another crop.5 Usually barley and oats were not so much grown for their bread making qualities, but in the case of barley for making drink, and in the case of oats to feed the livestock. Other refinements of agriculture helped to alleviate famine or dearth, but did not usually prevent it.\\n	Improvements in the field rotation system allowed peasants to use their land more frequently and efficiently . The “three field” system was adopted in many areas, an improvement over the medieval “two field” system. New crops were introduced from the Americas and elsewhere. Maize and potatoes were the most notable of the new crops. Maize was first introduced in the 1550s, but it took some time for it to become widely accepted.6 Maize was an extremely versatile crop and was eventually able to feed peasants even in the years with the worst harvests. In the course of the seventeenth century, potatoes also came into wide use. They were a phenomenon of northern Europe, and came to be the staple crop of the peasantry and urban poor.7 \\n	Fruits and vegetables were not well regarded by most of the population. However, during the seventeenth century they came to be eaten on a much more regular basis than they had previously, possibly as a result of the increased population of the time. Beans, cabbage, leeks, peas, sorrel, lettuce, endive, onions, melons, pumpkins, cucumbers, parsnips, carrots, cabbage, turnips, apples, pears, plums, cherries, and in some areas peaches, oranges, and lemons came to be eaten on a regular basis during the seventeenth century.8 Meat was available in northern Europe primarily in spring and autumn, the two slaughtering periods. Fish was available in areas close to the coasts, or on rivers with relatively quick access to the sea.\\n	The seventeenth century was a period of change for the food producers of Europe. For centuries they had lived primarily as subsistence farmers in a feudal system. They had obligations to their lords, who usually owned the land they worked. They shared the food that they produced with the lord in exchange for the use of the land. Peasants generally tried to minimize the amount of work they had to put into agricultural food production. Their lords rarely pressured them to increase their food output, except when the population started to increase, at which time the peasants were likely to increase the production themselves. More land would be added to cultivation until there was no more available and the peasants were forced to take up more labour intensive methods of production. None the less, they generally tried to work as little as possible, valuing their time to do other things such as hunting, fishing, or relaxing, as long as they had enough food to sustain their population.9 It was not in their interest to produce more than they could eat or store themselves.\\n	During the seventeenth century, continuing the trend of previous centuries, there was in increase in market driven agriculture. Farmers, people who rented land in order to make a profit off of the product of the land, employing wage labour, became increasingly common, particularly in western Europe. It was in their interest to produce as much as possible on their land in order to sell it to areas that demanded that product. They produced guaranteed surpluses of their crop every year if they could.10 Farmers paid their labourers in money, increasing the commercialization of rural society. This monetization had a profound impact on the behaviour of peasants. Farmers were interested in increasing labour input into their lands, not decreasing it as subsistence peasants were.\\n	Subsistence peasants were also increasingly forced to commercialize their activities because of increasing taxes. Taxes that had to be paid to central governments in money forced the peasants to produce crops to sell. Sometimes they produced industrial crops, but often they would find ways to increase their production in order to meet both their subsistence requirements as well as their tax obligations.11 Peasants also often used the new money to purchase manufactured goods.\\n	The agricultural and social developments encouraging increased food production were gradually taking place throughout the sixteenth century, but were spurred on more directly by the adverse conditions for food production that Europe found itself in in the early seventeenth century. There was a general cooling trend in the Earth’s temperature starting at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The 1590s saw the worst famines in centuries all across Europe, except in certain areas, notably the Netherlands.12 Famine had been relatively rare during the sixteenth century. The economy and population had grown steadily as subsistence populations tend to when there is an extended period of relative peace (most of the time). Subsistence peasant populations will almost always increase when possible since the peasants will try to spread the work to as many hands as possible.13  Although peasants in areas of high population density, such as northern Italy, had learned to increase the yields of their lands through techniques such as promiscuous culture,14  they were still often quite vulnerable to famines, forcing them to work their land even more intensively.\\n	Famine was a very destabilizing and devastating occurrence. The prospect of starvation led people to take desperate measures. When scarcity of food became apparent to peasants, they would sacrifice long term prosperity for short term survival. They would kill their draught animals, leading to lowered production in subsequent years. They would eat their seed corn, sacrificing next year’s crop in the hope that more seed could be found. Once those means had been exhausted, they would take to the road in search of food. They generally migrated to the cities where merchants from other areas would be more likely to sell their food. Cities had a stronger purchasing power than did rural areas.15 Cities also administered relief programs and bought grain for their populations so that they could keep order.16 With the confusion and desperation of the migrants, crime would often follow them. Many peasants resorted to banditry in order to acquire enough to eat. The countrysides and cities were especially dangerous in times of dearth or famine.\\n	There was little direct relationship between famine and disease.17 It has often been assumed that disease was directly related to periods of hunger, but Schofield believes that the two blights were generally unrelated, except as an extension of extended social disorder. None the less, famines were obviously extremely difficult times for the population. One famine would often lead to difficulties in following years because of lack of seed stock or disruption of routine, or perhaps because of less available labour. Famines were often interpreted as signs of God’s displeasure.18 They were seen as the removal, by God, of His gifts to the people of the Earth. Elaborate religious processions and rituals were  made to prevent God’s wrath in the form of famine.19 \\n	The great famine of the 1590s began the period of famine and decline in the seventeenth century. The price of grain, all over Europe was high, as was the population. Various types of people were vulnerable to the succession of bad harvests that occurred throughout the 1590s in different regions. The increasing number of wage labourers in the countryside were vulnerable because they had no food of their own, and their meager living was not enough to purchase the expensive grain of a bad crop year. Town labourers were also at risk because their wages would be insufficient to cover the cost of grain, and to make matters worse, they often received less money in bad crop years since the disposable income of the wealthy was spent on grain. Often unemployment would be the result of the increase in grain prices, leading to ever increasing numbers of urban poor. All areas of Europe were badly affected by the famine in these periods, especially rural areas.\\n	The Netherlands were able to escape most of the damaging effects of the famine, though the 1590s were still difficult years there. Van Deursen, a Dutch historian wrote, \\n\\nactual famine did not occur, for the Amsterdam grain trade [with the Baltic] guaranteed that there would always be something to eat in Holland... In Holland and in the Republic as a whole, people did not die of hunger... [though] dearth could become quite fearsome.20\\n\\n	The Netherlands had the most commercialized agriculture in all of Europe at this time. They grew many industrial crops such as flax, hemp, and hops. Agriculture became increasingly specialized and efficient. The efficiency of Dutch agriculture allowed for much more rapid urbanization in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries than anywhere else in Europe. As a result, productivity and wealth increased, allowing the Netherlands to maintain a steady food supply.21 By the 1620s the economy was even more developed, so the country was able to avoid the hardships of that period of famine with even greater impunity.\\n	The years around 1620 saw another period of famines sweep across Europe. These famines were generally less severe than the famines of twenty five years earlier, but they were none the less quite devastating in many areas. The harvest failures were devastating for the northern Italian economy. The economy of the area had recovered well from the previous famines, but the famines from 1618-21 coincided because of a period of war in the area. The economy did not recover fully for centuries.22 The economic downturn left the area less able to deal with famine than other areas such as the Netherlands. Italian agriculture began to lag behind Dutch agriculture in terms of commercial development and Italy continued to suffer from famines throughout the seventeenth century. There were serious famines in the late 1640s and less severely in the 1670s throughout northern Italy. Local famines continued to occur throughout the period, but were less devastating than harvest failures effecting larger areas.\\n	England also lagged behind the Netherlands, but by 1650 their agricultural industry was commercialized on a wide scale. The last peace-time famine in England was in 1623-24.23 There were still periods of hunger, as in the Netherlands, but there were no more famines. Enclosure of common pasture for private use and the consolidation of farms are two of the commercial developments of the time that are credited with helping England commercialize its agriculture.24 There were other developments, as in the Netherlands, such as the draining of marshes, more efficient field use patterns, and the wider introduction of industrial crops. These agricultural developments led to wider prosperity in England and increasing urbanization. In both England and the Netherlands the populations stabilized at about the same time that agriculture had been widely commercialized and the countries had escaped from the cycle of famine. \\n	Ronald Seavoy believes that the stabilization of the population, evident in both countries represents the successful commercialization of the agricultural economy.25 The Dutch population stabilized between 1650 and 1750,26 and so did the English.27 Seavoy believes that this is a reflection of the decreased value of children in commercialized economy. For a wage labourer a child is less valuable in an economic sense than for a subsistence peasant. The child will be expensive for the wage labourer to raise, and the child will not contribute very much to the family for many years, whereas for a peasant, the more children there are, the more helpers there are for food production. As a result, the number of births declines in a commercialized economy. The birth rate rose again after 1750 because of increasing industrialization which represents a factor independent of the behaviour of rural workers.\\n	Often enough, famines in early modern Europe were either caused by or severely compounded by war. Wars were very disruptive to international trade, often interfering with the delivery of goods. If an area was directly affected by war, such as Germany during the Thirty Years’ War, the results could be extremely serious.28 Troops would plunder food and destroy agricultural infrastructure. War could also be very serious for areas not directly affected by the war, but which were required to supply food to the army, or whose trade routes were disrupted.29 France suffered from very poor weather in 1692 and, compounded with the ongoing wars of Louis XIV, there was a serious famine.30 To some degree, wars also hampered the efforts of local administrations to alleviate the effects of famine.\\n	Since famines were very destabilizing for any society, it was in the interests of the governing power to prevent them. During the seventeenth century this was usually handled at a local level, even in highly centralized states such as France.31 Government had a lot of power over the conduct of business during this period and they used it as best they could during periods of famine. Tactics used included the prohibition of the export of grain from famine stricken areas. Nothing incited riots more than the sight of food being taken out of the affected areas.32 The governments also regulated the price and quality of bread. They regulated who could buy bread and when, insuring that the poor got bread as well as the rich.33 The main tool at the disposal of a local government was buying grain from somewhere else and distributing it to the population. This was very expensive, but often the only way to stave off complete starvation. The governments also established more long term measures designed to expand agricultural output of areas under their control such as encouraging land owners to expand their fields.\\n	There were some national programmes as well, where large states did exist. In both England and France there were fairly elaborate poor laws that were centrally guided. Although in both countries the laws were administered at a local level, they existed nationally. In France the national poor laws compelled all vagrants to return to their own home parish during times of famine.34  Then the local authorities would be responsible for charity.\\n	Local governments were usually reasonably successful at relieving the worst effects of famine. Famines were certainly still devastating, but often enough a government could keep the population fed where otherwise they might well have perished. They were often able to protect the cities from the worst effects of harvest failures, and often the peasants who flocked there in times of need.35  Sometimes, however, there was little that could be done given the state of agriculture in the area.\\n	There were measures that people could take on their own, beyond the obvious moves to increase agricultural output, to alleviate the problems that famines presented. It is now well established that rural peasants took measures to control the growth of their populations during times of hardship.36 Marriages were postponed to avoid births during times of poor harvests. Some people may have foregone marriage altogether. Children were given up, and there was also a significant rate of infanticide during periods of hardship. Even after hard times were over, replacement rates were often quite slow. These decisions on the part of peasants about their reproductive rate may well have had a greater effect on population than actual mortality from starvation or malnutrition.\\n	Famines were a fact of life in the seventeenth century as they had been since the beginning of agricultural society. The severity and number of famines rose in Europe during the seventeenth century due to the general cooling trend that was taking place then. At the same time, some European societies were beginning to show the way that Europe could escape peace time famine entirely. First the Netherlands, and then England freed themselves from the famine cycle through their use of new agricultural techniques, and above all, the commercialization and specialization of their agriculture. However, famine would continue to mark many areas of Europe, even in peacetime, until the 20th century. When famine did occur it sparked a number of responses from the population. Governments tried as best they could to deal with the situation, and the population would deal with the pressures in the only ways they knew how. Famines often had profound demographic effects on European societies. The economic effects were also profound. Often enough, famines were themselves reflections of economic and structural weaknesses in a society, but the famine would generally compound those problems, leading to even greater difficulties for that society. The grave problems that famines presented to European society continued to elicit many profound responses, including some that would ultimately lead to the end of peace-time famine in Europe.
Hi -- Great information about the US, but I wish you would not perpetuate the use of the phrase "Continental United States” as a term defining the 48 contiguous states.  It was once an accurate term before 1959 and the advent of Alaska’s transition from territory to the 49th state.  Yes, the term is still used a great deal, but for those of us in Alaska it creates confusion and further feelings of being treated as stepchildren of the rest of the United States.  Alaska IS a part of the continent, and to refer only to the lower 48 as continental is not accurate.  Confusion occurs when companies offer shipping to the US or to the Continental US, but sometimes they mean 48 of the Continental US and sometimes they mean all 49 of the Continental United States.  When a person searches through a web site, tries to place an order and then finds out shipping is not available it is discouraging.  Elimination of the term continental US as meaning only 48 of the 49 continental states would clear up many problems.  Thank you for taking the time to read this and to at least reconsider your meaning of the phrase. Thanks from a life long Alaskan – both before and after statehood.

{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n\\nIn 2006 forty four of the largest U.S food industries spent about 2billion dollars on advertising, which mainly consisted of unhealthy, sugary and fatty foods. Such massive advertising has a detrimental effect on children and it heavily influences their diets. Extensive research proves that most of the food consumed between ages of 2-18 is low in nutrients. Facing a lot of pressure from health industries and laws, such as Children's Food and Beverage Advertising initiative, food marketers were forced to tweak and limit their advertising strategies. Despite regulations, a 2009 report shows that three quarters of all food advertising during children's television programs were outside of law's boundaries. Government attempts to put a heavy burden on food marketers in order to prevent the issue, but food marketers enjoy the benefits of the First Amendment which limits government's power to prevent advertising against children. Federal Trade Commission states that children between the ages of 2-11 on daily average see 15 food based commercials on television. Most of these commercial involve high sugar and high fat foods, which adds to the problem of childhood obesity.

'''CSSDP''' The [[Canadian Students for Sensible Drug Policy]] is a national, grassroots, youth and student network. We provide the necessary education and resources to empower chapters formed by youth and students to work on substance use issues facing their community. Chapters do everything from peer and public education, to drug policy reform and harm reduction projects. In all these areas we support an approach scientifically studied and proven to be effective in decreasing the negative impact of drugs and drug policies on individuals, families and communities. '''Harm Reduction Policies''' ''Drugs are a Health issue''. All policies and programs aimed at reducing the harms associated with drug use in society should address the issue as a public health concern, not as a criminal justice issue. This has been proven to be more effective by studies worldwide.  '''Education''' ''Accessibility'' The Centre for Excellence in Youth Engagement has found that drug education and prevention programs that meet young people where they are at, even if they are using drugs and [[alcohol]], are the most effective.Education programs like DARE, run by the Police, may be effective in reminding youth that drugs are illegal. However, they have been highly ineffective in seriously reaching young people about drugs in their personal lives. ''Honest, Open Dialogue'' Drug education is an empowerment. Young people should be provided with all the information available and encouraged to make their own decisions about their physical and mental health. All education should acknowledge and respect young people’s personal experience, a discussion that should be approached only in a space of compassion and non-judgment.
  l. Sending Zealots to DeathsDear Editor: The recent talk by the pope given in an academic setting has set the world on fire. Muslims have gone on a rampage, murdering priests and nuns and attacking churches. If this is done out of religious zeal, the perpetrators put their religion in a bad light. If it is condoned by the Muslim clergy, they do a disservice to all Muslims. Clergy, whether Christian or Muslim, are human. They are not immune to temptation or error. However, if they are acting contrary to the tenets of their religion, their superiors or colleagues should correct them. We know that the slaughter visited on Muslim civilians by fellow Muslims in Iraq is inconsistent with the teaching of the Koran. I have read and reread the Koran searching for anything that will justify the practice of teaching children that Allah will reward them if they strap explosives around their body, go into a market place, board a bus or enter a restaurant and blow themselves up, killing and maiming fellow Muslims. It appears that some Imams are involved in promoting this practice. If this is a worthy endeavor, when will we see an Imam become a martyr? It is time for Imams and Muslim leaders to denounce their brethren who perpetrate, or approve, these atrocities and purge their ranks of those who violate the commands of Allah and employ the tools of Satan in their nefarious work.If this is a legitimate tactic in a holy war, it is time for an Imam or two to come forward and blow themselves up for the cause. Why do they not join the young suicides in the sacrifice of their lives?\\n  \\n \\nFrancis J. Donovan

This paragraph needs to be re-written before being included as it contains a significant misconception. The tank does not create a "zero gravity" environment and the bit about "where gravity is and in which direction" is poorly worded. It is, however, correct that the brain does use a high proportion of its energy to maintain muscle contractions for balance but this is done subconciously so there is no space to "free [the brain] to attend to other matters". I'm sure there are many potential benefits from relaxation such as this but it would be better to leave out the incorrect use of scientific concepts such as gravity in this case. \\n\\n== Gravity ==\\n\\nDue to the high salt levels in the water, the floatation tank creates a zero gravity environment. Zero gravity allows the user to relax every single muscle: neck, arms, back and even ears. The tank enables the user to find those areas which are being held tense so they can be relaxed. Finding where gravity is and in which direction, then computing how the body can move and not fall over, takes about 90% of the brain's activity on a daily basis. Dr. Lilly's theory explains that when a user gets into the floateria capsule, the brain and body are free from all the gravity computations and the physical world. This leaves the brain free to attend to other matters.
Antartica is a quite "primitive" country. It is uncivilized (to some extent) however, there are a select few who still inhabit this age-old "block of ice". As of 5:46 P.M. central time, April 21st, 2007, the country was conquered and is now under the sole responsibility of Richard Smith, a native to the United States. He is currently requesting any help that anyone will gladly offer; fundage is a most significant point of focus. If you have any talent(s) whatsoever, such as repairing lawn mowers, making cheese sandwiches, eating peanut butter, etc., you can help him in his attempt to develop a more advanced civilization. You will be gladly granted citizenship in your effort towards making Antarctica a better place to live. Polar bear wranglers are another necessity we ask for. Much of the past civilization (1 out of 3 people) have been eaten by polar bears. It was only one bear that has been a pain in the ass, but still, come on, we can't have that.

The Quest for Environmental Justice in the National Park System\\n\\n=== Introduction === \\nFrom its inception, the national park system had the dual goal of improving conservation of natural resources and creating places of enjoyment for the public and future generations. Currently, in 2012 there are over 10,000 protected areas around the world, with 365 national parks located in the United States alone (Tilden 1951:13). In light of the prevalence of protected environmental areas worldwide, it is important to assess the social as well as environmental impacts of the creation of national parks. Little attention has been placed on evaluating the extent to which environmental justice is achieved within the park system, which is of particular concern as bioprospecting efforts and forced relocations of indigenous populations increase. \\n\\n\\nEnvironmental justice within national parks primarily concerns locals’ access rights, which are dictated by the political and social institutions that govern protected areas. The EPA defines environmental justice as, “The fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies” (Miller et al. 2003:G5). Given the EPA’s definition, environmental justice necessitates the involvement by local populations in the national park system. Yet limited access rights and restricted management participation, in addition to ideological legacies of national parks that stem from Eurocentric views of the environment, have made it challenging to achieve environmental justice fully. To facilitate scholarly discussion about environmental justice within the national park system, the central issues that obstruct justice will be presented, followed by methods to overcome these obstacles to achieve the multifaceted goal of promoting conservation, sustainability, and recreation fairly for all populations. \\n\\n=== The Establishment of National Parks ===\\n \\n==== Motives ==== \\nThere is some debate about the true intentions behind creating national parks. While some historians assert that the national parks were developed with altruistic intentions of ecological preservation and wildlife protection (Kuo 2012:728), biodiversity protection and conservation (Cernea 2006:1809), and out of closeness with nature, the actual motives for creating land preservations may have been much darker. Other historians, ecologists, and anthropologists contend that the national park system arose because certain land was not profitable as a source of agricultural or timber production (Kuo 2012:728). \\n\\nWarwick Frost and Michael Hall claimed that the motivation for the creation of the national park varied between different countries to fit each country’s needs (Frost et al. 2009:357). While national parks were set up to promote outdoor recreation in countries like the United States and Canada, the underlying factor for creation of the parks however, is purely economic (Frost et al. 2009:357). The notion of the national park relied primarily on the perceptions of “worthless land (for large scale mining or agricultural production), tourism’s economic value on the land, and an acute demand for places for public enjoyment” (Frost et al. 2009:357). Robert Turner, in Market Failures and the Rationale for National Parks, asserts that national parks were established in order to create a sense of national identity, and to protect important historical and ecological resources (Turner 2002:350). Although he notes that national parks successfully preserve ecosystems, conserve biodiversity, protect wildlife, and safeguard native cultures, he ultimately argues that market failures (i.e. unprofitable land) are used as justification for national parks (Turner 2002:347-350).  \\n\\n==== Western Ideologies of the Environment ==== \\nDiffering views toward the environment and peoples’ role within it, dictates the way that land is utilized and managed. As Dahlberg, Rohde, and Sandell astutely observed, “Conservation of protected areas is primarily about how we perceive such landscapes, how we place differential values on different landscape components, and who gets to decide on these values” (Dahlberg et al. 2010:209). Thus, society’s perception of the environment, as well as the social and political institutions that decide which landscapes to protect, play significant roles in the determination of national park regions. \\nWestern ideologies regarding the environment typically neglected the interplay between man and forest, and portrayed nature as pristine and untouched by local populations. The areas that received attention as natural environments worthy of protection were those that were free of human activity, and there was general disregard for the significance of the relationship indigenous populations maintained with the land (Dahlberg et al. 2010:210).\\n\\n\\nThe Eurocentric view of pristine nature and wilderness dictated which lands were ultimately selected as national parks. The National Park Service sought to “Preserve, in a condition as unaltered as is humanly possible, the wilderness that greeted the eyes of the first white men who challenged and conquered it,” said Freeman Tilden (Tilden 1951:417). Tilden’s remarks accurately depict the white elitist views that shaped the park system. Tilden highlights the point that, according to traditional Western ideologies, nature is seen juxtaposed with mankind, and minority populations are considered to be submissive to whites. This tainted perception of the relationship between indigenous populations and the environment severely limited local access to the land, because white elitists looked down upon locals’ dependence on the environment and their use of natural resources (Frost et al. 2009:357). Since the institutions and sectors of society that possessed the most power were predominately white, Western ideologies formed the basis for the national park system and continue to impede environmental justice because the basic principles the park system was founded upon were unjust. \\n\\n=== Forced Displacement of Indigenous Populations ===\\nOne of the most difficult obstacles to environmental justice in the national park system lies in the fact that indigenous populations, who both lived on and shaped the land, are forced to relocate if their territory is selected for a national park citing. This unfair eradication of local communities results in local communities bearing a disproportionate cost of conservation (MacKenzie 2012:93).\\nDisplaced populations face a slew of economic, social, and political problems. Compulsory removal processes leave locals without their land, homes, and source of income. The lifestyles of local communities that revolved around hunting and gathering, for example, cannot be altered instantaneously. Compensation for displacement is rarely commensurate with the value of all that is lost during relocation, and this unfairly hurts the livelihoods of locals. \\n\\nForced displacements additionally strip locals of their connection with the land and along with it, their cultural identity. Displaced individuals face the risk of marginalization by society, especially when they relocate to regions with different cultural, social, and economic backgrounds (Cernea 2006:1829). In addition to these social ramifications, locals are further disempowered by the denial of both human rights and positions of authority as managers of national parks. Community members are endowed with the right to utilize and live on land that they inhabited for hundreds of years, and they have the right to be justly compensated should they decide to relocate for the creation of a national park. However, the social institutions that protect the rights of local communities are lacking and require improvement (Cernea 2006:1829). \\nAdditionally, forced displacement of indigenous populations negatively impact biodiversity. The livelihoods of local communities depends on natural resources found in the park, and there is a tendency for displaced individuals to return to national parks to continue to hunt and gather food, even though it is now illegal for them to do so. Also, evicted persons contribute to unsustainable resource use outside of national parks by putting stress on the environment and ecological resources in already overpopulated regions (Cernea 2006:1828). Given the risks to biodiversity posed by forced relocations, it seems only logical to protect both the human rights of communities and the environment, by halting coerced displacements. As Cernea advocated, the forced relocations, “that destroy people’s livelihood and trample on their human rights should not be done” (Cernea 2006: 1829).\\n\\n=== Environmental Racism === \\nEnvironmental racism occurs when minority populations are unfairly exposed to contamination, pollution, and degraded environments due to their race and inferior political and economic status. In light of current opinions which claim national park land was selected based on the economic uselessness of land and originated from a white elitist perception of nature, it comes as no surprise that environmental racism plays a role in the obstruction of justice in the park system. \\n\\nThe Eurocentric ideologies that shaped the formation of protected areas do not promote local engagement or increase community benefits. Cernea makes this point eloquently; “Science and nationalism have been employed by powerful elites to justify exclusion and control of national parks” (Cernea 2006: 1808). Land belonging to poor and marginalized communities was targeted for situating national parks by elites who disregarded rights of locals, and locals were further disempowered by displacement from their homeland (Cernea 2006:1827). Moreover, while whites benefited from the creation of national parks, other minorities bore disproportionate costs of conservation. “For the white elite, national parks and other protected areas became popular for recreational purposes and access opportunities increased; The management structures of national parks worked to alienate black people from land and landscapes that had previously been part of their identity and knowledge base” (Ramutsindela 2004:1). \\nWhile some nations including the United States, sought to develop a sense national identity through the development of national parks, minority communities were stripped of identities that they developed over centuries of inhabiting the land. \\n\\nLocals who are displaced by national parks do not enjoy the same economic and political status, or overall wellbeing as other parts of society. Resettlers face increased morbidity and mortality from exposure to more different diseases, compounded by the fact that they are less able to pay for expensive medical care (Cernea 2006:1826). For example, in the Botwa population in Africa, the child mortality rate was a staggering 47.7% in 2004; triple that of Uganda’s national average of 14.1% (Cernea 2006:1826). \\n\\n=== Poverty === \\n\\nForced resettlements of local populations upon park establishment inflicted poverty and caused negative ramifications for locals, compromising the quest for conservation and biodiversity. Displacement of local populations expels individuals from their source of income and diminishes their standards of living. Studies conducted by Michael Cernea found that the majority of displaced people went on to find marginalized jobs that did not pay well and were further impoverished by lack of compensation by the park system (Cernea 2006:1820-1824). Moreover, research conducted in Africa found that more than 80% of the displaced Batwa population remained uncompensated for their loss of land and did not have homes after six years of displacement (Cernea 2006:1828).\\n\\nCernea criticizes the national park system for its lack of regard for the economic and social costs from the creation of preservation areas, and he promotes the concept of double sustainability which entails a dual pursuit of people’s livelihoods and biodiversity (Cernea 2006: 1808-1830). One flaw in the national park system is that it tends to pay attention only to the environment, while it disregards the role indigenous populations maintain with nature and the social and economic effects of park development. \\n\\n=== Ecotourism === \\nEcotourism is touted as a green industry and has its roots embedded in the formation of the national park system (Frost et al. 2009:729). This form of tourism focuses on nature and aims to improve conservation and sustainability while fostering an appreciation for cultural heritage. Despite the potential monetary and environmental benefits of ecotourism, there are also negative impacts that accompany this market practice. \\nEcotourism’s altruistic goals are often compromised by “demand for access, construction of tourism facilities, and the wide spread ill-behavior of visitors” (Frost et al. 2009:729). The increasing development of land that was set aside for the sake of preservation, defeats the purpose of creating the national park in the first place. Moreover, increasing populations and stresses on natural resources prohibit national parks from fully achieving conservation. This calls into question the “applicability of the national park concept,” because if the system does not adequately further conservation and an appreciation for nature, then the system could be deemed a failure (Frost et al. 2009:729). Despite Burnett and Bulters’ positive views on the national park system regarding conservation, these authors affirmed the inherent problem in using the national park as a development (tourism) tool for its preservation objectives (Burnett et al. 1987:41). Too often, economic incentives overtake ecological goals of conservation thereby defeating the purpose of the park system. \\n\\nCernea similarly voices concern over ecotourism. Despite ecotourism’s reputation as something that promotes biodiversity and conservation efforts, it rarely generates benefits that outweigh the costs of increased tourism. “The most recent GEF study recognized about such assumed ecotourism benefits that ‘it is highly unlikely that revenue from wildlife and tourism will ever constitute a particular large source of income for all members of a community’” (Cernea 2006:1827). Furthermore, the stark disregard for indigenous people’s role in the environment and their lack of political influence in developing and managing parks, leave local communities disempowered.  \\n\\n=== Bioprospecting === \\nBioprospecting is the commercial use of biological resources and traditional knowledge in the development of new products (Hayden 2003:359). Bioprospecting has become more prevalent worldwide as scientists and pharmaceutical companies endeavor to uncover biological resources and develop new ways to utilize fauna and flora. However, there is often failure by commercial companies and scientists to properly compensate or recognize the contributions from locals’ knowledge. Today, more and more large companies and research groups view national parks as potential bioprospecting sources, which calls into question the role national parks should play in supplying commercially exploitable resources to these entities.\\n\\nProponents of bioprospecting in national parks view the parks as a library of environmental knowledge and resources (Jansen et al. 1998:39). The knowledge and information that could be obtained within national parks might, according to bioprospecting supporters, greatly benefit society. Furthermore, in order to properly preserve the geologic features within the parks, it is necessary to have an in depth understanding of its resources and this necessitates scientific research. \\n\\nIn addition to the appeal of scientific information that could provide useful products and tools for society, economic incentives also entice the Park Service to encourage bioprospecting efforts. Poor funding and commercial pressures from companies and research facilities make it increasingly difficult for the Park Service to deny bioprospecting companies’ access to the parks’ biological resources (Jansen et al. 1998:44). These unexpected monetary gains from national parks’ resources appear to be an additional benefit, but in reality, income from bioprospecting is usually small, and by engaging in bioprospecting, national parks fail to uphold their duties as places of conservation and public enjoyment. \\n\\n==== The Case of Bioprospecting in Yellowstone ==== \\nControversy surrounding bioprospecting in national parks is especially evident in the case of Yellowstone National Park. As the first national park in the world, Yellowstone is expected to provide an example of the qualities a national park should possess. Notably, the goals of the national park system are to preserve scenery, natural resources, and aid conservation in a “natural and unimpaired state for the benefit and inspiration of all people” (Jansen et al. 1998:45). Bioprospecting in Yellowstone however, compromised the aforementioned goals. \\nIn 1997 Yellowstone National Park signed an agreement with the biotechnical company, Diversa, to allow Diversa to collect organisms from thermal pools in search of commercially exploitable products (Doremus 1991:407-409). In exchange for access to Yellowstone’s resources, Diversa would pay Yellowstone $20,000 per year plus royalties from revenues generated by the bioprospecting products (Doremus 1991:409). However, the financial costs were twice as much as the cash return to Yellowstone, and in 1998 plaintiffs from the Edmonds Institute sued the Park Service for not preparing an Environmental Impact Statement before allowing Diversa to carry out bioprospecting in Yellowstone (Doremus 1991:411). This private expropriation of public resources was considered inappropriate (Jansen et al. 1998:45), and opponents viewed it as, “the kind of science the Park Service should not permit” (Doremus 191: 477).  \\n\\nFinancial incentives from bioprospecting dilute the goals of the national park system. While the argument that bioprospecting encourages conservation and a better understanding of the natural resources in national parks sounds appealing, no economic inducement should be necessary to protect national parks (Doremus 1999:401). National parks were originally created in order to promote conservation and foster a meaningful relationship between man and the environment – not for exploitation of natural resources. The paradigm shift from regarding parks as a place of conservation, to a place of economic gain, defeats the innate purpose of setting aside land as a protected area. Furthermore, it could create a slippery slope where the Park Service has no choice but to sell the parks’ biological resources in order to generate enough revenue to keep the parks up and running. Therefore, bioprospecting should be prohibited in national parks so that they may fulfill their original intentions of preserving the environment and wildlife for generations to come.  \\n\\n=== Local Access Rights ===\\nLocal indigenous populations too often lose their access to and ability to utilize land after it has been designed as a national park. Stemming back to the Eurocentric view of the environment as something pristine and untainted by mankind, the institutions that established protected areas sought to curtail locals’ utilization of the land. Unfortunately, this negatively impacted indigenous livelihoods because of the locals’ reliance on natural resources including forests, fish, and other game. “Local communities can perceive the loss of access to these [national parks] lands as limiting their ability to survive and building economies based on natural resource extraction from, or agricultural development, of these protected areas” (MacKenzie 2012:93). While individuals who are forced to relocate obviously have restricted access to cultivatable lands, they can also be prohibited in using the land and its resources in their traditional way. Restricted access, Cernea argues, is another form of forced displacement and severely hurts locals’ livelihoods (Cernea 2006:1809).  \\n\\n=== Room for Improvement === \\nDespite the aforementioned issues that make it difficult to achieve environmental justice for local populations, there are many ways the National Park Service can improve local’s access to the environment, decrease forced relocations, improve benefit sharing, limit impoverishment of displaced locals, halt bioprospecting, while concomitantly preserving the environment and fostering an appreciation of nature for the general public. These solutions require increased local involvement in the decision-making processes regarding national parks, and a restructuring of the political and social institutions that govern the parks. Environmental justice will only be achieved once a paradigm shift occurs that transitions away from the Eurocentric ideology of pristine nature, toward another that recognizes the interplay between the environment and indigenous populations. The following measures will help achieve these goals: \\n\\n	\\n* Reform the ideological contexts that dictated the way conservation efforts evolved. Recognize the different ways people view the environment and acknowledge the historical and cultural values of local populations.   \\n* 	Safeguard indigenous livelihoods by avoiding involuntary displacement operations that impoverish locals (Cernea 2006:1808).  \\n* 	Increase revenue sharing to benefit local communities while improving conservation efforts (MacKenzie 2012:93-97).   \\n* 	Provide more benefits to the locals who lost more due to the development of the park, instead of distributing compensation homogenously (MacKenzie 2012:93).  \\n* 	Halt bioprospecting in national parks in order to safeguard natural resources and local knowledge, without compromising the National Park System’s original goals to further conservation.   \\n* 	Include local communities in the process of establishing, planning, and developing national parks to provide them with the same political and human rights as other sectors of society.   \\n* 	Conservation agencies should be denied funds so long as they do not enact social safeguards to protect local communities from forced displacements from parks. These safeguards include policies consistent with those developed by the World Bank (Cernea 2006:1830).  \\n* 	Pursue double sustainability that protects both people’s livelihoods and natural resources, instead of focusing solely on the biological side (Cernea 2006:1830).  \\n\\n\\n\\nBurnett, G Wesley, and Lisa Mathis Butler\\n    1987 National Parks in the Third World and Associated National Characteristics.    \\n    Leisure Sciences, 9(1): 41.\\n\\nCernea, Michael M, and Kai Schmidt-Soltau. \\n     2006 Poverty Risks and National Parks: Policy Issues in Conservation and  \\n    Resettlement.

Mental/Squad Telepathy\\n          Mental telepathy has also been   referred to as "Squad Telepathy." \\nThe first origins were from Ancient Rome, when philosophers such as Aristotle\\n and Copernicus observed such patterns. They noticed that they had many of\\n the same ideas as the other philosophers that they associated with. Not much\\n was said or documented about these claims, as it was waved off as a coincidence.\\n Later, in the Renaissance, more philosophers noticed evidence of mental telepathy,\\nalso known as squad telepathy. It was documented for the first time during the\\n Renaissance by Galileo, when he conducted experiments with local peasants,\\n Knights, and even royalty. What he found was shocking. Some people are said\\n to have a certain gift of squad telepathy. These select few tend to have a few\\n common qualities. They have a strong connection with themselves, their associates,\\n the world around them, and a great sense of humor. Approximately ninety percent \\nof these subjects were also in excellent physical condition.\\n          Many modern studies have been conducted at the University of Miami and the\\n College of Notre Dame, where squad telepathy is very prevalent. The most recent case\\n was in a Notre Dame student in 1997. No since cases have been documented, but going\\n along with mental telepathy trends, a new "mind reader" is born approximately every\\n twenty years.
Chemistry is defined as the branch of science, which deals with the study of composition, structure and properties of matter and the changes, which the matter undergoes under different conditions and the laws which govern these changes. In fact the whole universe is made up of only two things\\ni.e. Matter and energy.\\nExperience has shown that all types of matter is defined as anything that occupier space, posses mass and the presence of which can be felt by any one or more of our five senses. The examples of matter are innumerable. A few of these include clothes, iron, gold, plastics, wood, milk, petrol, oil, air etc.
'''The Environmental impact of Uranium mining in Namibia'''\\n\\n[[Rossing Uranium Mine]] is owned by [[Rio Tinto Group]], the world’s largest mining group, which has annual Profits of over $1.4 billion.  It supplies enriched yellow cake uranium to power stations in France, UK, USA and Japan. The open-cast mine opened in 1976 and it has now been decided that the mine will close with the next few years. The company had an option of spending $100 million and expanding the mine, or closing down all operations by the year 2007; it close the latter. The mine also provides employment for 800 local people. In a country like [[Namibia]] which suffers from a severe lack of water, and has an annual rainfall of less than 30mm, that is a real probe Although mining causes environmental damage, these problems do not necessarily disappear with the closure of the mine. There are many dangerous waste products which would need to be disposed of and many methods that have been used at other mines in the past have been in effectual. Namibia is one of the African countries with a good environment compared to other countries.\\n\\nEvery prospecting and mining operation needs to comply with an environmental management plan (EMP), which is an outgrowth of the assessment of its environmental impacts (EIA). An EIA is mandatory before a prospecting or mining license is granted, and the EMP defines the activities that the operation must undertake to minimize environmental damage. The environmental impact of uranium mining in Namibia has also change the environment as Uranium mining is polluting the environment.  The uranium mining activities are done in the [[Namib-Naukluft National Park]], and this has even worried the Topnaar communities and has expressed their concern over the ongoing prospecting and mining of uranium in all areas that are protected because of their unique flora and fauna.  Mining in protected area is a threat to conservation of the desert and its living organisms.  The government should not give out too many prospecting licences, the Topnaar chief cautioned (New Era Oct. 13, 2008) mining uranium does not only possess health hazards but also environmental concerns such as water contamination, one of the serious issues that have not been addressed properly ( New Era April 21, 2005).\\n\\nAll the Namib uranium mines will bring ore to the surface, crush it, extract the valuable uranium and return the waste to the ground as rock piles or tailings dams or in-filled pits. A common denominator in all these operations is dust. Tons and tons of it – liberated at the surface and exposed to the desert winds. We all know that strong Namib winds pickup and carry dust over hundreds of kilometers, and some of this will blow over towns such as [[Swakopmund]], [[Arandis]] and [[Walvis Bay]]. How significant is this problem? It is difficult to tell, as the uranium mineral car notate can be found naturally on the surface of the gravel plains at Trek kopje, so we should not be surprised to find some of that material in the air.  \\n\\nThe activities that are being done at park is experiencing environmental effects from uranium prospecting and possibly in the future mining and what will happen to the tourism industry in the Namib when mining activities takes place ? Tourists will not want to visit the areas that are near mines or prospecting because of the visual scars on the landscape, noise and dust pollution.  Sensitive desert plants are being destroyed.  The levels of dust, itself being a problem, as well as the radioactive particles that it might carry, will be elevated by all this mining activity. Groundwater contamination Rössing is proud to proclaim that it has adequate measures in place to detect and prevent any spillage or leakage.\\n\\n'''Minimizing the risks'''\\n\\nThese five aspects reflect the biggest changes that could be inflicted upon us. Irrespective of how much you may want to keep Swakopmund or the Namib ‘as you knew it before’, it is going to be changed by uranium mining, so we should get used to the idea and make a positive contribution to the changes. One way could be to motivate for, and get involved in, a strategic planning exercise which spells out the various scenarios and provides options for how to guide or plan those scenarios better. For example, we might consider a zoning exercise in which certain high-value areas (for biodiversity, tourism or wilderness) would be forbidden for mining, as has been done in the Sperrgebiet. Certain areas and routes, already heavily disturbed, could be ear marked as the future desalination foci and the corridors for pipelines power lines that would serve the region at large. Social growth scenarios could be planned, including the growing need for domestic water, waste management and health services. Environmental monitoring stations could be set up to record possible pollutants and health statistics for the region as a whole could provide indicators of the effectiveness of radiation safety precautions.\\n \\n[[Uranium mining]] can be an economically and environmental accepted method for extracting uranium. Environmental impact in uranium mining has also advantages of such as lower capital and operating costs which required much smaller workforce, and the limited environmental impact as no waste lock, no tailing, and lower consumption of water.  One’s long-held impression of mines may be that they profess to bring great economic benefit to a country, yet deep down they are unconcerned with the environmental damage they inflict. Early indications, from the thoroughness of their EIAs, are that they operate on principles of transparency and responsibility to our natural and social environment. The proof of their commitment to make a net positive impact to this country will be seen in how effectively they prevent environmental damage arising from their cumulative activities. \\n\\nUser: Shikomba 21037319 | Shikomba 21037319 ([[User talk: Shikomba #top|talk]] ) 13:25, 16 May 2012 (UTC)\\n\\n== References ==\\n* Environmental Evaluation Associates of Namibia by: John Pallet\\n* Barnard Phoebe (ed) 1998 Biological Diversity of Namibia\\n* Uranium mining in Namibia” The mystery behind low level radiation by: H Shindondola-Mote\\n* Guidebook on Environmental impact Assessment for in Situ leach mining project (IAEA-TECDOC- 1428)\\n* Namibian Newspaper: uranium mining versus tourism, biodervisty by: Ndeshi Shiviya and Michelle Fourier (19 March 2012)\\n\\n\\n[[Wikipedia:School and university projects/Polytechnic of Namibia]]\\n\\n~~Liina K.

21st Century Network was set up to discuss some of the great issues of our millennium and bring back the hope that we can do something about it. This is a group for those who believe that we need to develop a new form of humanism that includes people of all religions and none but who embrace humanistic values as the basis of their actions. These are values of global compassion, personal self-discovery, shared development, planetary concern and a love of community. One commentator states,\\n\\n"I think this group has the potential to make a very important contribution on a number of global challenges that are and will affect our lives in the future. By inviting members of the public, NGO practicioners, policy makers and government representatives to these meetings the group could become an important think tank on a number of issues fostering important linkages between the state and civil society in Britain and beyond. Join this group and be part of this process."
== Introduction ==\\nWith snow avalanches, there is little that it will not take with it. Rocks, soil, trees, ice and the debris of anything that gets in its way. Avalanches interrupt transportation, destroy buildings, pylons and transmission towers and can ruin the reputation and economy of otherwise desirable settlements. The economic cost of prevention and reaction to all these impacts is considerable, but more importantly the human cost is often high and many people are injured or killed in avalanche related accidents every year.\\n\\nOne of the largest avalanche disasters in recent history occurred in February 1999 when a single avalanche in [[Galtur_Avalanche | Galtür]] cost thirty-eight people their lives (Thompson 1999). The heavily populated mountain ranges of Europe are often where the effects of avalanches are most serious. In the Alps approximately 120 people are killed every year. In some years the death toll is even higher. For example, in 1951, 98 people were killed in Switzerland and, in 1954, 143 people were killed in Austria alone (McClung and Schaerer 1993). Little was known about the physics of avalanches or how to predict them back then in the fifties so these disasters were very difficult to forecast. Fifty million people now go skiing every year (Holdsworth 1998) so it is clear that we need to know when avalanches are going to occur so we can act proactively and save lives and money rather than waiting for the avalanches to happen and then act. \\n\\nTo know when an avalanche may happen we need to know under what conditions they are likely to occur and which of these conditions are most important. Once these conditions are known, processes can be set up to judge whether or not an avalanche is likely. This is the science of avalanche forecasting, a science in which there are no second chances. An unforeseen avalanche could result in loss of life, disruption and high clean up and repair costs; whereas almost as seriously, a false alarm may result in unnecessary panic and evacuation. The net result of both these occurrences being loss of faith in the forecaster and in the science as a whole. If people do not trust the warnings or assurances of an avalanche forecaster they become ineffective no matter how accurate they are next time. Williams (1980) states that to be effective, an Avalanche warning program must inspire public confidence. It is therefore in everyone’s interest for the processes involved in avalanche forecasting to be a fool–proof and trustworthy as possible.\\n\\nAccording to LaChapelle (1977), avalanche forecasting has been done ever since human beings first began to live on mountains, even by resorting to witchcraft, he suggests. Since the 1950s methods of avalanche forecasting have become more scientific, although depending on empirical experience and intuition. Recent work has concentrated on the use of computers and models with some exceptions, notably Professor Dent of Montana State University who places an observation hut in the path of an artificially induced avalanche. From there he can make close observations of the way the snow travels and the velocities, densities and pressures thus involved; in the hope of learning more about how an avalanche is initiated. He hopes to develop new models and tools to remove the educated guesswork, replacing it with ‘hard science’ (Dent in Holdsworth 1998). The Swiss Snow and Avalanche Institute has recently initiated similar research led by Dr. Issler. Some of their findings were critical in solving the mystery of the catastrophic and unexpected Galtür avalanche in February 1999. Before these scientists braved real avalanches, studies relied upon the simulation of avalanches using powdered glass in water tanks (Thompson 1999, Hopfinger et al 1977).\\n\\n== Field Methods ==\\n\\n== Computer Models ==\\n\\n== References ==\\nArmstrong, R.L. 1977. ‘Continuos Monitoring of Metamorphic Changes of Internal Snow Structure as a Tool in Avalanche Studies.’ Journal of Glaciology, 19, pp 325 – 334.\\nBolognesi, R., Buser, O and Good, W. 1994. ‘Local Avalanche Forecasting in Swizerland: Strategy and Tools.

'''Welcome To The Marble Arch by Montcalm London'''\\n[[File:Example.jpg]]\\n\\nAbout 30 million tourists visit the capital of England i.e. London every year. This is not the only good reason why London has left behind New York and Paris to become the most visited capital city in the world. History buffs, shopping enthusiasts, sightseers and art lovers, all enjoy a satisfactory holiday in this city. \\nLondon caters to all choices and has an eclectic mix of tourist attractions that are among the most popular in the world. The city also takes pride in being home to many UNESCO world heritage sites. The only downside of visiting London and enjoying the various tourist activities available here is the high expenses associated with everything. Due to this, it is important that you stay at one of the budget hotels near London major attractions to save on money.
\\n\\nUnique characteristics of Rational Behavior Therapy as a psychotherapy in general, and as a cognitive-behavioral therapy in particular:\\n\\n* Based on the [[neurophysiology]] of a healthy [[human brain]] (unlike other therapies based on introspection, observation, or the stoic philosophical influences on [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]]). \\n* It is relatively easy to teach and easy to learn (doesn’t require identification of disorders or knowledge of medical terms). \\n* Clients define what is healthy thinking for them. \\n* Clients are coached to become their own therapists (Rational Behavior Self-Counseling).  \\n* In 1971, RBT psychiatrists pioneered visualization practices and the use of imagery to develop healthy thoughts, emotions and behaviors. \\n* Formulated psychosomatic learning theory and recognizes a specific form of cognitive-emotive dissonance as an inevitable stage in the process of voluntary change. It is an instance when as soon as one starts practicing the new behavior that is in conflict with old habits one begins experiencing a feeling as wrong, weird, or unnatural. That is the stage where people frequently, unfortunately, quit practicing.  \\n* It also accepts the potential health value of religious, spiritual, and deeply-rooted philosophical or existential beliefs, and their beneficial application and integration into a cognitive-behavioral, non-denominational, spiritual or existential counseling.
'''OPEN INNOVATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY'''\\n\\n    Open Innovation is a new strategy which many industries, corporate houses and the like are applying in order to commercialize their internal IP (intellectual property) and to obtain a huge plethora of external innovations in order to commercialize them as well. In this approach, firms work and interact with external partners and create newer and better technologies and products and thereby benefitting from this interaction. In other words Open Innovation is also known as Commons based Peer Production. This term was coined by Harvard Law School Professor Yochai Benkler to portray a new model of economic production, in which the resourceful energy of a large number of people is coordinated with the aid of internet into projects without the usual hierarchical organization. Open Innovation actually means connecting external and internal ideas/technologies.\\n\\n    The basic premise of Open Innovation is: Keep your valuable proprietary to yourself and leave everything else to external innovation. Innovation is less about inventing new or building new things and more about coordinating good ideas for commercialization.
Bank robbery is the crime of stealing from a bank. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, robbery is, "the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear."[1] By contrast, burglary is defined as, "unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft."[2] Definitions vary in other countries, however. In the United Kingdom, robbery is the removal or taking away of property from a place in which you are entitled to be (without any requirement for force or violence to be threatened or used)[dubious – discuss], whilst burglary is largely in line with the US version, entering property unlawfully. In layman's terms, therefore, bank robbery is entering a bank when it is open and either by using force or the threat of force or otherwise obtaining valuables, usually money. Entering a bank when it is closed is burglary.\\n\\nBank robbery is a predominantly urban crime, taking place most frequently in cities and large towns. The share of bank robberies in small towns increased from about 20% in 1996 to about one third in 2002[citation needed], but the majority of bank robberies are concentrated in urban areas. This concentration is often attributed to there being more branches in urban areas, but the number of bank robberies is disproportionately higher than the number of branches. In Canada, for example, seven cities have 30 percent of all bank branches but 66 percent of all bank robberies; in the United Kingdom, London has 10 percent of the nation's branches but 39 percent of its bank robberies.\\n\\nThis has advantages both for bank robbers and for the law enforcement community. Being in urban areas the transportation infrastructure is more highly developed, especially where banks tend to cluster near to retail shopping areas and commercial districts. Such banks are highly profitable targets for bank robbers who are then afforded a number of potential escape routes. The law enforcement community benefit by being able to respond more quickly and the likelihood of catching a bank robber on or near the scene is higher than for other types of crime. This is because most bank robberies are reported very quickly, frequently while the crime is in progress, most bank robberies occur during daylight hours, have multiple witnesses and with modern technology often produce photographic images that can be distributed and used immediately to canvass the local area. Consequently, many robbers are caught the same day. In fact, the clearance rate for bank robbery is among the highest of all crimes, almost 60 percent.\\n\\nThe urban location of the crime also contributes to its repeat victimization profile, a measure of how quickly a crime victim will suffer a repeat of the original crime. One study carried out by the Home Office found that in England, one third of banks at which a robbery has occurred will be robbed again within three months, while the same study found that in Tallahassee, Florida, one quarter of robbed banks will suffer repeat robbery within a week, and over half of robbed banks will be robbed again within a month. [3]\\n\\nThe Australian Institute of Criminology analyzed trends in bank robbery over a four year period. Of the 808 bank robbery incidents between January 1998 and May 2002 in which the number of offenders involved in the hold-up was recorded, more than half (55 percent) were committed by lone offenders, about 25 percent by pairs, and around 20 percent by three or more robbers. Unarmed lone offenders accounted for the majority of all robberies (28 percent of all robberies), caused the least number of injuries to victims (one percent of all victims' injuries), were the type of robber who most often used a note to threaten bank staff (46 percent of all their robberies), and failed most often in their robbery attempts (33 percent of their robberies). Unarmed gangs inflicted the most injuries to victims (51 percent of all victim injuries) and failed the least in their robbery attempts (six percent of their robberies). Armed robbers used a disguise more often compared to unarmed robbers, with armed pairs employing disguises most often (59 percent of their robberies).[4]\\n\\nA 2005 study by Pastore and Maguire found that injuries occur in about two percent of bank robberies in the US, and about six percent of robberies in Australia, and that a death occurs in approximately one third of all bank robberies.[5]\\n\\nViolent takeover type bank robberies do occur, but are very rare. The majority of bank robberies taking place today are so called "note jobs." These are usually accomplished by simply passing a written note to the teller demanding money. The idea is to attract as little attention as possible. In most cases, other customers present in the bank during such a robbery are completely unaware of what is occurring. Standard bank policy is to avoid violence as much as possible, so they will normally hand over the money and try to adhere to the robber's demands. The robber usually makes away with cash, but typically in relatively small amounts.\\nContents\\n[hide]\\n\\n    * 1 History\\n          o 1.1 Historical Bank Robbers\\n    * 2 Prevention\\n    * 3 See also\\n    * 4 References\\n    * 5 External links\\n\\n[edit] History\\nBurglars Tools Found in the Bank, printed in 1875 in the Canadian Illustrated News\\n\\nAccording to the Independence Hall Association in Philadelphia, the first bank robbery in America happened during the night of August 31 or the early morning of September 1, 1798 at the Bank of Pennsylvania at Carpenters' Hall. The vaults were apparently robbed of $162,821, or approximately $1.8 million in 2006 dollars. Because no forced entry evidence existed, authorities assumed it was an "inside" job. Several suspects were immediately imprisoned and prosecuted, but the culprits eventually charged were a man, Isaac Davis, and a partner. Within days of the heist, Davis' partner fell victim to a plague of yellow fever that ravaged Philadelphia that summer.\\n\\nDuring the American Civil War, raiders from both Union and Confederate armies robbed banks in enemy-controlled towns. These robberies were at the time regarded as legitimate acts of war, but many of the raiders carried on robbing banks in the post-war era, giving rise to the famous robber gangs of the late 19th century.\\n\\n[edit] Historical Bank Robbers\\n\\nIn the early twentieth century Willie Sutton was asked why he robbed banks and he was famously reported as answering "Because that's where the money is." This is, in fact, a quote invented by the interviewer to make the story more interesting.[6] Another famous bank robber was John Dillinger, who committed bank robbery crimes in mid-western America. Some considered him a dangerous criminal, while others idolized him as a supposed present-day Robin Hood. He gained this latter reputation (and the nickname "Jackrabbit") for his graceful movements during bank heists, such as leaping over the counter (a movement he supposedly copied from the movies) and many narrow getaways from police. On July 22, 1934 in Chicago, Illinois, Dillinger was cornered by FBI agents in an alley outside of a movie theater, drew a pistol against them, and died at that location of gunshot wounds.\\n\\n[edit] Prevention\\n\\nBanks have implemented modern security measures, like motion-sensing and high resolution color security cameras, time-locked heavy vault doors, silent alarms, exploding dye packs, bait money and locator devices. Some banks supplement this protection with armed or unarmed security guards. [7]\\n\\nGone are the days when expert safe crackers could crack the code to a vault or safe. Today's biometric technology makes non-violent methods of gaining access nearly impossible. Modern vaults and safes are also reinforced to the point that the amount of explosives needed to blow them open would likely create unwanted attention and possible even cause the building to collapse. Even the most impregnable vault or safe needs to be able to be opened by someone. To circumvent vault and safe security features, robbers often kidnap the bank manager, but that is not always a successful workaround as banks have often removed the manager's ability to open the vault. Kidnapping also enables the police to lay more charges and thus more jail time for the robbers should they get caught.\\n\\nThe police have new measures at their disposal to catch robbers, such as well-armed SWAT teams, and pursuit cars (often a high-powered vehicle) driven by a trained driver that is capable of keeping pace with getaway cars. Forensic identification techniques have also improved greatly; should a bank robber fire a gun, the police can trace the bullet to the exact firearm using ballistic fingerprinting. Martin Kemp, in a BBC documentary, once inquired on the effectiveness of an Uzi in a bank robbery, to which the firearms training instructor joked "that would be thirty pieces of evidence to convict you." The sawed-off shotgun, a common robbery weapon in United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand where handguns are difficult to obtain, are easily concealable but not particularly effective.\\n\\nWhile it is likely but not certain that the first time someone robs a bank they will not be caught, it is highly likely that if they continue they will be caught. Few criminals are able to make a successful living out of bank robbery over the long run, since each attempt increases the probability that they will be identified and caught. Bank robberies are still fairly common and are indeed successful, although eventually many bank robbers are found and arrested. A report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation[8] states that, among Category I serious crimes, the arrest rate for bank robbery in 2001 was second only to that of murder. Today most organized crime groups tend to make their money by other means, such as drug trafficking, gambling, loan sharking, identity theft, or online scamming and phishing.\\n\\nA further factor making bank robbery unattractive for criminals in the United States is the severity with which it is prosecuted. Accounts at all US banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a corporation of the federal government, bringing bank robbery under federal jurisdiction and involving the FBI. United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines for bank robbery mandate long prison terms, which are usually further enhanced by the use or carrying of loaded firearms, prior criminal convictions, and the absence of parole from the federal prison system. As with any type of robbery, the fact that bank robbery is also inherently a violent crime typically causes corrections administrators to place imprisoned bank robbers in harsher high-security institutions.\\n\\n[edit] See also\\n\\n    * List of famous bank robbers and robberies\\n    * Convenience store crime\\n\\n[edit] References\\n\\n   1. ^ FBI definition of Bank Robbery\\n   2. ^ FBI definition of Burglary\\n   3. ^ Home Office study\\n   4. ^ Australian Institute of Criminology\\n   5. ^ Pastore and Maguire\\n   6. ^ Willie Sutton\\n   7. ^ Design of a GPS/GSM currency tracker device\\n   8. ^ Bank Robbery in the United States\\n\\n[edit] External links\\n\\n    * Armed Robbery Training Manuals and Training for sale\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2003\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2004\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2005\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2006\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2007 Q1\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2007 Q2\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2007 Q3\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2007 Q4\\n\\nRetrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_robbery"\\nCategories: Bank robberies | Bank robbers\\nHidden categories: Cleanup from July 2007 | All pages needing cleanup | Articles with limited geographic scope | Articles with disputed statements from June 2009 | All articles with unsourced statements | Articles with unsourced statements from April 2009\\nViews\\n\\n    * Article\\n    * Discussion\\n    * Edit this page\\n    * History\\n    * Watch\\n\\nPersonal tools\\n\\n    * Try Beta\\n    * VERY2PACKING00\\n    * My talk\\n    * My preferences\\n    * My watchlist\\n    * My contributions\\n    * Log out\\n\\nNavigation\\n\\n    * Main page\\n    * Contents\\n    * Featured content\\n    * Current events\\n    * Random article\\n\\nSearch\\n \\nInteraction\\n\\n    * About Wikipedia\\n    * Community portal\\n    * Recent changes\\n    * Contact Wikipedia\\n    * Donate to Wikipedia\\n    * Help\\n\\nToolbox\\n\\n    * What links here\\n    * Related changes\\n    * Upload file\\n    * Special pages\\n    * Printable version\\n    * Permanent link\\n    * Cite this page\\n    * PDF version\\n\\nCreate a book\\n\\n    * Add page to book\\n    * Books help\\n\\nLanguages\\n\\n    * Cymraeg\\n    * Deutsch\\n    * Español\\n    * Nederlands\\n    * 日本語\\n    * Svenska\\n    * ไทย\\n\\nPowered by MediaWiki\\nWikimedia Foundation\\n\\n    * This page was last modified on 12 August 2009 at 05:54.\\n    * Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License; additional terms may apply.

VIRUS IDENTIFICATION: A CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIVIRAL THERAPY\\nBiswendu B. Goswami, Ph.D.\\nUnited States Food and Drug Administration (Retired)\\nCurrent Address: 7624 Epsilon Drive, Derwood, MD 20855\\nTel:301-990-6940; \\nAbstract:\\nThe necessity for rapid methods of virus identification arose from the fact that human diseases caused by food-borne viruses range from infectious hepatitis to acute gastroenteritis. The viral causative agents run the gamut from simple single stranded RNA viruses (hepatitis A or infectious hepatitis), to more complex double stranded RNA viruses such as rotavirus and large single stranded RNA viruses such as corona virus. To complicate matters further, each of these virus species have dozens of genotypes ( each genome differing from the prototype by a few to hundreds of nucleotides, depending on the size of the genome. The number of human infections reported each year has made these viruses a major public health problem in the USA in recent years. Food-borne viruses have been associated with high morbidity and some mortality. Currently, other than disinfection guidelines, there are no effective control measures available for public health agencies to intervene in a meaningful way to reduce the incidence of food-borne infections. Viruses can be detected in both stool and vomitus, and the usual route of spread is via person to person. With the availability of more sensitive molecular diagnostics, increasingly outbreaks are reported where the initial source of the infection is contaminated food or water. For FDA (Food and Drug Administration), CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and ORA (Office of Regulatory Affairs), detection of the virus in clinical samples and contaminated food or water is essential to develop meaningful policies for control and prevention.\\nKeywords: Virus Identification; Microarray; Sequence independent target synthesis\\n2\\nIntroduction:\\nProcedures for virus identification is going through a revolution due to two recent developments. The orthodox methods for virus identification by cell culture followed by secondary confirmation by immunological or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques were too slow and labor intensive. PCR based methods have the added disadvantages they are extremely sensitive to impurities in the test material, and have very narrow specificity, requiring individual tests for each virus, and confirmation by sequencing is frequently a necessity to distinguish viral genotypes and sub-genotypes in a species..\\nMicroarray hybridization based techniques for the identification of known mutations in specific areas of viral genomes initially were successfully performed by synthesizing oligodeoxy nucleotide probes based on the sequence of wild-type and mutated viral genomes. The probes (individually synthesized) were then immobilized on solid supports by hand spotting, and later by automated programmable applicators that could handle several hundred probes [1] - [9]. An alternative to the traditional dye termination method of sequencing nucleic acids based on hybridization to oligonucleotide probes on solid support was developed in the 1990s [10]- [13].. However, the true potential for identification of viruses on a massive scale based on sequence of viral genomes did not take off until the development of in situ probe synthesis and immobilization techniques by [11] [14] ;[15]. These newer photolithographic techniques allowed for the synthesis and simultaneous immobilization of hundreds of thousands of probes in a single microarray allowing re-sequencing on a large scale by hybridization to identify virus genotypes. Wong et al., [16]Genome Res. 2007 or 2004?) used such an\\n3\\narray incorporating more than 383,000 probes to sequence the entire 29.7 kb genome of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (coronavirus). Since then, microarrays have been developed that can incorporate over two million probes , This development opened up the possibility of identifying multiple virus species and genotypes in a single experiment. However, to realize this potential, it is necessary to have a target synthesis method that is independent of the sequence of the viruses present in the test material.\\nThe new microarray based method developed in my laboratory at Food and Drug Administration (FDA), avoids PCR amplification with virus specific primers normally used for target synthesis in microarray experiments. However, it must be realized that PCR increases the number of specic targets by millions of folds, that makes very sensitive virus detection possible, As can be imagined, such sensitive detection is not possible without a means of target or signal amplification. This disadvantage in sensitivity is somewhat mitigated by the ability to amplify the signal produced by hybridization using biotin labeling of targets follwed by immunological detection of the biotin by Cy3 labeled streptavidin due to its strong affinity to biotin. A further signal amplification is possible by a second round of reaction with streptavidin foloowed by reaction with Cy3 labeled strptavidin. [17 ]. Detection and identification of any viral sequence is thus possible within this limitations, as,long as it’s sequence is represented in the array [17; 18;19]. Sensitivity may be further improved using modifications such as anti-sense RNA (aRNA) amplification.\\nConsidering the number of viral diseases extant in the world today, only a few of them are controllable by prophylactic use of vaccines. The ease with which viruses\\n4\\ndevelop resistance to vaccines is another major concern. Emergence of resistance viruses is difficult to detect by orthodox methods of cell culture, or even by conventional PCR. As an example , we can cite the experience in many third world countries , which at one time were considered free of poliovirus, but are now experiencing reemergence of this scourge, mainly due to the use of attenuated virus strains for vaccination, which then circulate within the population mainly through fecal contamination [5; 6]. This recirculation allows the virus to undergo multiple rounds of replication raising the possibility of mutations in the genome. A single or a handful of mutations in the genome gives rise to a resistance strain. It is not difficult to imagine a situation when other viruses now effectively controlled by vaccination will develop resistance to existing vaccines. The flu virus is a prime example. New Flu vaccines are needed to be developed almost every year due to development of resistance due to genome mutation [].\\nAn even more dangerous and potentially disastrous trend is developing in the United States where a false correlation between Thermosal , a mercury based preservative used in vaccines and Autism has been widely publicized. As a result, many parents now believe that it is preferable not to vaccinate the children to prevent development of Autism, and leave them exposed to risks of diseases such as polio and mumps. The faulty initial report has since been rescinded, but a potentially very dangerous movement has taken root.\\nFood-borne viruses have been recognized as a major challenge to public health for a number of years. Historically, paralytic poliomyelitis transmitted mainly by unpasteurized milk was an eye opener to public health agencies including FDA to the connection between unsafe foods and human health. The introduction of pasteurization\\n5\\nand subsequently the development of polio vaccines, and a national program for polio vaccination have made polio a thing of the past. Recently however, other food-borne viral illnesses have emerged to threaten the health and safety of a public that have become increasingly complacent due to the increased bacterial surveillance and implementation of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) throughout United States and Europe. Fortunately, it is much easier to detect bacteria in foods. Bacteria grow in simple media, which can then be identified by multiple methods [17, 20]. Despite this, frequent localized epidemics of E.coli and Salmonella from contaminated foods such as meat and vegetables are frequently reported. Virus detection in foods is much more difficult, because unlike bacteria they are obligatory intracellular parasites, and can only be grown with difficulty in cultured animal cell lines [1,2,3,5,7,9,16]. The time factor is of critical importance, and detection can only be achieved by extremely sensitive molecular methods such as PCR. More recently, attempts are being made to use the microarray techniques for virus detection [7; 9 21; 22; 23; 24; 25; 26; 27; 28]. Unfortunately, both types of methods are prone to false negative results, particularly when applied to food matrices. Laboratories are reluctant to invest in equipment and trained personnel because the success rate is so low. The success rate of virus detection is fairly high in body fluids and feces, because these sources have relatively high levels of virus contamination [5; 6; 16; 21; 22; 29; 30; 31. The success rate at FDA and other laboratories in virus detection in foods is very low as noted above, because we had to deal with foods, where contamination levels are naturally low. Moreover, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have the added advantage of hindsight [32]. They test specimens only from patients with overt signs of disease. But once a disease outbreak has occurred in a\\n6\\npopulation, control measures by the CDC are totally inadequate. Vaccines available are effective only prophylactically to prevent further spread of the disease among the non-infected population. Not knowing what food caused the disease outbreak, FDA is unable to advise the population to avoid certain types of food except in very general terms. Recommendations concerning the cleaning of food prior to cooking and consumption, also is hardly effective..\\nMost food-borne viruses have RNA genomes, with minimal viral functions necessary for virus propagation. As a result, development of chemical therapeutic agents has been very slow, with only a handful of agents such as Ribavirin [33] and a few other nucleoside analogs such as Xyloadenosine (XyloA) showing potential to be effective against certain viruses [34; 35; 36]. Interferon induced 2’-5’ linked oligoadenosine (2-5A) and its analogs have not been adequately tested [37; 38; 39]. Additionaly, food-borne RNA viruses are notoriously resistant to inactivation by physical or chemical agents [40; 41 ]. Chief among them in developed countries is norovirus (NV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV).. It is now a recognized fact that NV is the causal agent of most food-borne viral infections in the U.S., while other viruses such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), enteroviruses A and B (HEA and HEB) and rotavirus are also contributors. These illnesses can occur following consumption of contaminated food, person-to-person contact, or food contaminated by infected food handlers, or by contact with water contaminated by treated or untreated sewage [42].\\nA number of factors have compromised FDA’s ability to respond to this new threat by instituting adequate regulatory framework. Projects implemented by FDA have been top-heavy with much more emphasis on sophisticated methods of virus detection, while\\n7\\nthe problem resides in the isolation of low levels of virus from large quantities of suspected foods in a sufficiently pure form to be effectively detected by these ultrasensitive techniques [. We will address this gap in our ability to provide an underpinning of laboratory science by investigating new detection technologies that will allow FDA and other regulatory agencies such as CDC to respond to food-borne virus infections by identifying the viral agent, determining the source, and the relatedness and extent of such outbreaks, when discussing specific results [24;27]\\nMaterials and Methods\\nThe paradigm of virus detection technologies currently available is inadequate in several respects. The technology is mainly based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based amplification of viral nucleic acids. Since most food-borne viruses have an RNA genome, a process called reverse transcription (RT) to first transcribe viral RNA to cDNA is appended to the PCR procedure (called RT-PCR). This technology is two decades old [43] , although the application of this technology for virus detection in foods is more recent [24;27; 28;29;30; 31]. Several important modifications to the basic RT-PCR have been instituted, such as multiplex PCR [30], competitive PCR [32], real time PCR [23] ,which have increased the sensitivity of virus detection and reduced the time needed to obtain results. The major disadvantage of (real-time) RT-PCR for detection of an unknown virus is the specificity of most of these assays. For example, during an outbreak investigation samples will be screened for an etiologic agent that best matches the clinical symptoms when evaluable (norovirus and rotavirus for acute gastroenteritis and HAV for hepatitis) which may delay reporting if an unexpected etiologic agent is causing the outbreak [33]..\\n8\\nTo develop new high density oligonucleotide microarray methods with broad specificity for the sensitive detection and typing of foodborne viruses, these methods will have to be able to i) detect which virus is present, ii) the genogroup and genotype and if needed sub-genotype of the virus. This information could then be used to alert the regulatory agencies on the emergence of new virus strains which is currently not possible without sequencing multiple PCR products. Such detection processes will not be dependent on PCR amplification. Therefore, no prior knowledge of the nature of the virus or its genome sequence will be necessary. The same analyte will be used in a single experiment to obtain all the information needed to identify multiple viruses in the same sample. The high density oligonucleotide microarray based procedure has been used in combination with PCR amplification to study the evolution of the SARS coronavirus ([ 16], and bacterial genomes [20;17] as well as for the detection of mutations in the poliovirus genome ([6] . We have identified different types of HAV and HEA and HEB (more commonly known as coxsackieviruses A and B) viruses as well as studied the evolution of the wild type HAV genome HM175 to a cytopathic variant HM175/18f using a high density (> than 13,000 probes) microarray to detect the nucleotide changes accompanying this phenotypic change [18].\\nAdvances in microarray technology have allowed the identification of genetic variability over very long stretches of DNA in bacterial genomes [17; 20]. These newly developed high density microarrays contain thousands to hundreds of thousands of oligonucleotide probes, instead of a few dozen as used for detection of mutations in poliovirus genome during evolution from a vaccine strain to paralytic poliomyelitis strain [ 6 ; 5] in a single array thereby expanding the power of identification.\\n9\\nIsolation and labeling of Viral RNA. Viral RNA from HAV and CXKV strains were purified from 140 μl of virus cell culture supernatant with a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For norovirus samples, a 10% (wt/vol) stool suspension was prepared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 20 minutes. RNA was extracted from 140 μl to 280 μl of the supernatant with QIAamp viral RNA mini kit. The RNA samples were eluted in 50 μl of elution buffer and stored at -80 ºC until used. Reverse transcription was performed for one cycle (42 °C, 60 min) using random hexamer primers (Invitrogen, CA) followed by 15 min at 70 °C. This is essentially the initial step in current RT-PCR protocols. Reverse transcriptase requires a primer DNA or RNA) with a free 3’OH group hybridized to a template (DNA or RNA) to initiate cDNA synthesis. Viral RNAs that do not have a poly (A) sequence at their 3’end (such as rotavirus genomic RNA) cannot be primed by oligo (dT)15 and are primed by random hexamers. Resulting cDNA was fragmented with DNase I (Invitrogen, CA) at 37 °C for 1 min. Fragmented cDNA was labeled with Terminal Transferase (Invitrogen, CA) in the presence of biotin-11-ddATP (PerkinElmer, MA) at 37 °C for 4 hrs so that the fragmentwd cDNA is extended by a single nucleotide, which does not change its hybridization characteristis to the probes in the array..\\nThe biotin labeled synthesized targets are then hybridized to the probes on the microarray. Following a series of washes, the hybridized targets are reacted with Cy3 labeled streptavidin. After further washes to remove unreacted Cy3 coupled strptavidin, hybridized targets are detected by Cy3 fluorescence by scanning the array.\\n10\\nA typical result is shown in Fig.1... Computer analysis of the signal by software developed for this purpose is used to identify the virus species, genogroup and the strain within the genogroup.\\nMicroarray Hybridization, Scanning, and Data Analysis. Microarray hybridization was performed using the Affymetrix protocol. Briefly, Biotinylated cDNA in the presence of Affymetrix hybridization buffer was hybridized to the microarray chip in a total volume of 120 μl. Before application to the array, the samples were heated to 98 °C for 1 min, cooled at 45 °C for another 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 5 min. The microarray chip was then incubated at 45 °C for 16 hrs in a hybridization oven. Following hybridization, the wash and stain procedures were carried out by the Fluidics station (Affymetrix, CA). All arrays were imaged by using Affymetrix microarray scanner at a resolution of 10 μm per pixel. Signal intensity of the hybridization was extracted by using Affymetrix power tools, and the subsequent data analysis was performed using MS Excel. For each viral genome represented on the array, the average signal intensity for all the probes within that genome was determined. The average intensity is first determined as described by Jackson et al. (16), and Ayodeji et al. (17). Each average genome intensity was then normalized by the average intensity of all the probes represented on the array. To minimize effects of nonspecific hybridization, an empirical cutoff value of 3 was considered as a threshold value for a positive signal. Microarray hybridization data were then converted to color visualization schemes in which hybridization signal intensity is reflected by the color scale of vertical strips.\\nMicroarray design:\\n11\\nAll microarrays used in this study were customer ordered to be fabricated by Affymetrix Inc. (Santa Clara, CA) using a maskless array synthesis technology (Singh-Gasson et al., 1999; Nuwaysir et al., 2002. The tiling microarray contained 25-mer oligonucleotide probes which were designed to detect common food-borne viruses including hepatitis A virus, norovirus, coxsackievirus, rotavirus, hepatitis E virus, and astrovirus as well as saporovirus. All viral genetic sequence data were obtained from database of viral genomes from Genbank. The chips were composed of overlapping 25-mer oligonucleotides which covered 3,000 bp sequences from 5’ end viral genomes of each virus. Each sequence of interest was tiled with the 25-mer probes with 2-bp spacing. The microarray representation of common foodborne viruses are listed in Tables. 1 to 6 along with specific hybridization signal intensities that reflect relatedness of virus strains within the same species..\\nThe design of the microarray follows closely the protocol we have recently described ([39]Ayodeji et al. 2009; Chen at al. [41}). However, instead of 13,000 probes, these arrays each contain 100,000 probes covering every complete and partial sequences available in the database for NoV, HAV, HEA, HEB and RV. We also developed probes covering the entire sequence of several individual viral genome sequences. . Probes are designed to have a 2 base overlap i.e., each probe starts at the 2nd nucleotide of every sequence, thereby covering a 7.5kb genome with about 1500 probes. 7.5 kb is the average size of the RNA genome of a common food-borne virus except rotavirus that has a segmented double stranded RNA genome, where each segment RNA is 1.5 to 2kbp long. Alternatively, the 5 base overlap between consecutive probes may be reduced to increase the number of probes to cover the same sequence Since the capacity of the\\n12\\nmicroarrays (up to 2 million probes) far exceeds the number of probes in our current array design (100,000), we could incorporate probes covering more viruses, although not all virus groups were tested for this study. However, these served the purpose of negative controls to show that false positives were not seen. For target synthesis for these experiments, we have investigated whether viral targets can be obtained in sufficient quantities in a sequence non-specific manner to hybridize to a high density microarray containing greater than 100,000 probes representing all the known sequences (partial or complete) of the major foodborne viruses (NV, HAV, HEA, HEB and rotaviruses) and identify the viral strain (or strains) present in a sample.\\nRESULTS\\nTables1to 6 show the lists the selected enteric viruses and the number of probes for each strain of virus that were synthesized directly on the FDA_EVIR microarray by photolithography whereby the total number of probes on the array is 91542. Selected regions of several enteric viruses’ genomes were tiled at two nucleotide spacing. Each probe is 25 nucleotides long and there is a 23 base-pair overlap between consecutive probes for the same virus genotype; therefore, the complete array covers 183,084 nucleotides of viral genomic sequence. The probe numbers we used for each strain of HAV for the sequence coverage of several HAV strains belonging to HAV genogroups I to III are shown in Table 1.. But no attempt was made to include all the partial sequences that exist in the database., although we included some of the VP1-2 and VP3 regions, that are reported to contain maximum sequence conservation.\\n13\\nTable 1.

They included HM-175/18f, HAS-15, and PA21, which represented genotype IB, IA, and IIIA, respectively.

Although various degree of cross-hybridization to genotype IA oligoprobes was also observed, the strongest signal was identified in genotype IB oligoprobes. Genotype IB oligoprobes yielded at least seven times above the local background, ranging from 29 to 7.7 times.

Although cross-hybridization within different genotype strains in HAV genus occurred, this was expected due to less divergence among genotypes of HAV. Stronger hybridization signal was obtained between specific genotype viral RNA and array elements derived from the same genotypic virus. Based on the hybridization pattern and the sequence information of the probes, it is clearly possible to detect and type HAV.\\nOur results indicate that the microarray hybridization technique can be applied to the identification of different viruses present in a sample and detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) to identify closely related viral strains belonging to the same species [35](Ayodeji et al. 2009). However, the current protocols for SARS virus ([16]Wong et al., 2004), poliovirus ([5]Cherkasova et al., 2003; [6]Laassri et al., 2005),\\n17\\nand rotavirus ([38]Honma et al., 2007; [3]Chizhikov, et al., 2002), still depend on RT-PCR for target synthesis to be used in hybridization experiments. Using virus-specific RT-PCR assays requires prior knowledge of the virus to be expected in the sample hence potentially missing other viral disease agents that may be present in the sample but go undetected. Since current microarray allow of the use of up to 2 million probes in a single array, the potential for the detection and identification of many viral disease agents in a single experiment is not fully realized.\\nIn our laboratory, we have investigated whether viral targets can be obtained in sufficient quantities in a sequence non-specific manner to hybridize to a high density microarray containing greater than 100,000 probes representing all the known sequences (partial or complete) of the major foodborne viruses (NV, HAV, HEA, HEB and rotaviruses) and identify the viral strain (or strains) present in a sample. Synthesis of cDNA in a non-sequence specific manner was accomplished by reverse transcription of viral RNA using a mixture of random hexamers or olig(dT)15 to prime cDNA synthesis using viral RNA as template by AMV reverse transcriptase. This is essentially the initial step in current RT-PCR protocols. Reverse transcriptase requires a primer DNA or RNA) with a free 3’OH group hybridized to a template (DNA or RNA) to initiate cDNA synthesis. Viral RNAs that do not have a poly (A) sequence at their 3’end (such as rotavirus genomic RNA) cannot be primed by oligo (dT)15 and are primed by random hexamers. We then label the cDNA (see below for details). The synthesized targets are then hybridized to the probes on the microarray and the array scanned for hybridization signal (see Fig.1). Computer analysis of the signal by software developed for this\\n18\\npurpose is used to identify the virus species, genogroup and the strain within the genogroup.\\nSimaltaneous Detection of Mulitple HAV Genotypes\\nDetection of Noroviruses.\\nTo access the applicability of the tiling microarray for norovirus identification in a clinical setting, we examined three stool specimens isolated from infected patients.

A mixture of cDNA derived from the three viruses was hybridized to the microarray chip. As shown in Fig. 5, CXKV B3 displayed a clear-cut hybridization pattern distinguishable from other coxsackieviruses, making it possible to determine the virus serotype; Strong hybridization to the genotype IB oligoprobes was observed in HAV HM-175/18f although cross-hybridization to genotype IA oligoprobes also occurred (Table.6). In all positive hybridization, the average signal intensity ratio of IB-specific oligoprobes was 8.3 while IA was 4.2, which indicated that the array elements are capable of detecting and typing HAV. Good hybridization was observed between #3263 and genogroup I oligoprobes derived from noro1 L07418 sequence with signal intensity ratio of 3.9 (Table.6). Fig 5.

The insert shows close-up view of positively hybridized sequences derived from each virus.\\n23\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe long term objective is to use this technique to identify any viral agent present in the sample without investigator bias. Thus the proposed technological change will reveal a true picture of the viral disease agent and not just the confirmation of a notion based on vague symptoms of a disease. This is particularly important because many of the enteroviruses often show similar disease symptoms. It will also enable us to determine whether multiple strains or virus species are involved in a disease outbreak. Although we deem it unnecessary, the outcome of a microarray detection experiment can be independently verified using the more conventional PCR based amplification and sequencing or a second round of hybridization to a more narrowly focused less complex microarray with fewer probe features. We believe that the strength of the microarray technique is in the redundancy of probes used to interrogate a particular sequence making the technique essentially error-free. Variations in the probe sequences in the form of mutated probe oligonucleotides can be included in the array design to further increase the fidelity of virus identification and confidence in the result.\\nNoroviruses (NoV) and to a lesser extent HAV and human rotavirus (RV) are the most common foodborne viruses. Othe picornaviruses such as human enteric viruses A and B have at least the potential to be transmitted via person to person contact, through infected food handlers and contaminated foods. Current epidemiological studies indicate that NoV is responsible for the vast majority of food borne outbreaks in developed countries. The time frame of gastrointestinal disease caused by NoV is very unique due to the rapid onset of symptoms and easier to spot and a correlation to specific food consumption easier to establish that other viruses such as HEA or HEB or RV. The\\n24\\nsecond most common foodborne virus HAV has a rather long incubation period before disease symptoms become apparent. Epidemiological correlation to any specific food consumption thus is rather difficult to establish.\\nThe detection of food-borne viruses in clinical samples (mainly stool samples from outbreak investigations) is extremely difficult using cell culture due to the inability to grow NV and HAV in cultured cells. Hence molecular methods such as real-time RT-PCR are currently used for the detection of foodborne viruses in clinical samples. The current hypothesis developed from this need to broaden the scope of detection without sacrificing the sensitivity and rapidity of detection and the need to obtain more information from an experiment that is currently possible with RT-PCR.\\nThe strategy behind this proposal is to investigate whether food-borne virus detection and identification based on high density microarray hybridization currently being developed at Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) can be utilized for routine virus detection in FDA and other agencies such as CDC and Office of Regulatory Research (ORA) for the rapid detection and unambiguous identification (genotyping) of these viral disease agents from diverse source materials. Due to time limitation, we will concentrate our efforts on the detection of virus from stool samples from outbreak investigations available from CDC. Currently, outbreak investigations are geared to detecting and broad genogroup identification of the most common food borne virus NV. Due to the relative low frequency of other foodborne viral diseases, these viruses are usually not targeted. However, RNA virus populations are highly heterogeneous even within a particular genogroup, and genogroup identification using PCR primers based on consensus sequences are unable to identify the particular strain within the genogroup.\\n25\\nAnalysis of outbreak strain identification is therefore incomplete, since a particular strain within a genogroup may be responsible for the outbreak being studied. In addition, the narrow focus on a particular species of virus ignores other viruses that are also food-borne and may be present in a particular outbreak, which could have provided valuable information as to the source o[[File:Example.jpg]]f the outbreak.\\nConclusion:\\nWe hypothesize that advanced microarray design that incorporates probes for multiple virus species and strains will be able to provide the needed information to pinpoint the exact strain of the virus responsible for the outbreak, and also provide information as to the presence of other viruses that may be associated with that outbreak.\\nStatistical significance of array hybridization signals is computed using array package software where data points are calculated as signal intensity above normalized background (corrected to internal standards) and converted to average probe intensity (Jackson et al. 2007; Wong et al. 2004). Viral samples in the form of stool samples from outbreak investigations will be provided by CDC (NoV) and CBER (RV). The samples will have been typed by specific RT-PCR based methods prior to coding and then supplied to us for microarray experiments. Any initial negative hybridization will trigger a re-sampling and analysis due to the possibility of sampling error or a negative (no virus) sample. Sampling error rates and percent positive identification (following code breakage) will be used to determine statistical success rate of the microarray analysis. We realize that a sample with very low viral load may produce poor hybridization signal. In that case, the viral RNA will be amplified in a sequence non-specific manner using T7 RNA polymerase to preserve the original distribution.\\n26\\nThe success of our microarray screening protocol depends on target synthesis that is not specific to any particular virus. In our preliminary experiments we have achieved target synthesis for our microarray hybridization experiments by eliminating the PCR step by relying on a highly efficient synthesis and labeling of target. Viral RNA was purified from the all virus containing stool samples with a QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer primers. The resultant cDNA is fragmented by DNase 1 digestion and the mixture of the fragments is labeled with biotin-11-ddATP (PerkinElmer, MA) in the presence of Terminal Transferase (Invitrogen, CA). The use of ddATP assures that only a single nucleotide is added to the 3’end of each cDNA fragments and therefore the hybridization characteristics to the oligo-probes on the array is not altered. For signal amplification at the end of hybridization, the biotin in the target now hybridized to the probe is reacted with cy3 labeled streptavidin. The cy3 is detected by scanning and the scans analyzed for the detection of hybridization to specific probes on the array. An example of a typical result is shown in Fig.1. The applicability of this protocol in detecting a single species of virus is shown in Fig.2. The experiment detected genogroup I of NV, with the two peaks of average intensities identifying two different strains. Significantly, the microarray detected two different strains of group I NV in the same sample. The smaller peak has a 91% sequence identity to the main peak supporting our hypothesis (see above) that outbreak samples may contain multiple NV strains that can only be detected using microarray.\\nThe second hypothesis that we propose to test is that microarray hybridization can detect multiple viruses in the same experiment if the target is synthesized and labeled\\n27\\nusing technology that are not dependent on sequence specific PCR amplification. An example is shown in Fig.5 from a recent experiment carried out in our laboratory. RNA samples from three different viruses HAV (genotype HM175), NoV (Group I) and HEB (strain CVB 3) were separately reverse transcribed and labeled as described above. The labeled cDNAs were mixed in equimolar quantities and hybridized. Analysis of hybridization data show that all three viruses were identified. In addition to the HAV and CV strains, the array experiment again identified two closely related strains of NoV as seen in Fig.2, that could not be distinguished by RT-PCR.\\nExpected Outcomes:\\nExperiments performed in different laboratories that have used microarray technology for virus detection and identification have concluded that the potential benefits of the use of microarrays in diagnostic settings is very high. The ability of the microarray for virus identification is attested by the proliferation of virus species that are being examined using this technology (Wong et al., 2004 for SARS coronavirus, Laasari et al. 2005, for Poliovirus, Honma et al. 2007, Chizikov et al. 2002, for rotavirus, Ryabinin et al. 2006, for orthopox virus, Deregt et al. 2006, for swine fever virus, Ayodeji et al. 2009, for hepatitis A and human enteric viruses A and B. The dependence on RT-PCR for target synthesis however has restricted the realization of the full potential of the microarray for multiple virus identification in a single experiment. We have shown by eliminating the PCR step during target synthesis that NoV, HAV and human enterovirus can be identified in the same analyte (Fig.3). Comparison of hybridization intensities from targets synthesized from two different strains of the same virus species can identify nucleotide changes in the virus genome occurring over time (Wong et al. 2004; Ayodeji et.al.\\n28\\n2009). As shown in Fig.3, perhaps the greatest advantage of this technique is to identify a virus strain in the absence of any prior knowledge of the sequence of the virus in the sample by eliminating the need for PCR. Eliminating the need for PCR does not reduce the sensitivity to the level that the virus can no longer be detected (Fig.3). Conceivably it is possible that such a situation will be encountered in samples with very low viral load. In such cases a sequence non-specific RNA amplification procedure may be used to increase the sensitivity. We have to yet test this hypothesis. The other advantage accruing to the agency will be the ability to identify emerging virus strains which are not detectable due to change of sequence at the PCR primer binding site on the genome, and the need for sequencing every PCR product.\\nCurrently, a vaccine against HAV, the second most prevalent foodborne disease is available for prophylactic use. However, a vaccine against NoV is not available to prevent NoV outbreaks. Even where a vaccine for a particular virus is available, vaccination programs to prevent viral disease outbreaks have to be initiated well in advance of a disease outbreak in order to allow time for the targeted population to develop immunity. Another drawback is that viruses frequently mutate to escape immunity as well as to become resistant to antivirals. The microarray data can be of value to provide indication to health officials if resistance strains are emerging and provide sufficient time to change the strategy for controlling an outbreak.\\nEND END\\n29\\nAcknowledgement:\\nThe author wishes to acknowledge the full financial support of the Food and Drug Administration for the work carried out while he was an employee of the Federal Government of the United States of America.\\nReferences:\\n[1] Verhoef LPB, Kroneman A, van Duynhoven Y, Boshuizen H, van Pelt W, Koopmans M.

Briefly, Biotinylated cDNA in the presence of Affymetrix hybridization buffer was hybridized to the microarray chip in a total volume of 120 μl. Before application to the array, the samples were heated to 98 °C for 1 min, cooled at 45 °C for another 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 5 min. The microarray chip was then incubated at 45 °C for 16 hrs in a hybridization oven. Following hybridization, the wash and stain procedures were carried out by the Fluidics station (Affymetrix, CA). All arrays were imaged by using Affymetrix microarray scanner at a resolution of 10 μm per pixel. Signal intensity of the hybridization was extracted by using Affymetrix power tools, and the subsequent data analysis was performed using MS Excel. For each viral genome represented on the array, the average signal intensity for all the probes within that genome was determined. The average intensity is first determined as described by Jackson et al. (16), and Ayodeji et al. (17). Each average genome intensity was then normalized by the average intensity of all the probes represented on the array. To minimize effects of nonspecific hybridization, an empirical cutoff value of 3 was considered as a threshold value for a positive signal. Microarray hybridization data were then converted to color visualization schemes in which hybridization signal intensity is reflected by the color scale of vertical strips.\\nValidation of Norovirus Microarray Genotyping. To confirm the microarray genotyping result of the norovirus sample #186 (NoV#186), we performed a specific PCR with a published primer set G1SKF (5’-CTGCCCGAATTYGTAAATGA-3’) and G1SKR (5’-CCAACCCARCCATTRTACA-3’); G2SKF (5’-\\n34\\nCNTGGGAGGGCGATCGCAA-3’) and G2SKR (5’-CCRCCNGCATRHCCRTTRTACAT-3’; Y=C/T; N=A/T/G/C; R=A/G; H=A/T/C). This pair of primer was used for the amplification of genogroup I and group II norovirus. (Kojima, S., Kageyama, T., Fukushi, S.,et.al. (2002). Genogroup-specific PCR primers for detection of nowalk-like viruses. J Virol Methods. 100: 107-114.) The PCR was carried out as described previously (Kojima, S. above). The amplicon was sequenced and its relationship to known NoV strains were determined by phylogentics analysis program ClustalX as described by Thompson et. al. (1997). (Thompson J.D., Gibson,T.J., Plewniak,F., Jeanmougin,F. and Higgins,D.G. (1997) The CLUSTAL_X windows interface: flexible strategies for multiple sequence alignment aided by quality analysis tools. Nucleic Acids Res., 25, 4876–4882.). A phylogentic tree from boot-strap analysis was generated by Neibour-Joining method. Other norovirus samples were genotyped by Dr. William Burkhardt (FDA, Dauphin Island, AL) and by Dr. Jan Vinje (CDC, Atlanta, GA) via RT-PCR.\\nHybridization Profile of coxsackieviruses A and B and different strains of HAV\\n35\\nCXKV A2Fig 1.

\\n What is EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY ?\\n\\nEducational technology may be defined as the arrangement of tools in order, that might prove helpful in advancing student learning. It includes systems that are used in the process of developing human capability. Technology can refer to the materials, tools; that humans use. some modern tools include LCD projectors,Laptop and Computers. Technology also means "applied science". In other words, any valid and reliable process or procedure that is derived from basic research using scientific method is considered technology. So,educational technology may be extended to include the techniques of the educators.\\n\\n\\n What are the importance of Educational Technology?\\n\\nEducational technology is very important to the humanities. Today, the instructor doesn't need to be in the same room where the learner is. All they need is an internet connection and they are ready to have a session of teaching. Today, learning becomes more interesting with the use of streaming audio and video or a Powerpoint presentation with voice overs. With the emergence of advanced technology, it is important that educators use these tools to their advantage to not only make teaching easier and more interesting but also to acquire more knowledge to their students.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can get more information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology

After practicing law for 29+ years I am amazed that I seem to be the only counsel that has been consistently using the term "fraudulator" to define, generally, one who actively engages in fraudulent, deceptive, and misrepresentative type behavior.  Fraud is precisely defined in Federal and State statutes, and has become part of American and English lexicon in terms of "common law" deliberate deceptions for unfair and/or unlawful gain and advantage.  It is also generally defined as a swindle or a trick, and has been known to describe an imposter.\\n\\nBut, I have yet to see or read about anyone who is consistently or chronically involved in this type of conduct as being a "FRAUDULATOR".\\n\\nI believe this word should be added to common dictionaries and particularly "BLACK's LAW DICTIONARY" as a word that best articulates the true sense of the root-word, Fraud, when describing an individual and/or entity that engages in intentional fraudulent and deceptive conduct.  \\n\\nThank you in advance for your comments.

This is a great honor.
Individualist cultures are those in which people are on a whole loosely connected to each other and prefer to be identified as an individual. Self-importance, promotion, and achievement are highly valued. Competition is encouraged more than cooperation. Individualist cultures expect one to act for self-promotion and self-advancement in the job market. There is also competitiveness in social situations,where people are expected to fend for themselves and any sign of assistance (i.e. - getting set-up on a blind date)can be seen as a sign of weakness. Parental approval is helpful to have in situations such as marriage, but not necessary. People in an individualist culture place more importance on their own interests than the interests of other members of the culture.\\n\\nIndividualistic cultures place emphasis on the "I"consciousness.  These cultures are very competitive and self-centered, as opposed to the cooperation and loyalty focused values of a collectivist culture.  Individualistsvalue their privacy and usually indentify themselves as independent from the group indentity.  The JMU campus, for example, is largely individualistic.  The faculty, staff, and students of JMU are not necessarily unfriendly or unhelpful towards one another, but each student is competitive for the top grades and academic standing.  One will rarely ever witness a college student studying for hours on end in order to help his or her classmate achieve an A on an exam. Overall, individualist cultures emphasize individual goals,independence, privacy, and self-help.
'''Coral Reefs'''\\n     Coral reefs are very important ecosystems in our oceans. They are found in tropical areas that have clear, warm water. Coral reefs are formed by polyps that secrete hard calcareous exoskeletons, giving an amazingly firm structure. These colonial “hard corals” form elaborate finger-shaped, branching, or mound shaped structures and can create masses of limestone that stretch for tens or even hundreds of miles. These corals continue to build on top of the skeletal remains of older colonies and eventually a reef is established. Today, richly diverse coral reefs are found in the tropics along coastlines, on the margins of volcanic islands, and as isolated coral atolls. According to a website I found, coral reefs are home to over 25 percent of all marine life and are among the world's most fragile and endangered ecosystems. In the last few decades over 35 million acres of coral reefs have been destroyed and many other reefs have been damaged. One of the major threats to coral reefs is coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which corals lose their distinctive color because they expel the zooxanthellae that live within them. This bleaching is caused by stress to the corals. If a coral is fully bleached, it will turn entirely white, and will die unless the stress on the coral is reduced, allowing the zooxanthellae to return to the coral. The main causes of stress to the coral reefs are the rising water temperatures of the ocean and increased ultraviolet radiation. Two other factors that are believed to be causing stress to the reefs are increased salinity and increased sedimentation. Coral reefs are important, because they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and help regulate atmospheric temperatures, they protect our coastlines from erosion, act as homes to many marine animals, they are used for fishing, provide people with jobs, and of course they play a significant role in tourism.\\n\\nEnvironmental News Network staff.

---> Side 7\\n\\nLe Roy Ladurie has also worked on the history of French regions (''Histoire de France des régions'', 2004) and on [[anthropometric history]] as well as on the impact of climate changes on human history. Besides writing books, Le Roy Ladurie is a prolific essayist writing on variety of subjects such as the utility of computers as method of historical research, rates of delinquency in the French Army in the 19th century, the spread of global diseases and the belief of French peasants that magic could be used to generate impotence. The latter was a reference to the widespread practice of French peasant men in the Middle Ages and the early modern period of paying witches to use their (supposed) magical powers to make their rivals in love go impotent. Le Roy Ladurie is also known as one of the first modern [[environmental historian]]s because his work focused on human agency in environmental change, as well as environmental factors in human history.
see: www.PedroBOrtiz.com\\n\\nSince June 2010, the world has reached the threshold where more than 50% of its population lives in cities. Growth of many metropolitan urban areas is experiencing an annual growth of 4% to 6%. This means a doubling of population each 15 years. It now takes only 15 years to grow as much as the regions did during the past 400 years. This phenomena is not natural growth nor even rapid growth. It can only be defined as explosive growth.\\n\\nThis phenomenon must be controlled to avoid the metastasis of slums that's currently taking place. If this is not addressed, these metropolises will be unsustainable and will not be incapable of competing in global markets. The World Bank is addressing this critical issue through its Urban Unit of the Sustainable Development Network, supporting the work done throughout the world by the Region Units (LAC, MENA, SSA, ECA, SEA, EPA). \\n\\nPedro Ortiz introduced a metropolitan growth methodology in the 1996 when he developed the Madrid Regional Plan, (the ORT, (Ordenacion Reticular del Territorio). This plan addressed the explosive growth Madrid was experiencing at that time (50% every 20 years). It was successful in controlling and monitoring the the city's growth in a sustainable manner (Spatial and Transport integrated policies). This methodology (Smart Metropolises: MetroCT Method) is now being enhanced and applied to numerous metropolises globally.
==Quantitative Taxonomy of Wikipedia Editors==\\n\\n===Abstract===\\nSome quantitative methods for categorizing Wikipedia editors and their editing styles are described. \\n\\n===Introduction===\\nWikipedia is one of the most popular websites on the internet. It is composed of several million articles written in over 250 different languages. Wikipedia is created by  thousands of volunteer editors, who are guided by a set of policies, principles, guidelines, conventions and traditions. Different editors are involved in a wide variety of tasks, and exhibit different editing styles. \\n\\nThere are many reasons to categorize editing styles on Wikipedia. For example, not all editing styles contribute equally to the production of Wikipedia, and it is valuable to understand which styles are more useful to Wikipedia and in what circumstances. Recognizing unproductive or inefficient behavior and measuring it's characteristics  can be useful in the creation of evidence-based management systems, which hopefully will replace the current intuition-based management systems. For example, when selecting editors for promotion to administrative positions, or other positions of responsibility, current methods can skew the selection process towards those with limited forms of editing experience. Gauging editing styles and experiences can allow a conscious decision to avoid certain kinds of editors, to create a wider diversity of candidates, or to otherwise assist in the selection process. Also, measuring the results of certain administrative actions or imposition of policy changes can be valuable information for evaluating the appropriateness of these actions and changes.\\n\\nQuantitative methods of analysis are often desirable. Quantitative methods are amenable to automation and computer implementation, which is appropriate for a computer-based document production project.  Numerically-based procedures can reveal features of situations that are not readily apparent to less exacting and rigorous methods.
Our Children’s Place is a non-profit organization which aims at allowing young children, mostly infants and preschoolers to live with their mothers while the women serve out their sentences for nonviolent offenses. This initiative breaks the cycle of crime, poverty, substance abuse and family violence among generations as well as empowers the child with the help of his/her mother to enhance his/her social, cognitive, physical and emotional development. Ultimately, this project could allow many children to develop better inter-personal skills for their future by interacting with their mothers and will allow them a better chance at a successful future. Our Children’s Place was spear-headed by North Carolina Senator Ellie Kinniard in 2004. They are finally completing construction on a $3.5 million facility that will be able to hold ten women and twenty children, which will open in 2010. These women must be serving a sentence of three years or less and must be convicted of a non-violent crime. The children will receive free childcare, in addition to sessions with therapists and other health professionals. Our Children’s Place also works with H.A.T.S. (Handcrafted And Totally Special), an organization that allows female inmates and community members to create hats and other items.\\n\\n<ref></ref>http://ourchildrensplace.com/

I take a special interest in the history and science of cancer bacteria research. I have avidly studied this field for twenty five years, have conducted myriad interviews, initiated correspondences with leading and independent cancer organizations including NCI and ACS, and have compiled a sizeable library of published research, correspondences, audio tapes of interviews and newspaper records dating back to early 20th century.\\n\\nOver the years, I have grown from someone opinionated on the topic of "alternative medicine," to someone who has become totally dedicated to judicious presentation of facts and historical records, well aware of the many myths, half-truths and conjectures that exist regarding this subject. Unfortunatley, there is a fair amount of distorted information about cancer bacteria research both in the popular mainstream, and among so-called "advocates." Thus I feel it an obligation as a published author and medical journalist, to convey the highest quality information I am able in the hopes of promoting a better dialogue.
An essential role of Open Access is the long-term preservation of peer-reviewed scholarly journal articles and research data. Submit your scientific, medical and technical researches for publishing. Promotion of Open Access is very crucial to encourage innovation, sociology-economic development, and flow of knowledge around the world. As such, Open Access can be defined as an instrument ultimately used for public welfare to stimulate the growth of global science, as well as maintain the quality of scientific achievements at the same time.
What UP does:\\n\\nUP is a group of under-30s based in London in the UK who want to support people of their own age affected by depression. Their aim is to raise awareness of depression, promote understanding of mental health issues and work to reduce the stigma that might prevent depression sufferers seeking help. UP is there to encourage seeking the best support to help individuals, families and friends learn to overcome the illness, improve quality of life and realise potential.\\n\\nUP is part of the Charlie Waller Memorial Trust (CWMT).\\n\\nWhy target young people?\\n\\nDepression is widespread among the under-30s. This age group often struggle to cope with the pressures of education, work, money, relationships and simply finding their way in the world. Sadly, it is also the age group most likely to try to cover up any mental health issues.\\n\\nUnwarranted shame, lack of information or believing that this age group should just ’pull their socks up‘ mean that they’re often unable to admit to friends, family or even themselves that something’s wrong. But with depression, something is badly wrong.\\n\\nUP believes it shouldn’t be this way. UP promotes finding the correct treatment, that really works; currently in the UK there’s no clear path to getting help. Often the most common answer to the question “what would you do if you felt depressed, or worried that a friend might be?” is “I don’t know”. UP wants to answer that question and provide a gateway to the support that may be needed.
                                      '''\\n                                        '''''Contemporary society''''' ''                \\n\\nContemporary society, according to social and political scientists, is characterised by at least three fundamental directions:\\n* '''increasing human interconnection''' through a network of relationships that is progressively covering the whole planet;\\n* '''the pace and depth of the evolution of human ways of life''' determined by technological innovation represent an absolute novelty in human history;\\n* the scale of '''anthropological and and ecological transformation''' due to the interaction between evolutionary factors (social, cultural, economic, and technological) has no historical precedent.\\n\\nThese directions are the result of a number of fundamental changes that are irreversibly transforming our daily lives, our way of thinking and perceiving the world and our way of living together. Among these fundamental changes are: improvements in life conditions, life expectancy, literacy and gender equality; changes in domestic and international political institutions; and the breakdown of natural equilibria.\\n\\n\\n==Improvement of life conditions==\\nThe UN estimates that, at the beginning of the 20th century, about 60% of the world population lived in conditions of extreme poverty. In 1981, 40% of the world population lived extreme poverty. In 2001, the percentage had been halved to 20%.\\nSeveral developing countries, in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa, still suffer from social and economic backwardness, but life conditions have significantly improved in most regions of the world, in particular in Asia. \\nThe overall improvement in life conditions and the role of technologies now available have contributed to increase GDP per capita by one and a half times in less than half a century (1960-2005), with peaks of over eight times in Eastern Asia. Only in a few countries, concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, growth of per capita income has been very slow.\\n\\n\\n==Life expectancy==\\nIn 1960, the average life expectancy of the world population was 50 years. Forty-five years later, in 2004, life expectancy had improved by over 30% to 67 years. Improvements in health care and the reduction in child mortality have led to a jump forward in middle-income countries, where life expectancy is now over 70 years. In high-income countries life expectancy is now over 80 years, extending well beyond the traditional length of working life, causing social and economic problems.\\n\\n\\n==Literacy and gender equality==\\nThe ability to read and write is next to universal: in 2004, 80% of adult men and 73% of adult women had basic literacy skills. Of great social importance is the rapid growth of female school enrollment and the increasing presence of women in the labour market. These deep changes constitute a primary driver of economic growth in developing countries.\\nFemale literacy has great consequences in terms of fertility. When female school enrollment and employment rates increase, fertility rates decline rapidly and tend to stabilise around the natural rate of reproduction of 2.1 children per women (see E. Todd, "After the Empire"). Several demographers believe that, as a consequence, world population will stabilise over the next few decades, at a level compatible with the resources of the planet [reference].\\n\\n\\n==Spread of communication technologies==\\nThe world population has a number of "passive" (broadcasting) communication technologies (radio, television) that cover the whole globe. Moreover, a large portion of the population uses "active" commmunication technologies (telephone, internet). Internet connections are expanding rapidly: in 2004 there were 140 Internet users every 1000 inhabitants (according to data from the "International Communication Union"). The spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) is remodelling the material fundaments of society. The sociologist [[Manuel_Castells|Castells]] believes that these technologies have started a revolution of the productive structures of society and of daily life.\\n\\nThe new communication technologies represent a critical instrument to obtain consensus and as a result they are transforming the organisational models of the State and of politics. The power system becomes less visible but more pervasive in the way it can influence choices and ways of thinking Manuel_Castells|M. Castells]], "Galassia Internet", Feltrinelli, [[2002]]).\\n\\n\\n==Economic growth and evolution of political institutions==\\nThe economic success of authoritarian regimes, mainly in Asia, suggests that (at least in the short term) economic growth is independent from the democratisation of political institutions. However, economic development favours the development of democratic institutions--but only if economic growth leads to substantial changes in cultural and social structures. ([[Ronald Inglehart|R. Inglehart]], "La società postmoderna").\\nThe "World Values Survey", which captures political values in 43 countries, shows that no country with a per capita income below the poverty line has democratic or free institutions. Almost the totality of nations with high per capita income are classified as democratic.\\n\\n==Globalisation==\\nOver the last fifty years, world GDP has increased by about five times, while trade has increased ten-fold over the same period. These data suggests that the intensity of the commercial exchange between countries has developed faster than the overall economy. However, globalisation has gone beyond the exchange of physical commodities and it is progressively modelling also the lifestyles and consumption patterns of individuals and societies. The Swiss think-tank KOF has developed a number of globalisation indicators that show the increasing development of global individual, social and commercial networks.\\n\\n\\n==Social tension and opposition to change==\\nNew international flows have diminished the role of traditional political institutions--sometimes with negative consequences for social stability. In many societies, stability (or slow evolution) has been substituted by unstoppable and irreversable transformations.\\nAs a result, individuals and communities perceive a high degree of insecurity--insecurity that touches every aspect of their lives. Growing masses of people feel threatened by the changes that affect their material (work, income, house), psychological (personal relationships), and cultural life (with the need to continuously update knowledge and professional skills)[[Digital divide|it.Wikipedia.org "Digital divide"]]).\\nThe social improvement of the masses --resulting from increasing literacy and income, universal means of communication and a new social role of women-- has eroded the traditional role of the elites and have weakened the traditional regulatory role of the state.\\nAs the speed of social and cultural evolution sweeps away old life habits, religious beliefs, ancestral moral convictions and radicated political opinions, the anxiety towards a future that is mutating and unknown causes a cultural opposition that is at the root of fundamentalism. Opposition against new life conditions is justified also by increasing economic inequality: "the gap between the wealth of the North and that of the South of the world has increased by a multiple of five since the beginning of the XX century" ({{in lang|fr}} [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cohen_%28%C3%A9conomiste%29 Daniel Cohen], "Trois leçons sur la société postindustrielle").\\n\\n\\n==Breakdown of natural equilibria==\\nWhen demographic growth is multiplied by the growth of per capita income and consumption, one can have a measure of the global impact on environmental sustainability. Demographic and economic development is endangering our current forms of civilisation and social co-living and our future ability to inhabit our planet.\\nAlternative scenarios developed by international organisations suggest the possibility of a serious breakdown of natural equilibrium unless political, scientific and economic tools are directed to a correction towards an acceptable equilibrium between humankind and with nature.\\n\\n\\n== Related voices==\\n* {{in lang|en}} [[:en:Samir Amin|Samir Amin]]\\n* [[Zygmunt Bauman]]\\n* [[Manuel Castells]]\\n* [[Derrick de Kerckhove]]\\n* [[Anthony Giddens]]\\n* [[Jack Goody]]\\n* [[Ronald Inglehart]]\\n* [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Levy]]\\n* [[Nicholas Negroponte]]\\n* [[Emmanuel Todd]]\\n* [[Immanuel Wallerstein]]\\n* {{in lang|en}} [[:en:Martin Wolf|Martin Wolf]]\\n* [[Postmaterialismo]]\\n* {{in lang|ca}} [http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moviments_socials Moviments socials]\\n\\n==Sources==\\n* World Bank: World Development Indicators Online database [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20398986~menuPK:64133163~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html]\\n* World Bank: Social Indicators of Development 2004\\n* World Bank: Data & Statistics, 2001\\n* World Bank: International Telecommunications Union\\n* Human Development Index\\n* UNO Yearbook 2004\\n* World Value Survey\\n* Eurobarometro\\n* Konjunkturforschungsstelle (KOF): Index of Globalization 2004\\n* International Monetary Fund: World Economic and Financial Survey 2006\\n* UNESCO/OECD: World Education Indicators Programme 1999\\n* United Nations Development Program: Human Development Report 2004\\n* United Nations Population Division: World Population Prospect, 2000\\n\\n==Bibliography (in Italian)==\\n* Krishan Kumar, "Le nuove teorie del mondo contemporaneo" 2000\\n* Martin Wolf, "Perché la globalizzazione funziona" 2006\\n* Ulrich Beck, "Cos'è la globalizzazione" 1999\\n* Peter Sloterdijk, "Breve storia filosofica della globalizzazione" 2002\\n* Peter Sloterdijk, "La morte nel postumanismo" 2004\\n* Peter Sloterdijk, "Non siamo ancora stati salvati" 2001\\n* Jack Goody, "Capitalismo e modernità" 2005\\n* Samir Amin, "Il capitalismo nell'era della globalizzazione" 1997\\n* Zygmunt Bauman, "Dentro la globalizzazione" 2001\\n* Pierre Lévy, "les tecnologies de l'intelligence" 1990\\n* Nicholas Negroponte, "Essere digitali" 1990\\n* Manuel Castells, "Il potere dell'identità" 2003\\n* Manuel Castells, "Galassia internet" 2002\\n* Manuel Castells, "La nascita della società in rete" 2002\\n* Derrick de Kerckhove (a cura di), "Brainframes" 1991\\n* Mark Dery, "Velocità di fuga" 1997\\n* Kevin Robins, "Oltre l'immagine" 1999\\n* Remo Bodei, "Destini personali" 2002\\n* Michel Foucault, "Tecnologie del sè" 1992\\n* Antony Giddens, "La Trasformazione dell'intimità" 1995\\n* Emmanuel Todd, "Dopo l'impero" 2003\\n* Ronald Inglehart, "La società postmoderna" 1998\\n* Daniel Cohen, " Trois leçons sur la société postindustrielle" 2005
=World War II: Mobilization=\\n<br/>\\n==Introduction==\\n<br/>\\n   World War II was the largest and most violent armed conflict in the history of mankind. However, the half century that now separates \\nus from that conflict has exacted its toll on our collective knowledge. While World War II continues to absorb the interest of military scholars and historians, as well as its veterans, a generation of Americans has grown to maturity largely unaware of the political, social, and military implications of a war that, more than any other, united us as a people with a common purpose.\\n\\n \\n\\n   Highly relevant today, World War II has much to teach us, not only about the profession of arms, but also about military preparedness, global strategy, and combined operations in the coalition war against fascism. During the next several years, the U.S. Army will participate in the nation's 50th anniversary commemoration of World War II. The commemoration will include the publication of various materials to help educate Americans about that war. The works produced will provide great opportunities to learn about and renew pride in an Army that fought so magnificently in what has been called "the mighty endeavor."\\n\\n \\n\\nWorld War II was waged on land on sea, and in the air over several diverse theaters of operation for approximately six years. The following essay on the wartime mobilization effort supplements a series of studies on the Army's campaigns of that war.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis brochure was prepared in the U.S. Army Center of Military History by Frank N. Schubert. I hope this absorbing account of that period will enhance your appreciation of American achievements during World War II.\\n\\n \\n\\nGORDON R.

'''What is Sustainable Tourism?'''\\n\\nSustainable tourism is a form of tourism that provides economic, social, and environmental benefits through the knowledgeable management of tourism resources. Long-term sustainability is achieved without losing any local cultural identity or natural values.\\n\\nBoth tourist operators and tourists can help achieve sustainable tourism.\\n\\n'''What kinds of tourism are sustainable?'''\\n \\nECOTOURISM : Ecotourism is a form of tourism that occurs in natural areas and integrates the local socio-cultural identity with ecosystem considerations. It promotes a sustainable ecosystem through a participatory environmental management processes involving all stakeholders.\\n \\nHEALTH TOURISM : Health tourism is a form of tourism involving activities that deliberately promote good health. Examples of health tourism include visiting exercise or meditation centres or resorts that provide health services or specialise in vegetariam food. Such visits are typically of a specified duration, such as 3,5, or 7 days.\\n \\nAGROTOURISM : Agrotourism is a form of tourism in agricultural areas such as orchards, agroforestry farms, herbal farms and animal farms, which have been prepared in some way for the tourists. More importantly, tourists gain experience in farming activities such as working with animals or harvesting crops, usually under the supervision of a farm guide. Lecture describing the operation of the farm may also be given.\\n \\nCULTURAL TOURISM : Cultural tourism is a form of tourism that allows tourists to admire and learn about local cultures and tradition. The local community participates in the management of this form of tourism, which is based on the principle of conserving local culture and the environment. Examples of culture-based tourism include visiting the Royal Court or experiencing local life in a hill-tribe village\\n\\n'''Every kind of existing tourism operation can become Sustainable Tourism if tourism managers take responsibility for the destinations socio-cultural and natural environment.'''
== Nigerian Public Policy ==\\n\\nBy: Hannah Viertel, Taylor Stein, and Karli Lutton\\n\\n\\na. Three facts from today's reading\\n\\n1) The reason most Nigerians live in debt is due to Nigeria’s large dependence on oil revenue. Instead of the people benefiting from the oil revenue, the government officials pocket all of the money, leaving their people in poverty. \\n\\n2) Most Nigerians support federalism; they want any power to be shared and they want to be able to contact their government which would in turn create a true democratic rule. Many southerners point out that federalism can only exist if the central government gives some of its power to state and local governments.\\n\\n3) After international oil prices plummeted in the early 1980's, Nigeria was forced to turn to international organizations for help in managing its huge national debt. In 1985, the Babangida regime developed an economic restructural adjustment program with the support of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The program sought to restructure and diversify the Nigerian economy so that it could decrease its dependence on oil.\\n\\n\\nb. Three assumptions from today's reading\\n\\n1) The government of Nigeria operates under a patron-clientelism system in which the military and political elite operate with only their self interest in mind. State control of resources means that those in the pyramid get the spoils and they alone have access to wealth and influence.\\n\\n2) Southerners protested the practice of revenue sharing because they do not trust the government and therefore no one believed that the profits would benefit anyone except corrupt government officials.\\n\\n3) Northerners generally don't support the true federalism movement with regions controlling their own resources because their regions historically have not had as many resources or as much revenue to share.  Many northern states benefit more than southerners from nationally sponsored redistribution programs.\\n\\n\\nc. Three unanswered questions from today's reading\\n\\n1) Will Nigeria be able to remain together as a nation despite their lack of a coherent national identity?\\n\\n2) Will Nigeria ever be able to diversify its economy and not rely solely on oil?\\n\\n3) Is it possible for Nigeria to change from its system of patron-clientelism to establish a true democracy?
{{Userspace draft|source=ArticleWizard|date=December 2009}}\\n\\n'''KOMAZA''' is a not-for-profit social enterprise working to end rural poverty and unlock economic opportunities for smallholder farmers living in Kenya’s semi-arid climates. \\n\\nFounded in 2006 by Tevis Howard, the organization has developed an innovative grassroots model that generates an unprecedented amount of income for rural families by helping them plant cash crops on previously degraded land. These crops are then harvested, processed and sold to high-value markets.\\n\\nDue to the dry, semi-arid conditions of Coastal Kenya, most people struggle to subsist on poor harvests from drought-prone, infertile land. Because families cannot generate enough money to survive, they have also grown more reliant on the unsustainable use of natural resources, leaving agricultural livelihoods in further peril. This leads to a perpetual cycle of extreme poverty and irreversible deforestation.  \\nIn response to these challenges, KOMAZA has developed intensive microforestry programs, combining microfinance, forestry and family farming.  After identifying interested farmer groups under the advice and consent of community leadership, KOMAZA provides farmers with appropriate farm inputs and tools on credit – such as improved seeds, fertilizer and irrigation technologies.  Then, working through an extension network of more than 50 field staff, KOMAZA offers on-farm training and support as well as complete vertically integrated value capture services so that farmers can access markets and earn a profit.  Farmers can then reinvest this profit to start their own business, pay school fees for their children and receive improved healthcare.  \\n\\nThe organization’s portfolio of crops provides both an immediate and permanent increase in annual income to improve basic life conditions and also yields large lump-sum capital for families to reinvest in major life improvements.  According to KOMAZA, its farm families can earn the equivalent of ten to twenty years’ income over the eight-year lifespan of a half-acre tree farm. KOMAZA has also established two industry-leading experimental farms to research agricultural best-practices for semi-arid farmers. \\n\\nKOMAZA (Swahili for "promote development; encourage growth") is based in Kilifi, Kenya.  As of December 2009, the organization has partnered with nearly 500 farm families, benefiting X.  KOMAZA plans to significantly expand its operations in Kenya to reach 10,000 farmers by the end of 2012.  \\n\\nKOMAZA is registered as a 501(c) 3 charitable organization in the United States and incorporated in the State of California.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n== External links ==\\n* [http://www.example.com/ example.com] \\n\\n\\n<!--- Categories --->
'''Non-kinetic operations'''\\n\\n"active, as opposed to latent." Dropping bombs and shooting bullets—you know, killing people—is kinetic. But the 21st-century military is exploring less violent and more high-tech means of warfare, such as messing electronically with the enemy's communications equipment or wiping out its bank accounts. These are "non-kinetic."\\n\\n\\nThe kinetic part is easily defined: using the military to kill\\nterrorists “with a global reach,” disrupt their infrastructure,\\nand dissuade those who fund terrorists and their state sponsors upon threat (and occasionally actual visitation) of physical injury.\\n\\nThe nonkinetic parts are often euphemized as the “drain\\nthe swamp” or, better, the “hearts and minds” problem. These\\nnonmilitary aspects focus on terrorism’s motivation and\\nrecruitment patterns, the sociology of terrorist groups that\\nleads them to mobilize, compete, and strike; and the underlying social conditions said to feed that motivation and those\\nrecruitment patterns.\\n\\n\\nGetting at the nonkinetic aspects of the war on terrorism\\ncan be conceived as consisting of immediate, midterm, and\\nlong-term parts. The essence at all stages, however, appears to\\nbe fourfold:\\n#Stigmatize the idea of murdering civilians for any political cause whatsoever, just as slavery, piracy, and human ritual sacrifice were so stigmatized in previous generations.\\n#Identify and stop the flow of money and other resources at all levels from those who approve of terrorism to those who carry it out, redirecting that money and those resources to positive ends, as possible.\\n#Refute, tirelessly and skillfully, the almost endless distortions of U.S. policies and motivations that are promulgated by Islamist propagandists (and others) and that inexorably make Americans and their allies targets of hatred and violence.\\n#Work patiently at social, economic, and political reform (generally in that order) in Muslim-majority countries and among Muslim communities outside the Middle East and South Asia where terrorist cadres are known to have arisen.\\n\\n\\nNonkinetic operations. Training units in non-kinetic operations requires establishing an environment in which human terrain predominates. In such an environment, units can employ nonkinetic resources such as civil affairs (CA) and psychological operations (PSYOP) teams and public affairs officers; and they can conduct leader engagements, disburse money, and participate in reconstruction. to provide the human terrain necessary to train nonkinetic operations, the NTC populates its towns and villages with up to 1,600 role players, of which 250 are Iraqi-Americans who remain in their roles and live in the field for the entire 14-day training event. Each role player is influenced by respective tribal and religious leaders and maintains familial, social, and business relationships throughout the rotation. Some role players have businesses and jobs; others are unemployed and disenfranchised, ripe for insurgent recruitment. Each urban area has its own government structure, police force, businesses, criminal element, and ethnic tension. Provincial government and police forces also exert influence on towns and villages.\\n\\nThe human terrain element makes leaders and soldiers engage with real Iraqis, a function that requires them to adapt to Iraqi culture and seek cooperation. Leaders conduct engagements and negotiate with provincial, town, and tribal leaders to gather information on insurgent activity and to find out who can create jobs, provide medical aid, or develop reconstruction projects. The human element also allows the training unit to employ CA and PSYOP teams throughout its area of operations to influence the role players. Iraqi role players' attitudes change based on unit actions.\\n\\nThe recently constructed Joint coordination center, modeled after facilities in theater, is the focal point of nonkinetic operations. It serves as a coordination center for those acting as coalition forces; Iraqi security forces; local government, tribal and religious leaders; local security and medical personnel; and nongovernmental organization (NGO) workers.\\n\\n\\na Kinetic warfare situation where we are in all out war: dropping bombs, rolling in with tanks, shooting everything that moves. We have since moved on from a Kinetic warfare situation to a Expanded Warfare situation where our primary concerns are to maintain order, repair infrastructure, implement domestic services, and conduct warfare operations against those that wish to disrupt the previous objectives.
     Did you know that there is another disastrous event aside from global warming?\\nIt is called global dimming.Global dimming is the gradual reduction in the amount of global hemispherical irradiance (or total solar irradiance) at the Earth's surface, observed since the beginning of systematic measurements in 1950s. The effect varies by location, but worldwide it is of the order of a 5% reduction over the three decades from 1960–1990. This trend has reversed during the past decade. Global dimming creates a cooling effect that may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.\\n\\n     It is currently thought that the effect of global dimming is probably due to the increased presence of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Aerosol particles and other particulate pollutants absorb solar energy and reflect sunlight back into space. The pollutants can also become nuclei for cloud droplets. It is thought that the water droplets in clouds coalesce around the particles. Increased pollution, resulting in more particulates, creates clouds consisting of a greater number of smaller droplets, which in turn makes them more reflective, therefore bouncing more sunlight back into space.\\n\\n     Clouds intercept both heat from the sun and heat radiated from the Earth. Their effects are complex and vary in time, location and altitude. Usually during the daytime the interception of sunlight predominates, giving a cooling effect; however, at night the re-radiation of heat to the Earth slows the Earth's heat loss.\\n\\n     Early reports of "global dimming" attracted little interest, perhaps because the term itself had not yet been coined. The earliest reports seem to be by M. Budyko: "The effect of solar radiation variations on the climate of the Earth" in 1969, published in Tellus. From the late 1980s onwards, scientists independently began working on solar radiation datasets and discovered declining trends worldwide; Atsumo Ohmura Secular variation of global radiation in Europe in 1989; Vivii Russak in 1990 "Trends of solar radiation, cloudiness and atmospheric transparency during recent decades in Estonia", and Beate Liepert in 1994 "Solar radiation in Germany - Observed trends and an assessment of their causes". Gerry Stanhill who studied these declines worldwide in many papers coined the term "dimming". Dimming exists in sites all over the Former Soviet Union.\\n\\n     Independent research in Israel and the Netherlands in the late 1980s showed an apparent reduction in the amount of sunlight, despite widespread evidence that the climate was actually becoming hotter. The rate of dimming varies around the world but is on average estimated at around 2–3% per decade, with the possibility that the trend reversed in the early 1990s. It is difficult to make a precise measurement, due to the difficulty in accurately calibrating the instruments used, and the problem of spatial coverage. Nonetheless, the effect is almost certainly present.\\n\\n     The effect is due to changes within the Earth's atmosphere; the value of the solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere has not changed by more than a fraction of this amount.
 I am a Sri Lankan native and currently affiliated \\nat the Asian Studies and Department of Political Science, Temple University, Philadelphia. I teach courses on comparative politics such as nationalism and ethnic conflict and foreign governments and politics. Also, teach courses on modern China and Modern India.\\n\\nMy studies cover two major aspects: the symbolic politics of elites and\\npoliticization of ethnic differences, especially in Sri Lanka. My most\\nrecent research examines issues pertaining to Muslims in Sri Lanka and Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region in China. My scholarly pursuit has born fruit as publications in leading journals in my areas of study, such as Journal of South Asia, the Journal of Asian and African Studies (JAAS),the Journal of Third World Studies (JTWS) and Asian Affairs. In addition,I have published a number of research findings in international newspapers.\\n\\nIn recent years, my research has been concerned with the rising religious\\ntrends in South Asia and Middle East. Over the next few years, my project\\nwould focus on religious illiberalism and its inherent challenges to\\nsecular regimes and political actors in South Asia and the Middle East.
Physics (Greek: physis – φύσις meaning "nature") is a natural science that involves the study of matter, its motion through spacetime, and all allied components, such as energy and force. This has led to the discovery and understanding of the laws and principles which govern the physical universe. More broadly, Physics is the general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the world and universe behave. One tool which helps with this general analysis is the study of the elementary constituents of the universe and their interactions.\\n\\nPhysics is one of the oldest academic disciplines, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy. Evidence exists that the earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000 BCE, such as the Sumerians, Ancient Egyptians, and the Indus Valley Civilization, all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. Although originally part of other physical sciences and mathematics, Physics emerged to become a unique modern science during the Scientific Revolution of the 16th century.\\n\\nPhysics is both significant and influential, in part because advances in its understanding have often translated into new technologies, but also because new ideas in physics often resonate with other sciences, mathematics, and philosophy. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products which have dramatically transformed modern-day society (e.g., television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons); advances in thermodynamics led to the development of motorized transport; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.\\n\\nPhysics also has philosophical implications. It can be historically traced back to ancient Greek philosophy. From Thales' first attempt to characterize matter, to Democritus' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state, the Ptolemaic astronomy of a crystalline firmament, and Aristotle's book Physics, different Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature. Well into the 18th century, physics was known as "Natural philosophy". By the 19th century physics was realized as a positive science and a distinct discipline separate from philosophy and the other sciences. Physics, as with the rest of science, relies on philosophy of science to give an adequate description of the scientific method.\\n\\n\\nMore about physics\\nedit  \\nSelected article\\nPortrait of Galileo Galilei by Giusto Sustermans\\n\\n    Galileo Galilei was an Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who played a major role in the Scientific Revolution. His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations and support for Copernicanism. Galileo has been called the "father of modern observational astronomy", the "father of modern physics", the "father of science", and "the Father of Modern Science".\\n\\nHis contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter (named the Galilean moons in his honour), and the observation and analysis of sunspots. Galileo also worked in applied science and technology, inventing an improved military compass and other instruments.\\n\\nGalileo's championing of heliocentrism was controversial within his lifetime, when most subscribed to either geocentrism or the Tychonic system.[9] He met with opposition from astronomers, who doubted heliocentrism due to the absence of an observed stellar parallax. The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, and they concluded that it could only be supported as a possibility, not as an established fact. Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point. He was tried by the Inquisition, found "vehemently suspect of heresy", forced to recant, and spent the rest of his life under house arrest. It was while Galileo was under house arrest that he wrote one of his finest works, Two New Sciences. Here he summarized the work he had done some forty years earlier, on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials.\\n\\n    Classical mechanics describes the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, as well as astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, stars, and galaxies. Within these domains, it produces very accurate results. And thus, is one of the oldest and largest subjects in science, engineering and technology. Besides this, many related specialties deal with gases, liquids, and solids, and so on. In addition, classical mechanics is enhanced by special relativity for high velocity objects that are approaching the speed of light. General relativity is employed to handle gravitation at a deeper level, and finally, quantum mechanics handles the wave-particle duality of atoms and molecules.\\n\\nMore selected articles\\nedit  \\nSelected picture\\n\\nThe Hubble Deep Field (HDF) is an image of a small region in the constellation Ursa Major, constructed from a series of observations by the Hubble Space Telescope.

Hi,\\n\\nI'm a newbie here, so please forgive me as I learn.\\n\\nThe travelogue film has a rich culture and history, which has been largely ignored by other film-related discussions. Indeed, the travelogue film was one of the earliest forms of filmmaking. It is, however, a hybrid art form, a combination of filmmaking, lecturing, entertainment, education, and performing art. Travelogue filmmakers make their films almost entirely alone or with a partner, relative, friend or spouse, without the aid of large crews, or, generally speaking, outside funding. They present an overview of a country or region, featuring its industry and culture, and travel around the continent showing their films and presenting them to the audience at a live theatrical event.\\n\\nI am a former Travel Adventure Film (Travelogue) Artist and I am interested in collaborating on articles relating to the history and culture of this unique and little-understood artform, and the unique, individual film artists who have produced them over the last century and more.
               The spate of recent terrorist attacks on Bombay only goes to evince the fact as to how vulnerable the megalopolis was for such unsuspected assaults that left as many as 180 people dead ,and about 200 wounded in the carnage perpetrated by the assailants.Though the intelligent inputs clearly indicated such possible assaults by the terrorists,no preventive steps were taken either by the Center or by the state government which turned pathetically helpless to defend its citizens, and became susceptible to the vitriolic criticism by the people across the country.A few face- saving measures were initiated to pacify the groundswell of peoples' anger.The change of a home minister or the ousting of a chief minister will not absolve the government of the sins of omission or commission unless a foolproof defensive mechanism is in order.India needs to fortify its intelligence wing, and make it much more accountable.The gross failure to warn the Indian leadership of the possible terrorist attacks only leaves wide gaps in the defence of the country.Every citizen needs to be protected since the constitution guarantees the fundamental right to live ,and the present governement has perforce to answer why it has woefully failed to protect its people.\\n\\nBy Dr Karanamrao

== North American Carbon Exchange ==\\n\\nThe [http://www.NoCarbEx.com North American Carbon Exchange NoCarbEx.com] is a voluntary "[[carbon_credit]]" exchange.  NoCarbEx purchases carbon credits from individuals and businesses planting trees to reduce greenhouse gases.  The Exchange bundles the shares of carbon credits and resells them to help businesses offset their carbon footprint. \\n\\n=== Lowering Greenhouse Gases ===\\nRising world levels of CO2 ([[Greenhouse effect]]) from fossil fuel emissions is a major cause of global warming. It is widely accepted that global temperature is increasing because world levels of CO2 are rising. The majority of the CO2 is produced by human activity, specifically by the burning of fossil fuels in power plants, automobiles, and deforestation.\\n\\nLowering these CO2 levels is being addressed by two major approaches. Non-fossil fuel approaches include nuclear, wind, and solar. Removing CO2 from the atmosphere is possible by planting trees. Wood, almost half carbon, provides one of the most commercially viable approaches for sequestering massive amounts of carbon dioxide. The world marketplace has existed since 2004 for carbon sequestration.  The largest US marketplace for voluntary carbon credits is the [[Chicago_Climate_Exchange]].\\n\\n=== Individual Participation in Carbon Credit Trading ===\\nThe North American Carbon Exchange allows individuals to participate in the voluntary carbon markets by providing financial incentives for [[afforestation]]. The Exchange has its own methodology to measure and transparently verify that all carbon dioxide offsets are additional and permanent. The NoCarbEx methodology fully complies or exceeds the principles of all major global warming regulatory regimes (i.e., the [[Kyoto_treaty]], the California Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and most of the draft US Federal Legislation). These principles are:\\n\\nAdditionality. From the perspective of global warming, offsets need to be additional and result in a net decrease of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In other words, the sequestration of greenhouse gases needs to happen in addition to what would happen in the absence of the intervention. \\n\\nLeakage. It is important to ensure that the additional carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere is not emitted elsewhere as a result of the planting of new trees. \\n\\nPermanence. The carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by growing trees needs to become "permanently" sequestered. NoCarbEx participants commit to keep the trees planted for a minimum of 40 years and pay a penalty if the tree is removed before this time. \\n\\nVerification. Every single tree registered with NoCarbEx has a technical data-sheet that is maintained by NoCarbEx showing the type of tree and its expected growth and carbon sequestration potential. All NoCarbEx trees are geo-referenced and can be found easily through Google or other mapping software.\\n\\n==Copyright problems==\\n[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|left|48px|]]Hello.

Ascaphus is the genus of primitive frogs that inhabit the mountain streams of northwestern North America.  However these frogs are not limited to streams but seasonally migrate upslope into the adjacent conifer forest, and so the habitat of these frogs is forested watersheds, not just streams.  The streams do need to have interstitial spaces under rocks.  If silt fills the interstitial spaces then the frogs and tadpoles have no cover and cannot survive.  The width of a riparian reserve should be what is needed to protect the stream from mud released by logging and related ground-disturbing activities, but ideally entire watersheds should be reserved - and protected from logging and road construction.
Censorship is a rather broad umbrella term. Just like communism, 100% no censorship is a grand idea, but it just doesn't work at that level. Being able to protest and march and speak as one pleases are good things not to censor. Having any book available to check-out at your local library is another good example. But where is the line drawn? In the United States, persons under the age of twenty-one cannot consume alcohol, and for most of the country, persons under the age of sixteen cannot operate automobiles on public streets and highways. Is this censorship? In the same country, pornography cannot be viewed and cigarettes cannot be smoked by persons under the age of eighteen. Although I do not consider the photograph in question as pornography, it is pretty darn close. As an umbrella term, "no censorship" can apply to anything. All rules and laws (Including the ones Wikipedia stands by) can be seen as censorship.
