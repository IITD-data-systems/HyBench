Urban Photography is a popular form of photography documenting modern life within any populated geographic location. This form of photography tends to capture everyday life, seemingly from a first-hand account. It can be described as the combination of landscape and documentary photography. While documentary photography is very similar, urban photography generally does not capture a specific event or cause. Typical works of urban photography will feature city skylines, city-life, buildings, cars and people. This form of photography is especially popular among bloggers and amateur photographers.
We envision a resilient and independently sustainable Prince Rupert, capable of providing for itself comfortably through both times of economic boom or bust. A community where food and energy are produced locally, where waste is reduced and reclaimed for productive use. A community that values the unique contributions and skills of its citizens, where human development is a top priority and using less fossil fuels results in greater overall community well-being. We dare to dream of a Prince Rupert where imagination, creativity, fun and play unlock the collective genius within our community.
