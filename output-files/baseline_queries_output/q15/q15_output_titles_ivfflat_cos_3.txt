==Nick Clifford Simko==\\nI am a visual artist and museum enthusiast. For my studio work I am interested in visual culture of the past and its relevance to contemporary life. I use photography as a medium because of its capacity to relate to themes of transience, memory, and collecting. At the same time, photographs behave like paintings once did; vacillating between documents of reality and constructions of allegory and metaphor. The space between these two points of reference is where my work resides.

Windowzoo is one of the first community art projects worldwide.\\n\\nThe project turns everyone into an artist and every location into an exhibition space. Having found its origins in streetart, windowzoo has gone further and generated a new, non-destructive kind of urban landscape intervention.

The work installed might not be from the artist installing it and the photograph that makes it to the website might be from yet another person. The digital platform connects the installations across continents, time and space. Multiple layers of interaction combined with growing global appearance and disappearance”
