What is spatial opacity?\\n\\nSpatial opacity is a geographical term who leads with any type of obstacles who are found in space. Spatial opacity is everywhere an can have multiple characteristics, whether it is natural (hills, mountains, lakes, seas and so on) or not natural (traffic lights, intersections, doors and so on). Spatial opacity is everything that stops or interrupts any type of flows who are related to space.\\n\\n\\nMASDA \\n\\nCourses:\\n\\nThe main input from the courses is a very theoretical overview of the material. Depending on the subject, you may get some applied examples on how the theory matches real examples. \\nThe courses include a lot of training in statistics as well as approaches to spatial planning with computer support (GIS). All courses are presented with Powerpoint support and in the English language. \\nMany courses treat various policy issues on spatial planning of the European Union as well as political issues within the different EU Member States. In addition to that, there are some courses about sustainability in terms of spatial planning. \\nMost of the courses are related to the European Union and do not necessarily treat spatial planning of non-EU member States.
'''Virtual Surgery'''\\n\\nVirtual reality is a computer generated technology which allows information to be displayed in a simulated environment. Over the past decade virtual reality and computer simulation have expanded into other domains including the medical field.\\nVirtual reality is perhaps being used more in Medicine than in any other industry, because its applications have such far-reaching benefits. It promises to bring one of the most dramatic changes to the practice of medicine over the next decade.\\nIn Surgical training there is often a short fall in the number of desired operations performed. One consequence is that trainees may have less practice and feel less confident about many surgical procedures and techniques. With the increasing level of difficulty of surgical procedures it has become imperative that trainees have an arena in which to learn their trade that is forgiving. With the advent of Virtual reality, this has become a reality. \\nAt the present there are many applications of virtual reality in Medicine\\n•	Education - VR is used to create an environment for learning anatomy where exercises can be easily reversed.\\n•	Simulation for Surgical training -VR can teach surgeons new procedures and determine their level of competence before they operate on patients. It allows the trainee to practise a skill several times as a refresher course. \\n•	Project Hippocrates: VR is used to simulate, plan and execute Orthopaedic surgeries. The goal of this system is to allow the surgeons to simulate operations and then alter their approach to them based on the results of the simulated surgical procedure. The program allows the surgeon to plan his or her surgery.\\n•	Telemedicine: Telemedicine is a system of electronically communicating data from one site to a distant site for the purpose of medical diagnosis, patient care and as a medium for delivering medical services over long distances.
Individual differences psychology focuses on this second level of study. It is also sometimes called Differential Psychology because researchers in this area study the ways in which individual people differ in their behavior. This is distinguished from other aspects of psychology in that although psychology is ostensibly a study of individuals, modern psychologists often study groups or biological underpinnings of cognition.\\n\\nFor example, in evaluating the effectiveness of a new therapy, the mean performance of the therapy in one group might be compared to the mean effectiveness of a placebo (or a well-known therapy) in a second, control group. In this context, differences between individuals in their reaction to the experimental and control manipulations are actually treated as errors rather than as interesting phenomena to study.\\n\\nThis is because psychological research depends upon statistical controls that are only defined upon groups of people. Individual difference psychologists usually express their interest in individuals while studying groups by seeking dimensions shared by all individuals but upon which individuals differ.
Beware of food-borne diseases this summer\\nBy EDUARDO GONZALES, MD\\nMarch 30, 2009, 12:16pm\\nQ. Is it true that food-borne diseases are more common during summer? If so, why? Can you enumerate these diseases? How can we prevent them? -- Myrna M., Los Banos, Laguna \\n\\nA. Yes, the incidence of food-borne diseases peaks during summer. This is primarily because most food-borne pathogens (i.e., disease-causing microorganisms) grow fastest in warm and humid weather. Furthermore, people do more cooking and eating outdoors (i.e., picnics, barbecues, campings) during summer, which means they do without the safety facilities that their houses provide such as refrigeration and proper washing. \\n\\nThe list of diseases caused by pathogens or their toxins (poisons) that are transmitted through the intake of contaminated food and water is a long one. Most of these diseases affect the gastro-intestinal tract, but some affect other organs, too.  Food-borne pathogens include viruses such as the hepatitis A virus; bacteria such as those that cause food poisoning and various forms of gastroenteritis, cholera, typhoid fever and botulism; protozoa such as E. histolytica, the causative agent of amebiasis; and, other parasites such as ascaris, other roundworms and tapeworms.\\n\\nAny food item can be contaminated by pathogens and toxins. The contamination can occur during production, processing, distribution, preparation or storage of food. \\n\\nContamination of food with disease-causing agents can occur in the farm. For example, tapeworms which humans acquire when they eat raw or half-cooked meat find their way into pork or beef when cattle and pigs ingest the eggs of these worms while grazing. Another example, amoeba and the hepatitis A virus contaminate vegetables if plants are fertilized with night soil or watered with water from sewage canals (two common practices in the Philippines). \\n\\nFood processing plants that do not comply with standard health safety procedures are also occasional sources of pathogens in food products. But very often, food-borne illnesses are caused by improper handling and preparation of food at home.  \\n\\nFood-borne diseases, without exception, are preventable. Most can be prevented by simply observing the following measures:\\n\\n* Buy and consume only food (either raw or processed) that complies with safety standards.\\n* Cook food thoroughly. In particular, meat should not be eaten raw.\\n* Thoroughly wash with flowing water fruits and vegetables that are to be eaten raw.  This will not totally eliminate pathogens, but their number can be significantly reduced for the body’s other defenses to take care of.\\n* Wash food items for cooking before chopping or cutting.\\n* Wash with soap and water all utensils, chopping boards and kitchen areas before preparing meals.\\n* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing, eating and handling food.\\n* Eat cooked food within 1-2 hours after cooking. \\n* Refrigerate leftovers within 1-2 hours. \\n* Re-heat leftovers thoroughly before eating.\\n* Do not allow contact or mixing of raw and cooked foods.  \\n* Protect food from rodents, cockroaches, flies and other insects.\\n* Consume milk only if it has been pasteurized.\\n* Ensure that your drinking water is safe.\\n* When going for outings, keep perishable food like cooked meats, potato salads, etc. in an insulated cooler that is packed with ice. Do the same for raw meat, poultry and vegetables, but in a separate cooler.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that may develop two to three weeks after a Group A streptococcal infection (such as strep throat or scarlet fever). It is believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity and can involve the heart, joints, skin, and brain[1]. Acute rheumatic fever commonly appears in children between ages 5 and 15, with only 20% of first time attacks occurring in adults[1].\\n\\nIt gets its name for its similarity in presentation to rheumatism.[2]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Diagnosis\\n \\nRheumatic heart disease at autopsy with characteristic findings (thickened mitral valve, thickened chordae tendineae, hypertrophied left ventricular myocardium).Modified Jones criteria were first published in 1944 by T. Duckett Jones, MD.[3] They have been periodically revised by the American Heart Association in collaboration with other groups.[4] According to revised Jones criteria, the diagnosis of rheumatic fever can be made when two of the major criteria, or one major criterion plus two minor criteria, are present along with evidence of streptococcal infection. Exceptions are chorea and indolent carditis, each of which by itself can indicate rheumatic fever. [5][6][7]\\n\\n[edit] Major criteria\\nMigratory polyarthritis: a temporary migrating inflammation of the large joints, usually starting in the legs and migrating upwards. \\nCarditis: inflammation of the heart muscle which can manifest as congestive heart failure with shortness of breath, pericarditis with a rub, or a new heart murmur. \\nSubcutaneous nodules: painless, firm collections of collagen fibers over bones or tendons. They commonly appear on the back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees. \\nErythema marginatum: a long lasting rash that begins on the trunk or arms as macules and spreads outward to form a snake like ring while clearing in the middle. This rash never starts on the face and it is made worse with heat. \\nSydenham's chorea (St. Vitus' dance): a characteristic series of rapid movements without purpose of the face and arms. This can occur very late in the disease. \\n[edit] Minor criteria\\nFever \\nArthralgia: Joint pain without swelling \\nRaised Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C reactive protein \\nLeukocytosis \\nECG showing features of heart block, such as a prolonged PR interval[8] \\nSupporting evidence of Streptococcal infection: elevated or rising Antistreptolysin O titre or DNAase.[1]. \\nPrevious episode of rheumatic fever or inactive heart disease \\n[edit] Other signs and symptoms\\nAbdominal pain \\nNose bleeds \\n[edit] Pathophysiology\\nRheumatic fever is a systemic disease affecting the peri-arteriolar connective tissue and can occur after an untreated Group A Beta hemolytic streptococcal pharyngeal infection. It is believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity. This cross-reactivity is a Type II hypersensitivity reaction and is termed molecular mimicry. Usually, self reactive B cells remain anergic in the periphery without T cell co-stimulation. During a Strep. infection, mature antigen presenting cells such as B cells present the bacterial antigen to CD4-T cells which differentiate into helper T2 cells. Helper T2 cells subsequently activate the B cells to become plasma cells and induce the production of antibodies against the cell wall of Streptococcus. However the antibodies may also react against the myocardium and joints[9], producing the symptoms of rheumatic fever.\\n\\nGroup A streptococcus pyogenes has a cell wall composed of branched polymers which sometimes contain "M proteins" that are highly antigenic. The antibodies which the immune system generates against the "M proteins" may cross react with cardiac myofiber protein myosin[10],heart muscle glycogen and smooth muscle cells of arteries, inducing cytokine release and tissue destruction. However, the only proven cross reaction is with perivascular connective tissue.[citation needed] This inflammation occurs through direct attachment of complement and Fc receptor-mediated recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. Characteristic Aschoff bodies, composed of swollen eosinophilic collagen surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages can be seen on light microscopy. The larger macrophages may become Aschoff giant cells. Acute rheumatic valvular lesions may also involve a cell-mediated immunity reaction as these lesions predominantly contain T-helper cells and macrophages.[11]\\n\\nIn acute RF, these lesions can be found in any layer of the heart and is hence called pancarditis. The inflammation may cause a serofibrinous pericardial exudates described as “bread-and-butter” pericarditis, which usually resolves without sequelae. Involvement of the endocardium typically results in fibrinoid necrosis and verrucae formation along the lines of closure of the left-sided heart valves. Warty projections arise from the deposition, while subendothelial lesions may induce irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques.\\n\\nChronic rheumatic heart disease is characterized by repeated inflammation with fibrinous resolution. The cardinal anatomic changes of the valve include leaflet thickening, commissural fusion and shortening and thickening of the tendinous cords. [11]\\n\\n[edit] Treatment\\nThe management of acute rheumatic fever is geared toward the reduction of inflammation with anti-inflammatory medications such as aspirin or corticosteroids. Individuals with positive cultures for strep throat should also be treated with antibiotics. Aspirin is the drug of choice and should be given at high doses of 100 mg/kg/day. One should watch for side effects like gastritis, salicylate poisoning etc. Steroids are reserved for cases where there is evidence of involvement of heart. The use of steroids may prevent further scarring of tissue and may prevent development of sequelae such as Mitral stenosis. Monthly injections of Longacting Penicillin must be given for a period of 5 years in patients having one attack of Rheumatic fever. If there is evidence of carditis, the length of Penidure therapy may be up to 40 years. Another important cornerstone in treating rheumatic fever includes the continual use of low dose antibiotics (such as penicillin, sulfadiazine, or erythromycin) to prevent recurrence.\\n\\n[edit] Infection\\nPatients with positive cultures for Streptococcus pyogenes should be treated with penicillin as long as allergy is not present. This treatment will not alter the course of the acute disease.\\n\\n[edit] Inflammation\\nPatients with significant symptoms may require corticosteroids. Salicylates are useful for pain.\\n\\n[edit] Heart failure\\nSome patients develop significant carditis which manifests as congestive heart failure. This requires the usual treatment for heart failure: diuretics and digoxin. Unlike normal heart failure, rheumatic heart failure responds well to corticosteroids.\\n\\n[edit] Prevention\\nPrevention of recurrence is achieved by eradicating the acute infection and prophylaxis with antibiotics. The American Heart Association recommends daily or monthly prophylaxis continue long-term, perhaps for life.[12]\\n\\nScreening school-aged children for sore throats also aid in prevention.\\n\\n[edit] Epidemiology\\n \\nDisability-adjusted life year for rheumatic heart disease per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.[13] \\n     no data\\n \\n     less than 20\\n \\n     20-40\\n \\n     40-60\\n \\n     60-80\\n \\n     80-100\\n \\n     100-120\\n \\n     120-140\\n \\n     140-160\\n \\n     160-180\\n \\n     180-200\\n \\n     200-330\\n \\n     more than 330Rheumatic fever is common worldwide and responsible for many cases of damaged heart valves. In Western countries, it became fairly rare since the 1960s, probably due to widespread use of antibiotics to treat streptococcus infections. While it is far less common in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century, there have been a few outbreaks since the 1980s. Although the disease seldom occurs, it is serious and has a mortality of 2–5%.[14]\\n\\nRheumatic fever primarily affects children between ages 5 and 15 years and occurs approximately 20 days after strep throat or scarlet fever. In up to a third of cases, the underlying strep infection may not have caused any symptoms.\\n\\nThe rate of development of rheumatic fever in individuals with untreated strep infection is estimated to be 3%. The incidence of recurrence with a subsequent untreated infection is substantially greater (about 50%).[15] The rate of development is far lower in individuals who have received antibiotic treatment. Persons who have suffered a case of rheumatic fever have a tendency to develop flare-ups with repeated strep infections.\\n\\nThe recurrence of rheumatic fever is relatively common in the absence of maintenance of low dose antibiotics, especially during the first three to five years after the first episode. Heart complications may be long-term and severe, particularly if valves are involved.\\n\\nSurvivors of Rheumatic fever often have to take penicillin to prevent streptococcal infection which could possibly lead to another case of Rheumatic fever that could prove fatal.
'''The Problem of Global Warming'''\\n\\nWe face many environmental challenges that pose a risk to the well-being of life on earth. Many scientists would agree that at the forefront of these issues stands global warming. Global warming poses a multitude of problems that threaten us. Not only are the issues of global warming risks to our health, they are also potential dangers to the entire planet and every living creature that dwells on it. If we truly want to resolve global warming, we must establish a comprehensive strategy that addresses a way of preserving the world for the future.\\n\\n'''The effects of Global Warming and how Mankind Contributes to Our Problem'''\\n\\nBecause of our careless and reckless disregard for the Earth, some nasty effects of global warming are all too common. These include things like: diseases spreading, the potentially destructive melting of the polar ice caps which could result in the disastrous flooding of the Earth, and the diminishing of the protective layers of the atmosphere. It may also be connected with causing allergies to become more severe. According to an article in the August 17, 2000 edition of the New York Times, pollen levels may rise as carbon dioxide levels are increasing. This happens because the more carbon dioxide there is in the air, plant growth is accelerated. \\n\\n'''What We Can Do to Make a Positive Change'''\\n\\nAs an environmentalist who enjoys experiencing nature and capturing its beauty in photography, I am alarmed by the fact that the United States is contributing the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The appropriate plan to act on global warming is to treat Mother Earth with more consideration by driving less, controlling the population from reaching a level the world does not have the resources or space to sustain, and recycling and planting trees. If we were to collectively do this, we would do much to help with global warming. \\n\\n'''An Explanation of How These Environmentalist Ideas Would Help'''\\n\\nActing on these ideas I have presented would help in different but significant ways. If we were to walk to the store, instead of driving, we would be releasing less carbon fumes into the air, which would result in preserving the diminishing layers of the atmosphere. If we were to control the population from becoming even more crowded than it already is, we would not need to burn down our forests and destroy nature to make room for the incoming population. Recycling and planting trees promotes a healthy environment by allowing us to save valuable and fleeting resources, and by planting trees, we are letting plants release more oxygen into the atmosphere which makes a difference with global warming by balancing the levels of oxygen and carbon.\\n\\n'''Final Note'''\\n\\nIt is time to finally treat Mother Earth with the respect she deserves and truly needs for us to continue living on this planet. We’ve also victimized plants and animals by ruthlessly destroying their habitat, and by threatening species of animals and plants into extinction. Animals and plants have just as much right as humans to live hospitably in an environment where they can thrive, without humans ruining their terrain. My hope is to motivate even a few readers of the **** ****** to preserve the earth, and to speak out against people polluting Mother Earth. The sooner we realize this, the better off humanity will be.
The Mold problem and the human bio-toxin pathway\\n\\n\\nMolds are everywhere! \\nThey are the largest biomass on the planet and are constantly at work breaking down biodegradeables every minute of everyday. They are in the air we breath, indoors and outdoors, and are usually not causing problems with humans. \\n\\nThat is, until they invade our homes or place of business! \\nRemember,moisture follows gravity and molds follow moisture...EVERY TIME! When a moisture problem occurrs, such as a roofing leak, flood, or even when the air system is shut-off in a humid environment, molds will begin to grow and colonize almost anywhere on almost any organic material. They can even grow on plastic and metal and other materials normally concidered safe from fungal invasion when dirt or other organic build-up exists.\\n\\nWhen molds invade our indoor environments, the amount of airborne mold spores is amplified to a much more dangerous level than we are normally exposed to, which can cause severe health effects and reactions in humans. \\nThe majority of these health effects are caused by the toxins that molds create to protect their spores or "babies". These toxins are chemical compounds that are attached to the spores to protect them from their natural predators, like germs, insects and bacteria. \\n\\nWhen most of us breathe in airborne mold spores, our bodies can recognize the intruders and can normally produce anti-bodies to destroy them and remove them from the body. \\nBut nearly 25% of humans have been found to have an irregular HLA-DR gene, and this is the gene that controls the immune response system in the body. Normally one or two people will suffer far more health problems than the rest of the inhabitants, who normally feel that the others are "over-reacting or paranoid". Far from paranoid, these people recognize the effects the molds are having on their bodies, and the effects are often more serious than most people realize. \\n\\nBio-toxins can cause a mirriad of health effects in humans, ranging from headaches and allergy symptoms to asthma, resperatory infections and other serious long-term health issues. Some people will eventually develope "multiple-chemical-sensitivity", a term that many physicians are still unfamiliar with and have no knowledge of treatments.
'''Educational Technology'''\\n\\n\\nTechnology has a great impact in every aspect of our society, it changed how we communicate, entertain and learn.

They lack close friends due to the isolation they have adapted to. Some examples of what socially isolating yourself can mean are staying home, having no communication with anyone including friend and family, and basically avoiding any contact with other beings. If there is any social contact with another social species then it is most likely concise. Emotional or psychological challenges are the results of social isolation.  These results can cause symptoms of feeling depressed, distress, or anxious. This causes feelings of loneliness, fear of others, or negative self-esteem. \\n\\n\\nSocial isolation is common among early adulthood. Some cases of this isolation can get extreme. Clear boundaries are more characterized when the ego part of the personality is fully developing. This personality component that Sigmund Freud proposed is defined as a idea of a person's self physically and mentally. Independence gives a sense of disconnection from others. During this time of development, a person may become more preoccupied with feelings and thoughts of their individuality that are not easy to share with other individuals. This can be a result from feelings of shame, guilt, or alienation during childhood experiences.
{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\nThe debilitating effects of climate change seem to lead to medical impacts that affect a significant amount of people, particularly poor individuals and children.  With the gradual worsening of climate change, Asthma is a serious chronic illness that is currently on the rise.  Approximately 20 million Americans are inflicted with asthma.  According to the Environmental Defense Fund, more than “4,000 die every year from the disease, which also causes some 1.8 million emergency room visits” (EmergencyDefenseFundOnline).  Why, in recent years, has asthma symptoms become more prevalent?  Who is most vulnerable to its effects?  How does global climate change come into play?  \\n	Beginning with defining asthma and what it does to the body, the reader can better understand asthma as a chronic illness that “constricts airways and makes them swollen, filling with mucus. Your chest feels tight -- you may cough or wheeze -- and you just can't seem to catch your breath. In severe cases, asthma attacks can be deadly” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Furthermore, the Natural Resources Defense Council found that asthma kills approximately “5,000 people every year in America” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  It has been proven that people residing in poorer areas, with little sanitation, and both young children, and the elderly, are vulnerable subgroups to climate change and its effects on asthma.  \\n	Beginning with the world’s poorest populations, the Practical Action organization found that the world’s poorest people are the hardest hit by climate change due to devastating droughts, floods, and other weather events (PracticalActionOnline).  Furthermore, Practical Action proclaims that there is a massive injustice present since “climate change is caused by the world’s richest countries” (PracticalActionOnline).  Since poor countries lack the financial means and strong voice to rise up against rich countries’ plans, which may have a debilitating effect on the earth’s environment, and further leads to climate change and the influx of asthmatic symptoms, these poor nations bear the burden of climate change.  \\n	According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the persistence of certain diseases, such as asthma, depend largely on climate change (EPAOnline).  The extreme temperature changes that we have experienced cause a great loss of life, particularly on the elderly.  Additionally, the extreme high temperature changes can “increase air and water pollution, which in turn harm human health” (EPAOnline).  Furthermore, the EPA explains that “climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can indirectly impact the incidence of serious infectious diseases” (EPAOnline).  \\nIt is important to note that the “extent and nature of climate change impacts on human health vary by region, by relative vulnerability of population groups, by the extent and duration of exposure to climate change itself and by society’s ability to adapt to or cope with the change” (EPAOnline).  By being exposed to these extreme climate changes, people are more inclined to contract diseases, such as asthma.  Climate change is expected to contribute to some air quality problems.  \\n	 Respiratory disorders, such as asthma, are more prevalent as the climate changes in extreme manners.  The four main air pollutants that trigger asthma are as follows: Ground Level Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide, Particulate Matter, and Nitrogen Oxide.  Beginning with Ground Level Ozone, it is a “toxic component of smog…that is produced at ground level when tailpipe pollution from cars and trucks reacts with oxygen and sunlight” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Ground level ozone is most common in city-like environments.  People living in cities, which are known to be less sanitary than suburban areas, are predominantly poor and thus lack the means to move to areas with better air quality.  The cities are filled with buses and cars emitting harmful gases into the air and thus harming people in the near surroundings. \\n	Sulfur Dioxide is a “respiratory irritant…that is produced when coal and crude oil are burned” ( NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  As mentioned previously, cities are filled with objects emitting harmful gases into the air, and sulfur dioxide is quite prevalent in city-like living areas.  Sulfur Dioxide is emitted from coal-fired power plants.  Unfortunately, “one in five Americans lives within 10 miles of a coal-fired power plant” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  The fact that so many Americans live in such a close proximity of the coal-fired power plants goes to show that poor people do not have a great advantage at living in sufficient living conditions.\\n	Particulate matters are tiny particles in the air.  They come from a wide range of pollutants, such as dust, soot, and diesel exhaust particles (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  If these small particles are suspended from the air and into the lungs, then an asthma symptom can be triggered; thus affecting the asthmatic.  Approximately, “81 million people live in areas that fail to meet national air quality standards for particulate matter” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Coal-fired power plants and diesel vehicles are major emitters of particulate matter and thus further prove that people residing in poor living conditions are affected more than people living in more affluent areas.\\n	Finally, Nitrogen Oxide is a “gas emitted from tailpipes and power plants…it contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone and smog” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Furthermore, Nitrogen Oxide, when mixed with other air pollutants, form small particles that can trigger asthma.

These impacts arise not only from raw materials and component purchases, supplier manufacturing processes or logistics aarangements, but can also include final product disposal and even the siting of supplier plants. Given the strategic importance and the scale of organisational buying, a range of possibilities for environmental initiatives exist in the supply chain. These begin with the product, component or raw material to be purchased, where the buying company could stipulate minimum standards that the purchased product has to fulfil.\\nFor example, a paper-maker can insist the woodpulb in buys conforms to recognised standards of forest management rather than being made from clear-cutting an entire forest, or an electronic company can require its supplier to avoid certain harmful heavy metals in the supplied products. Other product based environmental initiatives can aim at by products of supplied input such as recycling packaging or reducing waste.
Why Donate Blood ?\\n\\nBlood is the living fluid that all life is based on.\\nBlood is composed of 60% liquid part and 40% solid part. The liquid part called Plasma, made up of 90% water and 10% nutrients, hormones, etc. is easily replenished by food, medicines, etc.\\nBut the solid part that contains RBC (red blood cells), WBC (white blood cells) and Platelets take valuable time to be replaced if lost.\\nThis is where you come in. The time taken by a patient's body to replace it could cost his/her life. Sometimes the body might not be in a condition to replace it at all.\\nAs you know blood cannot be harvested it can only be donated. This means only you can save a life that needs blood.\\nEvery year India requires 40 million units of 250cc blood out of which only a meager 500,000 of blood units are available. Saving a life does not require heroic deeds.\\nYou could just do it with a small thought and an even smaller effort by saying "yes".
 History is the study of the past, with special attention to the written record of the activities of human beings over time. Scholars who write about history are called historians. It is a field of research which uses a narrative to examine and analyse the sequence of events, and it often attempts to investigate objectively the patterns of cause and effect that determine events.[1][2] Historians debate the nature of history and the lessons history teaches.[1][3][4] A famous quote by George Santayana has it that "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."[5] The stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the legends surrounding King Arthur) are usually classified as cultural heritage rather than the "disinterested investigation" needed by the discipline of histna

== Environment ==\\n\\n''ENVIRONMENT''\\nThe Environment The impact of people on their environment can be devastating. This is where the respective role of governments can make decisions that shape environmental policy and responsibilities. These governments can be broken up into four different levels: local, state, federal and international. Air quality and biodiversity are two current issues that can be related to the role of governments. Global warming is also another implication that has a devastating effect on the environment. Current examples include the rise in sea levels, polar meltdowns, the melting of ice sheets and glaciers and human deaths due to disease from the effects of global warming. Firstly the environment can be defined as the natural features of our surroundings such as plant and animal life and their habitats, water, soils and the atmosphere. A local government named Rockdale Municipal Council has implemented certain actions to deal with the quality in that region. They have recognized that the main source of poor air quality originates from air pollution sources such as motor vehicles, industrial premises and aircraft emissions. The solutions to these problems include improvements to Ryde and Botany Bay cycle way, integration of land use and transport planning strategies, production of Air Quality - the Facts booklet for community, investigation of complaints regarding odours and dust, tree planting and preparation of a Local Air Quality Management Plan in 1999. Air quality is a major issue in most states within Australia that affects our greenhouse, to tackle the implications state governments have created policies and responsibilities. For instance Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) is a program that enables mainly state governments to take action on greenhouse. CCP provides these state governments with a strategic framework to diminish greenhouse gas emissions by helping them identify and recognize the emissions of their council and community, set a reduction goal and develop and utilize an action plan to reach that goal. State actions include: capturing the methane from landfill sites and public and non-car transport into urban planning. On a federal or national basis Australia has employed policies to increase the air quality. For example the Commonwealth Government will guarantee that Australia carries its fair-share of the burden in worldwide efforts to combat global air pollution through policy development and implementation. They have also supported the National Greenhouse Strategy (NGS) which began in late 1996. The government will also support the development of a national strategy to observe and manage air toxics. The air toxics strategy will monitor, establish the levels of community exposure to, and manage emissions of selected air toxics. The federal government will even consider the inclusion of air toxics in a future National Environmental Protection Measure. Further measures include the leading of the development of national ambient air quality standards through the National Environmental Protection Council and the assistance of the establishment of a National Pollutant Inventory which will require large companies to publicly report their emission of 90 pollutants. Local government Rockdale Municipal Council has introduced responsibilities and policies to reduce the loss of biodiversity. This local government has learned that the cause involves the introduction of species, pollution of land and water, weed invasion and urban encroachment. Their solutions to these problems comprise of the planting of over 3,500 plants and shrubs in Bardwell Valley and Scotts Reserve, bush regeneration and planting in Scarborough Reserve, involvement in Cooks River Foreshores Working Party and preparation of a flora and fauna study in 2000. Policies towards the community include controlling noxious weeds on your property, planting native trees indigenous to the area and applying to the council prior to removing any trees. The Labor Tasmanian Government has created a new Environment Policy on biodiversity that hopes to preserve native plants and animals. The policies commit the government to encourage community involvement in biological diversity programs, proclaim the Tasman National Park, establish a State Biodiversity Committee with community representation to arrange a Tasmanian Biodiversity Strategy, support the development of a State Policy on the protection of remnant native vegetation, examine the possibility of incorporating the Biodiversity Strategy into legislation and seeking the co-operation of local government and the community in including and enforcing biological diversity guidelines in development criteria. The federal government has enabled several policies to deal with conservation of Australia's biodiversity. The government will support the National Reserve System program to expand Australia's National Parks, support off-reserve biodiversity conservation including the planting of trees and the protection of vegetation through the Bushcare program and work with the States to reduce unsustainable land clearing, develop an alert list of introduced plants and animals that pose a risk to our environment. The government will also maintain a ban on the export of live fauna; support research into Australia's floral and fauna assemblages as well as biodiversity conservation methods and ratify the Desertification Convention. An international conference held in Kyoto, Japan in December 1997 discussed issues on how best to reduce global warming. Kyoto Protocol negotiations have reached a legally binding agreement limiting the amount of gas emissions all industrialized countries. The protocol also included provisions for emission trading between industrialized countries. The overall nominal effect of the Kyoto protocol is for a reduction of 5.2% of emissions by 2010. However the agreement has many flaws and could lead to emission rising above 1990 levels. The protocol specifies that Japan must reduce emissions by 6%, USA by 7% and the European Union by 8%. The chairman of the conference negotiators, Raul Estrada said that further discussions were needed to find a way of implementing a system of trading in emissions. Trading allows countries that produce high levels of greenhouse gases, such as the USA,to buy the right to retain or even increase emissions. 15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)~~\\nGlobal warming refers to an expected rise in global average temperature due to the continued emission of greenhouse gases produced by industry and agriculture which trap heat in the atmosphere. Higher temperatures are expected to be accompanied by changing patterns of precipitation frequency and intensity, changes in soil moisture and a rise of the global sea level. To assess current examples relating to global warming, an examination is first needed on these examples. Sea levels could rise six feet and up in future centuries. The entire Amazon rainforest will be lost if the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases by more than 50%. But no matter whatever action the world takes to stop global warming, sea levels are set to rise and wipe out several island nations. The worst news is that whatever governments do to cut emissions, sea levels will rise by at least 2 metres over the next few hundred years, devastating Tuvalu and Kiribati in the Pacific and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean. Low-lying farmland and cities occupied by hundreds of millions of people will also be engulfed. Robert Nicholls of Middlesex University in London stated that thermal expansion of the ocean will continue for many hundreds of years after CO2 is stabilized, due to the gradual penetration of heat deeper and deeper into the ocean. All around the world ice sheets and glaciers are melting at a rate quite remarkably since record keeping began. A worldwide institute, based in Washington DC says that glaciers and other features are particularly sensitive to temperature shifts, and that scientists suspect the enhanced melting is among the first observable signs of human induced global warming. Some of the effects of global warming are as follows: arctic ocean sea ice shrunk by 6% since 1978, with a 14% loss of thicker year round ice, Greenland ice sheet has thinned by more than a metre a year on its southern and eastern edges since 1993 and 22% of glacial ice volume on the Tien Shan mountains has disappeared in the last 40 years. Worldwatch declared that the Earth's ice cover reflects much of the sun's heat back into space and the loss of much of it would affect the global, raise sea levels, and threaten water supplies. They also stated that the land and water left revealed by the retaining ice would themselves retain heat, creating a feedback loop that would speed up the warming process. The institute pronounced that the world's glaciers, taken as a whole, are now shrinking faster than they are growing. Worldwatch also warns of the outcomes of retaining ice on wildlife. In northern Canada reports of hunger and weight loss among polar bears have been associated with ice cover changes. And in Antarctica, sea loss, rising air temperatures and increased condensation are altering the habitats and the feeding and breeding patterns of seals and penguins. Cornell University ecologists believe that global warming may account for millions of human deaths from disease. David Pimentel a professor of ecology at Cornell stated and assumes that Most of the increase in disease is due to numerous environmental factors, including infectious microbes, pollution by chemicals and biological wastes and shortages of food and nutrients. Global warming will only make matters worse. Global warming will produce a favorable climate for disease producing organisms and plant pests. Global climate change will result in a net loss of obtainable food, for example the decline in rainfall (due to global warming) causes crop and plant production to die out. Infectious disease and environmental factors are to blame for more than 75% of all deaths in the world. Environmental disease may comprise of organic and chemical pollutants, including smoke from tabacco and wood sources. More than three billion people are malnourished. Malnutrition increases vulnerability to pollution-related illnesses and diseases such as diarrhea. Therefore Pimental concluded, we're seeing the first signs that global climate change can influence the incidences of human disease. And that this change combined with population growth and environmental degradation, will probably intensify world malnutrition and increases in other diseases as well. Melting is taking on vast and unprecedented level in the Arctic sea ice, the Antarctic and in dozens of mountain and sub-polar glaciers, and the rate has accelerated immensely in the past decade. The Earth's ice cover could have intense changes on the global climate and rising sea levels could start regional flooding. Melting of mountain glaciers could also endanger urban water supplies and the habitats of plant and animal species in fragile environments. Within the next 35 years, the Himalayan glacial area is expected to shrink by one-fifth, to just 100, 000 kilometres. A prediction forecasts that the remaining glaciers could disappear in 30 years. The melting has been especially noticeable in the past three decades, and scientists believe that it is the result of human behaviour and the build up of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. All current examples of global warming are significant due to the effects that it has on the environment and people. For people, it can cause infectious diseases and pollution-related illnesses that in turn effect our standard of living. Some examples can be more significant than others. For example diseases amongst people is more so important than the rise in sea levels and melting of glaciers since peoples existence are endangered\\n\\n		\\n		\\n		\\nIn Your Home – Conserve Energy \\n1.

Its effects and causes have been on the rise and people need to do something about it before the problem gets any worse. Global warming is an increase in the earth's temperature, which can be caused by the use of fossil fuels, and industrial or agricultural processes. Man-made emissions are adding to the amount of carbon dioxide already being naturally released. These harmful processes have been leading to a large increase in the buildup of "greenhouse gases," which are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. Up until the industrial revolution the world did not have such a terrifying problem of dealing with the buildup of harmful gases in the atmosphere but now with the increasing population growth, increased fossil fuel burning, and.....

Silver was probably one of the first metals smelted from ore. Silver goes back to the times of the ancient Byzantine, Phoenician and Egyptian empires. Other than jewelry, silver has been forged into domestic utensils, buttons, boxes and other articles. Other than liquid mercury, silver is the brightest reflector among metals. This allows it to be polished to sheen. The Latin word for silver is Ag - Argentum that stands for 'white and shining'.\\n\\nAncient silver jewelry was handed down the generations among North and South American natives. Silver is extensively mined in the ores of Mexico and Peru. The comparatively low price of silver makes it a popular metal for jewelry, especially for fine and innovative designs. Silver jewelry craftsmen experiment with silver and later duplicate their patterns with gold.\\n\\nSilver jewelry is popular with women who want to achieve a less-formal look. Silver jewelry is popularly gifted to women and children. Even men can be gifted silver cuff links, tiepins or signet rings. It is representative of a tender emotion or a lovely memory. Sterling silver jewelry carries a stamp of sophistication without being over the top. Find out how to care for your silver jewelry.
Lesotho is one of the poorest countries in the world and is classified as a Least Developed Country. The apparel industry is the largest employer in Lesotho. It has been built on the preferential trade opportunities created by the US Growth & Opportunity Act (AGOA) and is working on moving up the value chain to create a niche market as an ethical sourcing destination.\\n    The Apparel Lesotho Alliance to Fight AIDS (ALAFA) is an industry-wide programme providing prevention and treatment for the 46000 mainly women workers in the industry. This is helping to combat two of the key drivers of the HIV/AIDS edpidemic: poverty and gender inequality. Surveys within the industry show that 43% of employees are HIV-postive.\\n    The creation of ALAFA was driven by humanitarian concerns and the need to make the industry sustainable in the long term. It was launched in May 2006 in Maseru.\\n    ALAFA is a direct beneficiary of the ONE T-shirt campaign by the Campaign to Make Poverty History and receives a donation from every T-shirt sold.
== Herpes ==\\nHerpes is a viral infection disease causing small painful blisters and inflammation, most commonly at the junction of skin and mucous membrane in the mouth or nose or in the genitals areas. It is more common in women than in men possibly because male to female transmission is more efficient than female to male transmission. Oral herpes causes cold sores around the mouth or face. Genital herpes affects the genitals, buttocks or anal area. The virus can spread even when sores are not present. Mothers can also infect their babies during childbirth. Some people have no symptoms. Others get sores near the area where the virus has entered the body. They turn into blisters, become itchy and painful, and then heal. The virus can be dangerous in newborn babies or in people with weak immune systems. \\n           Most people have outbreaks several times a year. Over time, you get them less often. Medicines to help your body fight the virus can help lessen symptoms and decrease outbreaks. Correct usage of latex condoms can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading herpes. Most people get Herpes Simplex Virus type - 1 infections, which cause cold sores, during infancy or childhood. They usually get it from close contact with family members or friends who carry the virus. It can be transmitted by kissing, sharing eating utensils, or by sharing towels. The sores most commonly affect the lips, mouth, nose, chin, or cheeks and occur shortly after exposure. Patients may barely notice any symptoms or find these sores annoying and seek medical attention. Most people get Herpes Simplex Virus type - 2 infections, which cause genital sores, following sexual contact with an infected person. The virus affects anywhere between five and twenty million people, up to 20% of all sexually active adults in the United States.\\nThe lesions of both types of herpes simplex can be spread by touching an unaffected part of the body immediately after touching a herpes lesion.

\\nLove is an emotion of a strong affection and personal attachment.[1] Love is also a virtue representing all of human kindness, compassion, and affection; and "the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another".[2] Love may also be described as actions towards others or oneself based on compassion, or as actions towards others based on affection.[3] In English, love refers to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from pleasure ("I loved that meal") to interpersonal attraction ("I love my partner"). "Love" may refer specifically to the passionate desire and intimacy of romantic love, to the sexual love of eros, to the emotional closeness of familial love, to the platonic love that defines friendship,[4] or to the profound oneness or devotion of religious love.[5] This diversity of uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states. Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts.[6] Love may be understood as part of the survival instinct, a function to keep human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.
'''Introduction:'''\\n\\nFlood is a common phenomenon in Bangladesh. Flood related crises have a gender dimension and affect women, the silent gender, more than men, who have the least capacity to deal with the situation for a variety of cultural, economical, historical, political and social reasons. Floods hit women harder, not just because they are physically weaker, but because of their reproductive capacity, physical responsibility for children and vulnerable socio-economic status. The patriarchal social structure and norms, gendered economics and gendered culture of Bangladesh, underpinned by religious traditions restrict the mobility of women during floods. Wider household responsibilities of women like food processing and cooking, cleaning, collecting water and fuel, bearing and rearing children looking after livestock and income generation also become much more difficult to perform under flood conditions. This article is attempted to highlight how women become more vulnerable by their social status, both during and after the full impact of floods and also the strategies adopted by flood victim women, which are crucial for the household survival.\\n\\n\\n'''Flood and its causes:'''\\n\\nThe origins of floods in Bangladesh are diverse. Floodwater may come from three main sources:\\n\\n	Rivers\\n	Rainfall\\n	Sea\\n\\nThree together or independently, may all generate more water that can’t be drained quickly from the land. However, the specific causes of floods vary from region to region. Several explanations have been addressed here:\\n\\n	Confluence of the major rivers\\n	High monsoon rainfall\\n	Rise of sea level\\n	Siltation of rivers\\n	Flood control measures\\n	Deforestation\\n	Construction of Farakka barrage and others\\n\\nThe last three causes, flood control measures, deforestation and the construction of Farakka barrage, are not only due to natural environmental factors but also to social factors.\\n\\n'''Flood control measures and women:'''\\n\\nIn Bangladesh embankments have been used as a traditional flood control measure since long time. However, a number of studies and reports have pointed out the negative consequences of Flood Control and Drainage (FCD) and Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation (FCDI) projects: the benefits of these projects were not planned. Because such projects are often not based on the nature of the flood plain, they do not prevent flood but rather increase flood losses. Many embankments have had a negative effect on river regimes, land formation, agriculture and fisheries and on the overall environment. Researchers have pointed out that any step to control flooding should emphasize both the structural and non-structural methods. They have discussed the problems of floods and the negative consequences upon the environment, farmers (men), and fisheries and on many other aspects of life in Bangladesh. However, they have ignored the problems of women. There has been almost no discussion of the differential impact of flooding upon men and women and very little about its impact upon people in different socio-economic categories. Policy makers, however, have only recently started to think about the way in which women might be involved in different activities from men and have different experiences of flooding from men, They have agreed that women’s activities should be ‘visible’ in the development sector and therefore, should be integrated with development activities in the water sector (The Fourth Five Year Plan, 1995). There are only a few studies (e. g. Adnan, 1990; Hanchett, 1992) which briefly consider the situation of women during floods. FAP 14’s gender study was based on a few case studies of female-headed households and was not compared with men’s response.\\n\\n'''Problems faced by women during floods:'''\\n\\nDuring floods women face different types of problems. For example:\\n\\n	Women suffer from lack of food, clothing and shelter during floods. Owing to their lack of resources, poor women face greater problems than women in middle and rich households. They suffer from shortages of food and other essentials, resulting in increasing prices and a consequent decline in purchasing power. They often have to eat unusual food and adjust consumption patterns of this.\\n\\n	Unemployed men often sit idle or move elsewhere leaving their household members behind during floods. It is women, the household-based workers, who have to take responsibility for protecting their houses, children and other members of the family, livestock and belongings.\\n\\n	Traditional gender specific work, such as carrying water, cooking, caring for children and animals become too difficult for women during flood conditions. Especially gender-assigned tasks like procuring food and providing drinking water, storing fuel and child care are such that women have to bear more physical burden of coping than men do. \\n\\n	Women’s assets such milch cows, poultry, trees, kitchen and utensils are particularly vulnerable to flood.\\n\\n	Domestic violence also increases during floods. Husbands beat their wives and children when food-supply run out in flood-stricken households.\\n\\n	Many women often become unwilling to go to flood shelters because of the Muslim culture ‘purdah’ which means that women should not show themselves to unrelated men.\\n\\n	During floods poor widow women confine to their houses for many days and have to drink flood water as they have neither the physical strength to reach tube wells, nor the economic means to hire a boat to collect clean water.\\n\\n	Bangladeshi women wear long 'Shari', which hinders their movement from one place to another during floods. It often entangles in fixed debris and limits the speed of evacuation. Again, poor women with only one Shari are often oblige to remain in wet cloth for most of the days for the lack of private space and to dry off.\\n\\n	Victim women often don’t have cloths to come out to take relief. Again, many women lose their breast-feeding infants in flood and suffer from puffed breast pain. There also happen cases of miscarriage which don’t get proper medication during floods. Pregnant and lactating women suffer from malnutrition i.e. lack of vitamin A, iodine and iron deficiencies, which result in eye diseases, night blindness, anemia, goiter etc.\\n\\n	In flood shelters women face several problems, which are related to their gender identity. For example, it becomes impossible for women to disregard their inhibition and go to latrines, which are open to all. They often have to wait till dark/night to ensure privacy to response the calls by nature, even changing the clothes/sanitary pad with menstrual blood.\\n\\n	While distributing relief in shelters, women are often pushed down and left behind in the rush by men. Again, child care, illness and conservatism keep many women away from taking relief goods. Women also give part of their food ration to their children consequently denying themselves the opportunity to maintain their strength and support their families.\\n\\n	Women who are in their own for whatever reason, whether they are single, widowed, abandoned, unaccompanied, lone heads of households or who have been separated from male family members by the chaos of the flood situations, often become victim of sexual violence in flood shelters.\\n\\n	Women are further vulnerable to the secondary impacts of floods due to socio-cultural and economic factors. When resources such as temporary shelter, fresh water, food and medicines are distributed, women are again marginalized. For example, in many cases women are unable to make decisions about whether loans should be secured to rebuild homes or to purchase crop seeds or other means to generate an income such as the purchase of a boat for transporting goods.        \\n\\n'''Coping mechanisms of women during floods:'''\\n\\nFloods affect both women and men but the burden of coping with flood falls heavily on women. The tasks women perform before, during and after floods, the problems they face and the coping mechanisms they adopt are related to women’s gender identity. Women in poorer categories often act as men do in making platforms, cutting bamboo, making bamboo bridges protecting crops and livestock and engaging in income generating activities. On the other hand, men usually remain more restricted to their gender-assigned activities. Some of the coping mechanisms of women have been highlighted here.\\n'''\\nWomen and water collection:'''\\n\\nThe collection of water during floods causes great problems for women. Women are usually responsible for collecting and storing water. During floods tube-wells, the most common source of pure drinking water in Bangladesh, go under water and poor women have to take considerable risks to procure drinking water from great distances. They have to walk through chest-high water or swim to collect fresh or clean water. Again, they have not enough fuel to boil water or fitciri to purify it with alum. However, they help each other to get pure drinking water from different sources.\\n\\n'''Sale of women’s assets:'''\\n\\nThe sale of assets is a common way for rural households to survive any crisis. Non-productive assets like milking cows or goats, jewellery or household items cannot usually produce a continuous income as land or cattle but they can easily be converted to cash and are therefore the first to be disposed off to meet the immediate needs of family survival. These assets usually belong to women, and they are often their only assets. They are sold, or mortgaged by their husbands to repay loans, to educate sons or to maintain the livelihood of the households. Both women and men resist changing their status from farmer to landless as long as they have other options to cope with crisis. Most women don’t have own valuable assets as men do. Even if they have some assets they are considered ‘less valuable’ or ‘non-productive’. However, women’s ‘non-productive’ assets become more ‘productive’ when they are disposed off during floods. Women’s assets are used to meet the immediate needs of the households during floods when men’s assets are kept for the future. \\n\\n'''Women and food preparation:'''\\n\\nDuring floods there is a great difference in the kind of food, the amount and the frequency of food preparation and the sources of food among women in different socio-economic categories. The food supplies of the poor, undernourished and malnourished at the best of times, are further reduced during the floods and it is women who have the responsibility for adjusting the household food consumption. Women’s work is closely related with agricultural production, family food and income generation and that is why the burden of food shortage falls upon them.\\n\\nMost of the poor households don’t have a reliable and stable source of food during floods. Women in these categories play a vital role in acquiring food from many sources, some of which are totally different from flood-free sources. When there is a shortage they try to manage food through their own efforts by gathering edible or wild plants and small amounts of low quality food such as rotten or discarded vegetables or accepting rice gruel from better-off women. Destitute and landless women maintain their livelihood by a hand-to-mouth existence. During floods the normal pattern of food consumption in the household changes. The price of staple food items becomes so high that it goes beyond the purchasing power of the poor. So, they often cook khesari or kalai dal (kind of inferior pulse), mania or cheer paddy, which they consider to be animal food, curry with fen (rice gruel) and chhatu (flour normally made of barley or chickpea or maize), kura (the red powdery coating of rice under the husk), lumps of flour burnt in the fire, one handful of rice with lots of water and chili, fried broken bits of grain and different aquatic plants. It is also evident that both women and men in poorer categories suffer from food shortages and women commonly sacrifice their own meals for their husbands and children.\\n\\n''' \\nWomen and common village resources:'''\\nDuring floods women become undernourished subsisting on a lean diet of vegetables, creepers and herbs. Their dependence on food from the common land increases greatly. When men fail to earn any money, they become helpless and do not feel it incumbent upon them to find alternative source of food for their families. Women, on the other hand, are much more capable than men of collecting food for families. They usually collect variety of food items from village common land like Shapla (the stem of the water lily) which women use as a major food item and is often mixed with others like kolmi shak (arum leaves) or kochumukhi (wild arum). \\n\\n'''Women and family health care:'''\\n\\nThere are some general flood-diseases, such as, diarrhea, viral fever, jaundice, skin diseases, conjunctivitis and swelling of limbs. It is evident that without any healthcare facilities from government or other organizations during floods, it is women who provide health care for the sick. Only women have knowledge about certain medicinal trees and they use herbs, roots and barks to cure family members from different types of diseases. Poorer women take risks to collect medicinal herbs from distant places during the floods despite purda restrictions. Men, on the other hand, rarely do such work because providing herbal treatment or nursing is not their gender-assigned role. Men in poorer categories also do not have the resources to get modern treatment. However, most women in the poorer categories, despite their own sickness and other activities, try their best to cure sick family members themselves in order to avoid the cost of modern treatment.\\n\\n'''Women and social network:'''\\n\\nWith little or no support from the government during floods, the women of poor households sick help from their social networks. Such support mainly comes from their own and that of their husbands’ kin and sometimes from patrons and neighbors. Women are able to get more support from such relationships than men. Relatives and neighbors provide shelter, lend food, supply loans with little or no interest, provide temporary employment and help with money, labor or materials to rebuild houses after floods. Men, on the other hand, do not show such ability to provide for their households. Borrowing small things or food is not a man’s responsibility and asking for help is often considered below their dignity.\\n\\n'''Recommendations:'''\\n\\nDuring floods where people as a whole are vulnerable, women are more vulnerable as they bear the burden of managing the survival of the household. Therefore, special attention should be given on after-flood rehabilitation program for women. For example:\\n\\n	There should be more female volunteers. In the case of major floods, male volunteers can not adequately meet women’s needs. \\n\\n	Women relief workers face higher security risks and obstructive ness from local male leaders and government officials when trying to carry out their work. More women volunteers should be available to form a strong group, able to overcome these problems collectively.\\n\\n	Female doctors and nurses should be included in the volunteer team, alongside a male medical team. Emergency medicine and equipment should be available to cope with women’s needs. For example, many women lost their breast-feeding infants during floods. Pumps to express breast milk must be available, in order to avoid serious infection and debilitating pain. Equipment and medication is needed to handle the inevitable miscarriages. \\n\\n	Poor women generally know fewer languages. So, local volunteers are needed to overcome language problems, in order to get access to the women more easily and to understand their specific needs.\\n\\n	During relief distribution women should be given first priority, and a separate distribution line needs to be organized for them as they have the additional responsibility for children.\\n\\n	In particularly conservative areas women may need house-to-house distribution as they face social obstacles to come to the distribution line to compete in the struggle for food supplies, elbowing and pushing, with men.\\n\\n\\n	As women must be fully clothed to go out to get food, clothing is an essential part of emergency relief.\\n     \\n'''Conclusion:'''\\n\\nThe inclusion of gender perspective in the study of flood is very pertinent and justified considering the context of Bangladesh. During floods where people as a whole are vulnerable, women become more vulnerable who bear the burden of managing the survival of household under crisis. Therefore, for effective flood management programs to be conceived and implemented successfully, gender specific awareness must be fully realized and accounted for. Since many women become disoriented and threatened by the loss of their homes, flood management policies need to be sensitive and aware of the meaning and significance of home and the implications for dealing with female flood victims. To reduce the vulnerability of women during floods specific programs should be devised and implemented that raise the awareness of women to the risks they face and also the range of adjustments that they can make. Such programs also need to be culturally and socially sensitive. Because of women’s significant contributions to their households’ survival during floods, their activities need to receive attention in government planning. \\n\\n \\n'''Bibliography:''' \\n\\nAhsan, Rosie Majid and Khatun.

Author: Eastine Charles Taneo\\n\\nDate published: March 10, 2012\\n\\n                       Deforestation has important implications for life on this planet. The transformation of forested lands by human actions represents one of the great forces in global environmental change and one of the great drivers of biodiversity loss. The impact of people has been and continues to be profound. Forests are cleared, degraded and fragmented by timber harvest, conversion to agriculture, road-building, fire, and in other ways. The effort to use and subdue the forest has been a constant theme in the transformation of the earth, in many societies, in many lands, and at most times. \\n\\n                       Forests are habitats and shelters to millions of species, reduce flooding, soil conserver, provide products for human use and consumption, give valuable ecosystem services.  They are home to more than half of all species living on land.  They also play several roles in the flooding because trees hold and use more water than farms or grasslands. With enough water, the river must rise above its banks and flood. The faster water runs from the watershed into the river, the higher a flood will be. Tree roots hold the soil in place, reducing the movement of sediment that can shrink river channels downstream and it can prevent soil erosion. Forests provide useful wood products.  Roundwood can be processed into building materials, or made into plywood products, furniture, etc. \\n\\n                       The following are factors of deforestation: logging, fires, urban construction, agriculture and commercial purposes.\\n\\n \\n\\n                     The first factor of deforestation is logging. Logging, both legal and illegal, is the cutting, skidding of trees in the forest. It is one of the major causes of deforestation in the world today. Trees that are cut-down are usually used by humans to trade. The logs are then generally transported to a saw mill to be cut into timber, a paper mill for paper pulp, of for other purposes like fence posts (Glastra, 1999). Logging is also tagged to the term “clearcutting”. It is a harvest method that removes essentially all the standing trees in a selected area (Glastra, 1999). A “clearcut” may or may not have reserve trees left to attain goals other than regeneration.\\n\\n                        There are different logging methods applied and some of these are “tree-length logging”, “full-tree logging”, and “cut-to-length logging”. Tree-length logging is a mechanized form of logging that involves felling and topping trees at the stump inside the cutblock or by the roadside (Wiki, 2009). The felled trees are then transported to the roadside or a landing site for hauling to a mill. Full-tree length is defined as trees are felled and transported to roadside with branches and top intact (Pulkki, no date). Transporting trees to the roadside is mainly by cable or grapple skidders. Cut-to-length method is trees are cut-off above the stump with stump height less than one-half butt diameter and bucked to various assortments directly in the stump area.\\n\\n                       The second factor of deforestation is fire. Forest fire is often used to signify an uncontrolled intense fire that breaks out in the wooded areas, grasslands, bushes, scrublands and peats due to many factors ranging from natural to man-made causes. It can easily spread to a vast area. It can also change its direction and overcome barriers like rivers and roads. Some of the causes of forest fires are natural such as lightning, and human activities and negligence like camp fire, lighted cigarettes (Bora, 2011) and kaingin system. Natural causes like lightning burns the trees and fire easily spread into the area.  About 14% of forest fires are due to lightning strikes (Dunn, 2009). Human activities and negligence are about 86% of forest fires (Dunn, 2009). Tourists or smokers sometimes leave camp fires or drop lighted items like cigarettes and matches in the forests which can easily set nearby bushes on fire and further develops into huge forest fire. On the other hand, kaingin or “slash-and-burn farming” system is an agricultural technique which involves intentional cutting and burning of trees in the forests to create fields. It includes a diverse collection of farming systems from long fallow shifting cultivation to short fallow shifting cultivation to forest pioneer farming. Unlike traditional farming methods that were used in harmony with the forests recuperative capacity, current slash-and-burn farming depletes the very soil resource upon which all agriculture and forestry depend. One of the strong commonalities of all slash-and-burn farmers is that they are among the poorest, most marginalized groups of their societies and have little or no influence on the important land use policy decisions made in their countries.\\n\\n                       The third cause of deforestation is urban construction. Forests are the way for residential houses, building and factories. Roads are building for trading and easier transports. This has made possible the needs of the social groups in the society. The cutting down of trees for lumber that is used for building materials, furniture, and paper products have a major impact on forest life. Forests are cleared to accommodate expanding urban areas.\\n\\n                       The fourth cause of deforestation is converting the forest to agricultural land. Trees in the forests are cut down to clear land for growing crops, build farms, ranches and other food growing lands. The economic consequences of deforestation and the process of becoming peasants are devastating. In contrast to the rich variety of foods the forest people are accustomed to plowing fields and peasants specialize in just four crops: rice, corn, tomatoes, and onions (Schelgel, 1999).  Hunting and fishing and gathering played almost no role at all in the cleared regions. The forests are gone and the rivers and creeks are seriously depleted. Commercial agriculture's role in deforestation is two-fold. First, agribusiness can indirectly result in deforestation. Commercial farms occupy the best and most fertile agricultural soils located in the valleys. This land is not available to the growing rural population that depends on agriculture for their subsistence. Without access to farmland in their immediate area, farming families have had to relocate to less fertile and less productive forested land. Second, agribusiness can be a direct cause of deforestation. Through a concession agreement, land purchase, or an informal land occupation; companies take possession of forested land with the intention of converting it to another use.\\n\\n                       The fifth cause is cattle ranching and livestock grazing. A cattle ranching is a major cause of deforestation. Ranchers occupy large tracts of forests and clear the land themselves or they buy the improvements made by small farmers. Traditionally, ranchers favored the more easily managed range and pasture lands of the dry forest zones, but for the last four decades there has been intensive clearing of the forests. Open-range grazing as is practiced in the dry woodlands can be a major contributor to deforestation when herd populations exceed the carrying capacity of the range. It can also seriously degrade the composition and quality of the forest when practiced too intensively.\\n                       The sixth cause of deforestation is mining and oil exploration that are locally important to deforestation. Large mines consumed vast quantities of indigenous woodlands to supply fuel to their smelting operations before plantations of fast-growing species were established (Lovekar, 2011). Oil exploration activities, such as the clearing of the seismic lines in the forests not only destroy the forests but also open them up to colonization by subsistence farmers who follow the exploration crews. The impact of gold mining has been widely publicized but its negative impacts have affected the indigenous peoples and the quality of the water more than the adjacent forests.\\n\\n                       The effects of deforestation may include loss of topsoil, disruption of the water cycle, loss of biodiversity, loss of potential discoveries, flooding and drought and climate change.\\n\\n                      First effect of deforestation is the loss of topsoil. Deforestation results in rapid degradation of nutrient rich topsoil. Heavy rainfall and high sunlight quickly damage the topsoil in clearings of forests. When these forests are cut-and-burnt, nutrients are released in the form of ash (Schlegel, 1999). This allows for a year or two of good crop on the newly cleared virgin land but eventually the nutrients will be washed away by the heavy tropical rain.\\n\\n                       Second effect of deforestation is the disruption of the water cycle. In the water cycle there are only a few processes that give water back to the atmosphere, such as transpiration, expiration and evaporation. Transpiration is the process by which water is loss from plants to the atmosphere (Starr, 2006). So, if plants are removed, especially at a high rate such as deforestation, there will be less water returning in the atmosphere. This will eventually cause a reduction in the amount of water returning the earth's surface such as the seas, lakes, rivers etc.\\n\\n                       Third effect is the loss of biodiversity. Biodiversity is the sum of all species occupying a specified area during a specified interval, past as well as present (Starr, 2006). Deforestation affects biological diversity by the destruction of natural habitats, which forces species out of their native areas. Isolation and fragmentation restrict their range, forcing them into unnatural and restrictive habitats, which may lead to their extinction. Temperature changes caused by loss of the protective canopy of the forest also contribute to this. Deforestation through clear-cutting creates a patched look to the landscape. Not only is this unpleasant to the eye, but it is terrible to the local wildlife. For other species, fragmented landscapes become population sinks that are sustained by immigration from nearby forest tracts (Schlegel, 1999). \\n\\n                       The fourth effect is the loss of potential discoveries. There is the possibility that the basic elements of potential medical treatments, cures and vaccines may lie undiscovered within these environments. The key active ingredient in one-fourth of the world’s prescription and non-prescription drugs come from plants growing in tropical rain forests. Fewer trees translate into an insecure future for forest workers. Some indigenous peoples’ way of life and survival are threatened by the loss of forests. Often, the stakeholders associated with forest areas are not always consulted before clearcutting occurs. This has sometimes lead to non-violent and violent confrontation and fueled bitter rivalries between area residents, the forest sector and environmentalists.\\n\\n                        The fifth effect is flooding and drought. One of the functions of forests is to absorb and store great amounts of water quickly when there are heavy rains. When the trees are cut down, it will not regulate or hold the flow of the water which leads to flooding and alters to drought. Deforestation causes a lack of soil cohesion and, because tree roots absorb water from the soil and allow it to absorb more water, it creates an ideal environment for flooding. A flat, treeless surface is perfect for flash floods. Flash flood has been the deadliest disaster that struck and killed hundreds of people in the cities of Cagyan de Oro and Iligan (Villanueva, 2011) last December  2011.\\n\\n                       The sixth effect of deforestation is global warming. Global warming is a phenomenon (greenhouse effect) whereby solar radiation that has reflected back off the surface of the earth remains trapped at atmospheric levels, due to the build-up of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, rather than being emitted back into space (Starr, 2006).\\n\\nThe major greenhouse gases and their sources/causes are:\\n\\nCarbon dioxide (CO2)\\n	-Fossil fuel, deforestation, animal respiration.\\n\\nMethane (CH4)\\n	-Cattle, rice paddies, gas leaks, termites, mining\\n\\nNitrous oxide (N2O)\\n	-Burning of fossil fuels, deforestation.\\n\\nChlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)\\n	-Air conditioning, solvents                             \\n\\nOzone (O3) and other trace gases\\n	-Car exhaust, power plants, photochemicals. \\n\\n\\n                       Global temperature is also rising. Different studies have shown the world’s average temperature has risen by 0.5o F-1.0o F on an average (Lovekar, 2011). The rise in the mean surface air temperature over the past hundred years supports this long term estimate. It is unknown whether the rise is part of Earth’s natural climate cycle or a result of the increase in greenhouse gases from human activity. A study in Canada, analyzing ground surface temperature, has found a one to two degree increase in ground surface temperature at the time of deforestation at each site (Swemson, 2011).\\n\\n                        The possible ways to protect and preserve the forests may include the following: reforestation, educating the farmers about deforestation, strict implementation of law about the problem, sustainable forest and water management.\\n\\n                       The first way is reforestation. It is causing a forest to occur again. This can be done by letting deforested land go fallow for several years or by replanting native species in open areas or adjacent to remaining forest. Here in Mindanao, some government and non-government organizations are doing tree planting projects. They plant trees to lessen the effect of climate change and recover what has been damaged by logging in the forest. The Philippine government supplies the seedlings but according to Pres. Benigno Aquino III there is an inadequate supply of seedlings that we could use in the country (Porcalla, 2011).\\n\\n                       The second way is educating the farmers.  There are peasant farmers who have left their traditional farm lands in search of new opportunities on the forest frontier. With a growing local population, restricted access to arable land, and few economic alternatives they have been forced to migrate to forested state lands to establish a new farm and homestead. They become prisoners of illiteracy and endemic poverty, and driven by the lack of access to arable lands and the lack of alternative employment opportunities, subsistence farming families must survive by clearing the forests to plant their crops. Though education, they can be responsible farmers. They must know the importance of our forests. The government may also give them alternative source of income like sustainable livelihood projects instead of clearing the forest to be converted in agricultural lands.\\n\\n                       The third way is the strict implementation of the laws concerning about deforestation. The authorities must strictly impose penalties to the one who breaks the law. Here in our country, Philippines, these are examples of the law of our government to fight deforestation: DENR Memorandum No. 52 and Executive Order No. 23.\\n\\n                      DENR(Department of Environment and Natural Resources) Memorandum No. 52 is limiting the processing of application permits of forest tenure holders within their plantation sites only (Villanueva, 2011). Environment and Natural Resources Ramon Paje announced last year, 2011, that chainsaws, bulldozers graders, and other logging tools and implements are now off-limits in natural and residual forests nationwide.\\n\\n                       Executive Order No. 23 is declaring a logging ban. President Benigno Aquino III issued the ban after visiting the provinces hit by floods and landslides in the country.\\n\\n                       The fourth way is sustainable forest and water management. According to Dr. Victor Rex Cruz, dean of the UP College of Forestry and Natural Resources, a sustainable forest management program to put in a place to assure sustainable harvest from natural forest, more investments in plantations and tree industries, and protection of watershed and protected areas while assuring the continuity of forest products and environmental services from all types of forests (Porcalla, 2011).\\n\\n                        Therefore, deforestation has a great impact in our society. It threatens not only biodiversity but it also endangers us humans which should protect the forest. It is true that it gives economic improvement to us but it also gives bad environmental effects. Controlling the problem is not a simple matter of enacting new laws and enforcing new regulations because laws and regulations already exist. What we need to do is to follow and obey this laws and regulations to lessen the bad effects of deforestation. We should be part of the solution and not adding to the problem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n•	Bora, C.

Environmental issues in India are many. Air pollution, water pollution, garbage pollution and wildlife natural habitat pollution challenge India. The situation was worse between 1947 through 1995. According to data collection and environment assessment studies of World Bank experts, between 1995 through 2010, India has made one of the fastest progress in the world, in addressing its environmental issues and improving its environmental quality.[1][2] Still, India has a long way to go to reach environmental quality similar to those enjoyed in developed economies. Pollution remains a major challenge and opportunity for India.\\n\\nSome believe economic development is leading to environmental issues in India. Others believe economic development is key to improving India's environmental management and preventing pollution in India.\\n\\nSome suggest India's growing population is the primary cause of India's environmental degradation. Systematic studies challenge this theory. Empirical evidence from countries such as Japan, England and Singapore, each with population density similar or higher than India, yet each enjoying environmental quality vastly superior than India, suggests population density may not be the only factor affecting India's issues.[3]\\n\\nMajor environmental issues are forest and agricultural degradation of land, resource depletion (water, mineral, forest, sand, rocks etc.), environmental degradation, public health, loss of biodiversity, loss of resilience in ecosystems, livelihood security for the poor.[4]\\n\\nThe major sources of pollution in India include the rampant burning of fuelwood and biomass such as dried waste from livestock as the primary source of energy,[5] lack of organized garbage and waste removal services, lack of sewage treatment operations, lack of flood control and monsoon water drainage system, diversion of consumer waste into rivers, cremation practices near major rivers, government mandated protection of highly polluting old public transport, and continued operation by Indian government of government owned, high emission plants built between 1950 to 1980.[6][7][8][9][10]\\n\\nIndia's water supply and sanitation issues are related to many environmental issues.\\n\\nEnvironmental issues are one of the primary causes of disease, health issues and long term livelihood impact for India.\\nContents\\n [hide] \\n\\n    * 1 History\\n    * 2 Major issues\\n          o 2.1 Population growth and environmental quality\\n    * 3 Pollution\\n          o 3.1 Water pollution\\n          o 3.2 Recent efforts to address water issues\\n          o 3.3 Air pollution\\n          o 3.4 Solid waste pollution\\n          o 3.5 Noise pollution\\n          o 3.6 Land pollution\\n    * 4 Environmental issues and Indian law\\n    * 5 Conservation\\n    * 6 See also\\n    * 7 References\\n    * 8 Further reading\\n    * 9 External links\\n\\n[edit] History\\nAshoka Pillar Edicts were one of earliest efforts in India focussed on respecting and preserving environment, forests and wildlife.\\n\\nYajnavalkya Smriti, a historic Indian text on statecraft and jurisprudence, suggested to have been written before 5th century AD, prohibited the cutting of trees and prescribed punishment for such acts. Kautalya's Arthashastra, written in India's Mauryan period, emphasized the need for forest administration. Ashoka went further, and his Pillar Edicts expressed his view about the welfare of environment and biodiversity.\\n\\n    "Happiness in this world and the next is difficult to obtain without much love for the dhamma, much self-examination, much respect, much fear of evil, and much enthusiasm. [...] Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi (Ashoka), speaks thus: Animals were declared to be protected – parrots, mainas, aruna, geese, wild ducks, nandimukhas, gelatas, bats, queen ants, terrapins, boneless fish, vedareyaka, gangapuputaka, sankiya fish, tortoises, porcupines, squirrels, deer, bulls, okapinda, wild asses, wild pigeons, domestic pigeons and all four-footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible. Also protected were nanny goats, ewes and sows which are with young or giving milk to their young, and so are young ones less than six months old. Cocks are not to be caponized, husks hiding living beings are not to be burnt, and forests are not to be burnt either without reason or to kill creatures. One animal is not to be fed to another. Our king killed very few animals."\\n\\n    — Ashoka's Seven Pillar Edicts[11]\\n\\nBritish rule of India saw several laws related to environment. Amongst the earliest ones were Shore Nuisance (Bombay and Kolaba) Act of 1853 and the Oriental Gas Company Act of 1857. The Indian Penal Code of 1860, imposed a fine on anyone who voluntarily fouls the water of any public spring or reservoir. In addition, the Code penalised negligent acts. British India also enacted laws aimed at controlling air pollution. Prominent amongst these were the Bengal Smoke Nuisance Act of 1905 and the Bombay Smoke Nuisance Act of 1912. While these laws failed in having the intended effect, British-enacted legislations pioneered the growth of environmental regulations in India.\\n\\nUpon independence from Britain, India adopted a constitution and numerous British-enacted laws, without any specific constitutional provision on protecting environment. India amended its constitution in 1976. Article 48(A) of Part IV of the amended constitution, read: The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country. Article 51 A(g) imposed additional environmental mandates on the Indian state.\\n\\nOther Indian laws from recent history include the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1974, the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981. The Air Act was inspired by the decisions made at Stockholm Conference. The Bhopal gas tragedy triggered the Government of India to enact the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986. India has also enacted a set of Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules in 2000.\\n\\nIn 1985, Indian government created the Ministry of Environment and Forests. This ministry is the central administrative organisation in India for regulating and ensuring environmental protection.\\n\\nDespite active passage of laws by the central government of India, the reality of environmental quality mostly worsened between 1947 to 1990. Most of Indian economy was nationalized and owned by India, and regulations were mostly ignored by state run enterprises. Rural poor had no choice, but to sustain life in whatever way possible. The state governments of India often regarded environmental laws enacted by the central government as a mere paperwork formality. Air emissions increased, water pollution worsened, forest cover decreased.\\n\\nStarting in 1990s, reforms were introduced. Since then, for the first time in Indian history, major air pollutant concentrations have dropped in every 5 year period. Between 1992 to 2010, satellite data confirms India's forest coverage has increased for the first time by over 4 million hectares, a 7% increase.[12]\\n[edit] Major issues\\nFloods are a significant environmental issue for India. It causes soil erosion, destruction of wetlands and wide migration of solid wastes.\\n\\nAir pollution, poor management of waste, growing water scarcity, falling groundwater tables, water pollution, preservation and quality of forests, biodiversity loss, and land/soil degradation are some of the major environmental issues India faces today.[13]\\n\\nIndia's population growth adds pressure to environmental issues and its resources.\\n\\nEnvironmental issues in India include various natural hazards, particularly cyclones and annual monsoon floods. An estimated 60% of cultivated land suffers from soil erosion, waterlogging, and salinity. It is also estimated that between 4.7 and 12 billion tons of topsoil are lost annually from soil erosion.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe Indian Agricultural Research Institute of Parvati has estimated that a 3 °C rise in temperature will result in a 15 to 20% loss in annual wheat yields.[citation needed] These are substantial problems for a nation with such a large population depending on the productivity of primary resources and whose economic growth relies heavily on industrial growth. Civil conflicts involving natural resources—most notably forests and arable land—have occurred in eastern and northeastern states.\\n[edit] Population growth and environmental quality\\n\\nThere is a long history of study and debate about the interactions between population growth and the environment. According to the British thinker Malthus, for example, a growing population exerts pressure on agricultural land, causing environmental degradation, and forcing the cultivation of land of poorer and poorer quality. This environmental degradation ultimately reduces agricultural yields and food availability, causes famines and diseases and death, thereby reducing the rate of population growth. Population growth, because it can place increased pressure on the assimilative capacity of the environment, is also seen as a major cause of air, water, and solid-waste pollution. The result, Malthus theorized, is an equilibrium population that enjoys low levels of both income and environmental quality. Malthus suggested positive and preventative forced control of human population, along with abolition of poor laws.\\n\\nMalthus theory, published between 1798 and 1826, has been analyzed and criticized ever since. The American thinker Henry George, for example, observed with his characteristic piquancy in dismissing Malthus: "Both the jayhawk and the man eat chickens; but the more jayhawks, the fewer chickens, while the more men, the more chickens." Similarly, the American economist Julian Lincoln Simon criticised Malthus's theory.[14] He noted that the facts of human history have proven the predictions of Malthus and of the Neo-Malthusians to be flawed. Massive geometric population growth in the 20th century did not result in a Malthusian catastrophe. The possible reasons include: increase in human knowledge, rapid increases in productivity, innovation and application of knowledge, general improvements in farming methods (industrial agriculture), mechanization of work (tractors), the introduction of high-yield varieties of wheat and other plants (Green Revolution), the use of pesticides to control crop pests.[15]\\n\\nMore recent scholarly articles concede that while there is no question that population growth may contribute to environmental degradation, its effects can be modified by economic growth and modern technology.[16] Research in environmental economics has uncovered a relationship between environmental quality, measured by ambient concentrations of air pollutants and per capita income. This so-called environmental Kuznets curve shows environmental quality worsening up until about $5,000 of per capita income on purchasing parity basis, and improving thereafter.[17] The key requirement, for this to be true, is continued adoption of technology and scientific management of resources, continued increases in productivity in every economic sector, entrepreneurial innovation and economic expansion.\\n\\nOther data suggests that population density has little correlation to environmental quality and human quality of life. India's population density, in 2011, was about 368 human beings per square kilometer. Many countries with population density similar or higher than India enjoy environmental quality as well as human quality of life far superior than India. For example: Singapore (7148 /km2), Hong Kong-China (6349 /km2), South Korea (487 /km2), Netherlands (403 /km2), Belgium (355 / km2), Japan (337/ km2), England (395 /km2), the state of Florida (353 / km2), the state of New York (412 / km2), the state of Massachusetts (840 / km2), the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (523 / km2), the region of Île-de-France (974 / km2), and the region of Lombardy (417 / km2).\\n[edit] Pollution\\n[edit] Water pollution\\nSee also: Water supply and sanitation in India\\nHanskhali drainage canal, it passes contaminated water direct to the Ganges at Howrah, West Bengal. Sewage and drainage canals like this are the dominant cause of water pollution in India.\\n\\nA 2007 study finds that discharge of untreated sewage is single most important cause for pollution of surface and ground water in India. There is a large gap between generation and treatment of domestic wastewater in India. The problem is not only that India lacks sufficient treatment capacity but also that the sewage treatment plants that exist do not operate and are not maintained. Majority of the government-owned sewage treatment plants remain closed most of the time due to improper design or poor maintenance or lack of reliable electricity supply to operate the plants, together with absentee employees and poor management. The wastewater generated in these areas normally percolates in the soil or evaporates. The uncollected wastes accumulate in the urban areas cause unhygienic conditions and release pollutants that leaches to surface and groundwater.[18]\\n\\nA 1992 World Health Organization study is claimed to have reported that out of India's 3,119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial sewage treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities.[19] Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. A 1995 report claimed 114 Indian cities were dumping untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River.[20] Open defecation is widespread even in urban areas of India.[21][22] This situation is typical of India as well as other developing countries.\\n\\nAccording to another 2005 report, sewage discharged from cities and towns is the predominant cause of water pollution in India. Investment is needed to bridge the gap between 29000 million litre per day of sewage India generates, and a treatment capacity of mere 6000 million litre per day.[23] A large number of Indian rivers are severely polluted as a result of discharge of domestic sewage.\\n\\nThe Central Pollution Control Board, a Ministry of Environment & Forests Government of India entity, has established a National Water Quality Monitoring Network comprising 1429 monitoring stations in 27 states and 6 in Union Territories on various rivers and water bodies across the country. This effort monitors water quality year round. The monitoring network covers 293 rivers, 94 lakes, 9 tanks, 41 ponds, 8 creeks, 23 canals, 18 drains and 411 wells distributed across India.[24] Water samples are routinely analyzed for 28 parameters including dissolved oxygen, bacteriological and other internationally established parameters for water quality. Additionally 9 trace metals parameters and 28 pesticide residues are analyzed. Biomonitoring is also carried out on specific locations.\\n\\nThe scientific analysis of water samples from 1995 to 2008 indicates that the organic and bacterial contamination are severe in water bodies of India. This is mainly due to discharge of domestic wastewater in untreated form, mostly from the urban centers of India.\\n\\nIn 2008, the water quality monitoring found almost all rivers with high levels of BOD. The worst pollution, in decreasing order, were found in river Markanda (590 mg O/l), followed by river Kali (364), river Amlakhadi (353), Yamuna canal (247), river Yamuna at Delhi (70) and river Betwa (58). For context, a water sample with a 5 day BOD between 1 and 2 mg O/L indicates a very clean water, 3 to 8 mg O/L indicates a moderately clean water, 8 to 20 indicates borderline water, and greater than 20 mg O/L indicates ecologically-unsafe polluted water.\\n\\nThe Mithi River, which flows through the city of Mumbai, is heavily polluted.\\n\\nThe levels of BOD are severe near the cities and major towns. In rural parts of India, the river BOD levels were sufficient to support aquatic life.\\n\\nTotal coliform and fecal coliform densities in the rivers of India range between 500 to 100,000 MPN/100 ml.[24] The presence of coliform suggests that the water is being contaminated with the fecal material of humans, livestocks, pets and other animals. Rivers Yamuna, Ganga, Gomti, Ghaggar, Chambal, Mahi, Vardha are amongst the other most coliform polluted water bodies in India. For context, coliform must be below 104 MPN/100 ml,[25] preferably absent from water for it to be considered safe for general human use, and for irrigation where coliform may cause disease outbreak from contaminated-water in agriculture.[26][27]\\n\\nIn 2006, 47 percent of water quality monitoring stations in India reported a total average annual coliform levels above 500 MPN/100 ml. During 2008, 33 percent of all water quality monitoring stations reported a total coliform levels exceeding those levels, suggesting recent effort to add pollution control infrastructure and upgrade treatment plants in India, may be reversing the water pollution trend.\\n\\nTreatment of domestic sewage and subsequent utilization of treated sewage for irrigation can prevent pollution of water bodies, reduce the demand for fresh water in irrigation sector and become a resource for irrigation. Since 2005, Indian wastewater treatment plant market has been growing annually at the rate of 10 to 12 percent. The United States is the largest supplier of treatment equipment and supplies to India, with 40 percent market share of new installation.[28] At this rate of expansion, and assuming the government of India continues on its path of reform, major investments in sewage treatment plants and electricity infrastructure development, India will nearly triple its water treatment capacity by 2015, and treatment capacity supply will match India's daily sewage water treatment requirements by about 2020.\\n\\nWater resources have not been linked to either domestic or international violent conflict as was previously anticipated by some observers. Possible exceptions, notes a 2004 report, include some communal violence related to distribution of water from the Kaveri River and political tensions surrounding actual and potential population displacements by dam projects, particularly on the Narmada River.[29] A 1997 article claimed Punjab is another hotbed of pollution, for example, Buddha Nullah, a rivulet which run through Malwa region of Punjab, India, and after passing through highly populated Ludhiana district, before draining into Sutlej River, a tributary of the Indus river, is today an important case point in the recent studies, which suggest this as another Bhopal in making.[30]\\n\\nA joint study by PGIMER and Punjab Pollution Control Board in 2008, revealed that in villages along the Nullah, calcium, magnesium, fluoride, mercury, beta-endosulphan and heptachlor pesticide were more than permissible limit (MPL) in ground and tap waters. Plus the water had high concentration of COD and BOD (chemical and biochemical oxygen demand), ammonia, phosphate, chloride, chromium, arsenic and chlorpyrifos pesticide. The ground water also contains nickel and selenium, while the tap water has high concentration of lead, nickel and cadmium.[31] The Hindon River, which flows through the city of Ghaziabad, highly polluted and groundwater of this city has colored and poisoned by industrial effluents, Hindon Vahini is strongly opposing of water pollution activities.\\n\\nFlooding during monsoons worsens India's water pollution problem, as it washes and moves all sorts of solid garbage and contaminated soils into its rivers and wetlands.\\n\\nThe annual average precipitation in India is about 4000 billion cubic metres.[23] From this, with the state of Indian infrastructure in 2005, the available water resource through the rivers is about 1869 billion cubic meters. Accounting to uneven distribution of rain over the country each year, water resources available for utilization, including ground water, is claimed to be about 1122 billion cubic meters. Much of this water is unsafe, because pollution degrades water quality. Water pollution severely limits the amount of water available to Indian consumer, its industry and its agriculture.\\n\\nThe Ganges\\n\\nMillions depend on the polluted Ganges river.\\nMain article: Pollution of the Ganges\\n\\n    To know why 1,000 Indian children die of diarrhoeal sickness every day, take a wary stroll along the Ganges in Varanasi. As it enters the city, Hinduism’s sacred river contains 60,000 faecal coliform bacteria per 100 millilitres, 120 times more than is considered safe for bathing. Four miles downstream, with inputs from 24 gushing sewers and 60,000 pilgrim-bathers, the concentration is 3,000 times over the safety limit. In places, the Ganges becomes black and septic. Corpses, of semi-cremated adults or enshrouded babies, drift slowly by.\\n\\n    — The Economist on December 11, 2008[32]\\n\\nMore than 400 million people live along the Ganges River. An estimated 2,000,000 persons ritually bathe daily[citation needed] in the river, which is considered holy by Hindus. In the Hindu religion it is said to flow from the lotus feet of Vishnu (for Vaisnava devotees) or the hair of Shiva (for Saivites). The spiritual and religious significance could be compared to what the Nile river meant to the ancient Egyptians. While the Ganges may be considered holy, there are some problems associated with the ecology. It is filled with chemical wastes[citation needed], sewage and even the remains of human and animal corpses which carry major health risks by either direct bathing in the water, or by drinking (the Fecal-oral route).\\n\\nThe Yamuna\\n\\nThe Taj Mahal next to the polluted Yamuna river.\\nMain article: Yamuna\\n\\nNewsWeek describes Delhi's sacred Yamuna River as "a putrid ribbon of black sludge" where fecal bacteria is 10,000 over safety limits despite a 15-year program to address the problem.[33] Cholera epidemics are not unknown.[33] NewsWeek observes India's messy democracy is particularly ill equipped to handle the conflicting pressures of rapid growth and poverty. Even though India revised its national water policy in 2002 to encourage community participation and decentralize water management, the country's Byzantine bureaucracy ensures that it remains a "mere statement of intent." Responsibility for managing water issues is fragmented among a dozen different ministries and departments without any coordination. The government bureaucracy and state-run project department has failed to solve the problem, despite having spent many years and $500 million on this project.\\n[edit] Recent efforts to address water issues\\n\\nThe government of India envisions a US$100 billion project to interlink all major river networks in India.[34] This initiative would connect water-deficient areas to water-abundant ones by interlinking 37 Indian rivers.[35] One of the largest projects anywhere in the world, it would transfer water through 30 links across 9,600 kilometers. It would connect 32 dams and use 56 million tons of cement and 2 million tons of steel. The project aims a transformation of India's water treatment, management, transmission and distribution. The Indian government has proposed reforms to attract investment and privatization of its water networks. Water companies from all over the world have established a presence in India to pursue an estimated 70 projects worth several billion dollars in 20 Indian cities.[28] India is debating the social and environmental impact of this project. One of the first projects under consideration is the linking of Ken and Betwa rivers in northern India.\\n[edit] Air pollution\\nCooking fuel in rural India is prepared from a wet mix of dried grass, fuelwood pieces, hay, leaves and mostly cow/livestock dung. This mix is patted down into disc-shaped cakes, dried, and then used as fuel in stoves. When it burns, it produces smoke and numerous indoor air pollutants at concentrations 5 times higher than coal.\\nA rural stove using biomass cakes, fuelwood and trash as cooking fuel. Surveys suggest over 100 million households in India use such stoves (chullahs) every day, 2-3 times a day. Clean burning fuels and electricity are unavailable in rural parts and small towns of India because of poor rural highways and limited energy generation infrastructure.\\nAir pollution is high in Indian cities.\\nTraffic congestion on inadequate road infrastructure is a daily reality of India's urban centers. Slow speeds and idling vehicles produce, per trip, 4 to 8 times more pollutants and consume more carbon footprint fuels, than free flowing traffic. This 2008 image shows traffic congestion in Delhi.\\nSee also: Global warming in India\\n\\nFuel wood and biomass burning\\n\\nFuelwood and biomass burning is the primary reason for near-permanent haze and smoke observed above rural and urban India, and in satellite pictures of the country. Fuelwood and biomass cakes are used for cooking and general heating needs. These are burnt in cook stoves known as chullah or chulha in some parts of India. These cook stoves are present in over 100 million Indian households, and are used two to three times a day, daily. As of 2009, majority of Indians still use traditional fuels such as dried cow dung, agricultural wastes, and firewood as cooking fuel.[36] This form of fuel is inefficient source of energy, its burning releases high levels of smoke, PM10 particulate matter, NOX, SOX, PAHs, polyaromatics, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and other air pollutants.[5][37][38][39] Some reports, including one by the World Health Organization, claim 300,000 to 400,000 people die of indoor air pollution and carbon monoxide poisoning in India because of biomass burning and use of chullahs.[40] Burning of biomass and firewood will not stop, unless electricity or clean burning fuel and combustion technologies become reliably available and widely adopted in rural and urban India.\\n\\nIndia is the world's largest consumer of fuelwood, agricultural waste and biomass for energy purposes. From the most recent available nationwide study, India used 148.7 million tonnes coal replacement worth of fuelwood and biomass annually for domestic energy use. India's national average annual per capita consumption of fuel wood, agri wate and biomass cakes was 206 kilogram coal equivalent. In 2010 terms, with India's population increased to about 1.2 billion, the country burns over 200 million tonnes of coal replacement worth of fuel wood and biomass every year to meet its energy need for cooking and other domestic use. The study found that the households consumed around 95 million tonnes of fuelwood, one-third of which was logs and the rest was twigs. Twigs were mostly consumed in the villages, and logs were more popular in cities of India. The overall contribution of fuelwood, including sawdust and wood waste, was about 46% of the total, the rest being agri waste and biomass dung cakes. Traditional fuel (fuelwood, crop residue and dung cake) dominates domestic energy use in rural India and accounts for about 90% of the total. In urban areas, this traditional fuel constitutes about 24% of the total.[41]\\n\\nFuel wood, agri waste and biomass cake burning releases over 165 million tonnes of combustion products into India's indoor and outdoor air every year. To place this volume of emission in context, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the United States estimates that fire wood smoke contributes over 420,000 tonnes of fine particles throughout the United States – mostly during the winter months. United States consumes about one-tenth of fuelwood consumed by India, and mostly for fire place and home heating purposes. EPA estimates that residential wood combustion in the USA accounts for 44 percent of total organic matter emissions and 62 percent of the PAH, which are probable human carcinogens and are of great concern to EPA. The fuelwood sourced residential wood smoke makes up over 50 percent of the wintertime particle pollution problem in California.[42] In 2010, the state of California had about the same number of vehicles as all of India.\\n\\nIndia burns tenfold more fuelwood every year than the United States, the fuelwood quality in India is different than the dry firewood of the United States, and the Indian stoves in use are less efficient thereby producing more smoke and air pollutants per kilogram equivalent. India has less land area and less emission air space than the United States. In summary, the impact on indoor and outdoor air pollution by fuelwood and biomass cake burning is far worse in India.\\n\\nA United Nations study[43] finds firewood and biomass stoves can be made more efficient in India. Animal dung, now used in inefficient stoves, could be used to produce biogas, a cleaner fuel with higher utilization efficiency. In addition, an excellent fertilizer can be produced from the slurry from biogas plants. Switching to gaseous fuels would bring the greatest gains in terms of both thermal efficiency and reduction in air pollution, but would require more investment. A combination of technologies may be the best way forward.\\n\\nBetween 2001 and 2010, India has made progress in adding electrical power generation capacity, bringing electricity to rural areas, and reforming market to improve availability and distribution of liquified cleaner burning fuels in urban and rural area. Over the same period, scientific data collection and analysis show improvement in India's air quality, with some regions witnessing 30 to 65% reduction in NOx, SOx and suspended particulate matter. Even at these lower levels, the emissions are higher than those recommended by the World Health Organization. Continued progress is necessary.\\n\\nScientific studies conclude biomass combustion in India is the country's dominant source of carbonaceous aerosols, emitting 0.25 teragram per year of black carbon into air, 0.94 teragram per year of organic matter, and 2.04 teragram per year of small particulates with diameter less than 2.5 microns. Biomass burning, as domestic fuel in India, accounts for about 3 times as much black carbon air pollution as all other sources combined, including vehicles and industrial sources.[44]\\n\\nOther sources of pollution in Indian cities are vehicles and emissions from industry. Until 1992, India protected its automobile industry using license raj. Many two wheel, three wheel and four wheel vehicles lacked catalytic converters. Per vehicle emissions were amongst the highest in the world. The refining of oil and supply of fuel was owned, regulated and run by the government; the fuel quality was lax.\\n\\nIn 2005, India adopted emission standard of Bharat Stage IV for vehicles, which is equivalent to Euro IV European standards for vehicle emissions. Nevertheless, the old pre-2005 vehicles, and even pre-1992 vehicles are still on Indian streets.\\n\\nFuel adulteration\\n\\nSome Indian taxis and auto-rickshaws run on adulterated fuel blends. Adulteration of gasoline and diesel with lower-priced fuels is common in South Asia, including India.[45] Some adulterants increase emissions of harmful pollutants from vehicles, worsening urban air pollution. Financial incentives arising from differential taxes are generally the primary cause of fuel adulteration. In India and other developing countries, gasoline carries a much higher tax than diesel, which in turn is taxed more than kerosene meant as a cooking fuel, while some solvents and lubricants carry little or no tax. As fuel prices rise, the public transport driver cuts costs by blending the cheaper hydrocarbon into highly taxed hydrocarbon. The blending may be as much as 20-30 percent. For a low wage driver, the adulteration can yield short term savings that are significant over the month. The consequences to long term air pollution, quality of life and effect on health are simply ignored. Also ignored are the reduced life of vehicle engine and higher maintenance costs, particularly if the taxi, auto-rickshaw or truck is being rented for a daily fee.\\n\\nAdulterated fuel increases tailpipe emissions of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). Air toxin emissions — which fall into the category of unregulated emissions — of primary concern are benzene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), both well known carcinogens. Kerosene is more difficult to burn than gasoline; its addition results in higher levels of HC, CO and PM emissions even from catalyst-equipped cars. The higher sulfur level of kerosene is another issue. The permissible level of fuel sulfur in India, in 2002, was 0.25 percent by weight as against 0.10 percent for gasoline. The higher levels of sulfur can deactivate the catalyst. Once the catalyst becomes deactivated, the amount of pollution from the vehicle dramatically increases. Fuel adulteration is essentially an unintended consequence of tax policies and the attempt to control fuel prices, in the name of fairness. Air pollution is the ultimate result. This problem is not unique to India, but prevalent in many developing countries including those outside of south Asia. This problem is largely absent in economies that do not regulate the ability of fuel producers to innovate or price based on market demand.\\n\\nTraffic congestion\\n\\nTraffic congestion is severe in India's cities and towns. Traffic congestion is caused for several reasons, some of which are: increase in number of vehicles per kilometer of available road, a lack of intra-city divided-lane highways and intra-city expressways networks, lack of inter-city expressways, traffic accidents and chaos from poor enforcement of traffic laws.\\n\\nTraffic congestion reduces average traffic speed. At low speeds, scientific studies reveal, vehicles burn fuel inefficiently and pollute more per trip. For example, a study in the United States found that for the same trip, cars consumed more fuel and polluted more if the traffic was congested, than when traffic flowed freely. At average trip speeds between 20 to 40 kilometers per hour, the cars pollutant emission was twice as much as when the average speed was 55 to 75 kilometers per hour. At average trip speeds between 5 to 20 kilometers per hour, the cars pollutant emissions were 4 to 8 times as much as when the average speed was 55 to 70 kilometers per hour.[46] Fuel efficiencies similarly were much worse with traffic congestion.\\n\\nTraffic gridlock in Delhi and other India cities is extreme.[47] The average trip speed on many Indian city roads is less than 20 kilometers per hour; a 10 kilometer trip can take 30 minutes, or more. At such speeds, vehicles in India emit air pollutants 4 to 8 times more than they would with less traffic congestion; Indian vehicles also consume a lot more carbon footprint fuel per trip, than they would if the traffic congestion was less.\\n\\nIn cities like Bangalore, around 50% of children suffer from asthma.[48]\\n\\nRecent trends in India's air quality\\n\\nMonsoons scrub India's air, bringing its natural diversity in better view.\\nHimalayan peaks in eastern India on a day without haze.\\n\\nWith the last 15 years of economic development and regulatory reforms, India has made progress in improving its air quality. The table presents the average emissions sampled at many locations, over time, and data analyzed by scientific methods, by multiple agencies, including The World Bank. For context and comparison, the table also includes average values for Sweden in 2008, observed and analyzed by same methods. Over 1995-2008, average nationwide levels of major air pollutants have dropped by between 25-45 percent in India.\\nAir quality, trends over 1995-2008, averaged for India Air quality indicator[49] 	India 	India 	India 	Sweden\\n	1995 	2005 	2008 	2008\\nPollutant, PM10 (micrograms per cubic meter) 	109 	67 	59 	11\\nPollutant, CO2 emissions (kg per 2005 PPP$ of GDP) 	0.7 	0.6 	0.5 	0.2\\nHealth, mortality rate (under 5, per 1000) 	100 	73 	67 	3\\nPollutant, methane, Agriculture emissions (% total) 	68.8 	64.4 	n.a. 	28.1\\nPollutant, nitrous oxide, Agriculture emissions (% total) 	75.2 	73.4 	n.a. 	60.2\\n\\nIndia's Central Pollution Control Board now routinely monitors four air pollutants namely sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), suspended particulate matter (SPM) and respirable particulate matter (PM10). These are target air pollutants for regular monitoring at 308 operating stations in 115 cities/towns in 25 states and 4 Union Territories of India. The monitoring of meteorological parameters such as wind speed and direction, relative humidity and temperature has also been integrated with the monitoring of air quality. The monitoring of these pollutants is carried out for 24 hours (4-hourly sampling for gaseous pollutants and 8-hourly sampling for particulate matter) with a frequency of twice a week, to yield 104 observations in a year.\\n\\nFor 2010, the key findings of India's central pollution control board are:[50]\\n\\n    * Most Indian cities continue to violate India's and world air quality PM10 targets. Respirable particulate matter pollution remains a key challenge for India. Despite the general non-attainment, some cities showed far more improvement than others. A decreasing trend has been observed in PM10 levels in cities like Solapur and Ahmedabad over the last few years. This improvement may be due to local measures taken to reduce sulphur in diesel and stringent enforcement by Gujarat government.\\n    * A decreasing trend has been observed in sulphur dioxide levels in residential areas of many cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Bhopal during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced clean fuel standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood, and the use of LPG instead of diesel in certain vehicles.\\n    * A decreasing trend has been observed in nitrogen dioxide levels in residential areas of some cities such as Bhopal and Solapur during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced vehicle emission standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood.\\n    * Most Indian cities greatly exceed acceptable levels of suspended particulate matter. This may be because of refuse and biomass burning, vehicles, power plant emissions, industrial sources.\\n    * The Indian air quality monitoring stations reported lower levels of PM10 and suspended particulate matter during monsoon months possibly due to wet deposition and air scrubbing by rainfall. Higher levels of particulates were observed during winter months possibly due to lower mixing heights and more calm conditions. In other words, India's air quality worsens in winter months, and improves with the onset of monsoon season.\\n\\nFor its 2008 annual report, Central Pollution Control Board used 346 operating Air Quality Monitoring Stations, covering 130 cities / towns in 26 States and 4 Union Territories. With the weekly data collected and then averaged over the year, Central Pollution Control Board reported the following annual trends from 1998 to 2008:[24]\\n\\n    * The average annual SOx and NOx emissions level and periodic violations in industrial areas of India were significantly and surprisingly lower than the emission and violations in residential areas of India.\\n    * The 24-hour average PM10 and suspended particulate matter emissions and violations in almost all areas of India violated India's and WHO targets. The PM10 and suspended particulate matter concentrations, in industrial areas of India were, however, lower than those in residential areas of India. Residential areas of India were the source of over 90% of the most serious and repeated violations in particulate air pollution.\\n    * Of the four major Indian cities, air pollution was consistently worst in Delhi, every year over 5 year period (2004–2008). Kolkata was a close second, followed by Mumbai. Chennai air pollution was least of the four.\\n    * The states of Kerala and Meghalaya, relative to other Indian states, experienced on average some of lowest air pollution levels. The cities of Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam and Shillong, relative to other Indian cities and towns, experienced some of lowest air pollution levels.\\n    * Air Quality data collected from the monitoring station at Taj Mahal, Agra since year 1991 to 2008, suggests that both particulate and acid rain pollutants at Taj Mahal have been declining over the years. The 2008 average annual air pollutant concentrations were between 38 to 67% lower than those in 1991.\\n\\n[edit] Solid waste pollution\\nSolid waste adds to water pollution in India, a 2005 image.\\nTrash and garbage disposal services, responsibility of local government workers in India, are ineffective. Solid waste is routinely seen along India's streets and shopping plazas. Image shows solid waste pollution along a Jaipur street, a 2011 image.\\n\\nTrash and garbage is a common sight in urban and rural areas of India. It is a major source of pollution. Indian cities alone generate more than 100 million tons of solid waste a year. Street corners are piled with trash. Public places and sidewalks are despoiled with filth and litter, rivers and canals act as garbage dumps. In part, India's garbage crisis is from rising consumption. India's waste problem also points to a stunning failure of governance.[7]\\n\\nIn 2000, India's Supreme Court directed all Indian cities to implement a comprehensive waste-management program that would include household collection of segregated waste, recycling and composting. These directions have simply been ignored. No major city runs a comprehensive program of the kind envisioned by the Supreme Court. Indeed, forget waste segregation and recycling directive of the India's Supreme Court, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that up to 40 percent of municipal waste in India remains simply uncollected. Even medical waste, theoretically controlled by stringent rules that require hospitals to operate incinerators, is routinely dumped with regular municipal garbage. A recent study found that about half of India's medical waste is improperly disposed of.\\n\\nMunicipalities in Indian cities and towns have waste collection employees. However, these are unionized government workers and their work performance is neither measured nor monitored.\\n\\nSome of the few solid waste landfills India has, near its major cities, are overflowing and poorly managed. They have become significant sources of greenhouse emissions and breeding sites for disease vectors such as flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches, rats, and other pests.[51]\\n\\nIn 2011, several Indian cities embarked on waste-to-energy projects of the type in use in Germany, Switzerland and Japan.[52] For example, New Delhi is implementing two incinerator projects aimed at turning the city’s trash problem into electricity resource. These plants are being welcomed for addressing the city’s chronic problems of excess untreated waste and a shortage of electric power. They are also being welcomed by those who seek to prevent water pollution, hygiene problems, and eliminate rotting trash that produces potent greenhouse gas methane. The projects are being opposed by waste collection workers and local unions who fear changing technology may deprive them of their livelihood and way of life.[53]\\n\\nAlong with waste-to-energy projects, some cities and towns such as Pune, Maharashtra are introducing competition and the privatization of solid waste collection, street cleaning operations and bio-mining to dispose the waste. A scientific study suggests public private partnership is, in Indian context, more useful in solid waste management. According to this study, government and municipal corporations must encourage PPP-based local management through collection, transport and segregation and disposal of solid waste.[54]\\n[edit] Noise pollution\\n[icon] 	This section requires expansion.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court of India gave a significant verdict on noise pollution in 2005.[55] Unnecessary honking of vehicles makes for a high decibel level of noise in cities. The use of loudspeakers for political purposes and by temples and mosques make for noise pollution in residential areas because using more speakers in an programs the noise is increase.\\n\\nIn January 2010, Government of India published norms of permissible noise levels in urban and rural areas.[56]\\n[edit] Land pollution\\n\\nIn March 2009, the issue of Uranium poisoning in Punjab came into light, caused by fly ash ponds of thermal power stations, which reportedly lead to severe birth defects in children in the Faridkot and Bhatinda districts of Punjab.[57][58][59][60]\\n[edit] Environmental issues and Indian law\\n\\nSince about late 1980s, the Supreme Court of India has been pro-actively engaged in India's environmental issues. In most countries, it is the executive and the legislative branches of the government that plan, implement and address environmental issues; the Indian experience is different. The Supreme Court of India has been engaged in interpreting and introducing new changes in the environmental jurisprudence directly. The Court has laid down new principles to protect the environment, re-interpreted environmental laws, created new institutions and structures, and conferred additional powers on the existing ones through a series of directions and judgments. The Court’s directions on environmental issues goes beyond the general questions of law, as is usually expected from the highest Court of a democratic country. The Supreme Court of India, in its order, includes executive actions and technical details of environmental actions to be implemented. Indeed, some critics of India's Supreme Court describe the Court as the Lords of Green Bench or Garbage Supervisor. Supporters of India's Supreme Court term these orders and the Indian bench as pioneering, both in terms of laying down new principles of law, and in delivering environmental justice.[61]\\n\\nThe reasons for the increasing interjection of India's Supreme Court in governance arenas are, experts claim, complex. A key factor has been the failure of government agencies and the state owned enterprises in discharging their Constitutional and Statutory duties. This has prompted civil society groups to file public interest complaints with the Courts, particularly the Supreme Court, for suitable remedies.\\n\\nPublic interest litigation and judicial activism on environmental issues extends beyond India's Supreme Court. It includes the High Courts of individual states.\\n\\nIndia's judicial activism on environmental issues has, some suggest, delivered positive effects to the Indian experience. The Supreme Court has, through intense judicial activism, the proponents claim, become a symbol of hope for the people of India. As a result of judicial activism, India's Supreme Court has delivered a new normative regime of rights and insisted that the Indian state cannot act arbitrarily but must act reasonably and in public interest on pain of its action being invalidated by judicial intervention.[62]\\n\\nIndia's judicial activism on environmental issues has, others suggest, had adverse consequences. Public interest cases are repeatedly filed to block infrastructure projects aimed at solving environmental issues in India, such as but not limiting to water works, expressways, land acquisition for projects, and electricity power generation projects. The litigation routinely delays such projects, often for years, while rampant pollution continues in India, and tens of thousands die from the unintended effects of pollution. Even after a stay related to an infrastructure project is vacated, or a court order gives a green light to certain project, new issues become grounds for court notices and new public interest litigation.[63][64][65]\\n\\nJudicial activism in India has, in several key cases, found state-directed economic development ineffective and a failure, then interpreted laws and issued directives that encourage greater competition and free market to reduce environmental pollution. In other cases, the interpretations and directives have preserved industry protection, labor practices and highly polluting state-owned companies detrimental to environmental quality of India.[66]\\n[edit] Conservation\\nGreater adjutant perched on a pile of trash and solid waste in Assam.\\nThe world's rarest monkey, the golden langur.\\nForests of India's Western Ghats\\nForests of Kerala.

Poor air quality, water pollution and garbage pollution - all affect the food and environment quality necessary for ecosystems.\\n\\nIndia is a large and diverse country. Its land area includes regions with some of the world's highest rainfall to very dry deserts, coast line to alpine regions, river deltas to tropical islands. The variety and distribution of forest vegetation is large. India is one of the 12 mega biodiverse regions of the world.\\n\\nIndian forests types include tropical evergreens, tropical deciduous, swamps, mangroves, sub-tropical, montane, scrub, sub-alpine and alpine forests. These forests support a variety of ecosystems with diverse flora and fauna.\\n\\nUntil recently, India lacked an objective way to determine the quantity of forests it had, and the quality of forests it had.\\n\\nForest cover measurement methods\\n\\nPrior to 1980s, India deployed a bureaucratic method to estimate forest coverage. A land was notified as covered under Indian Forest Act, and then officials deemed this land area as recorded forest even if it was devoid of vegetation. By this forest-in-name-only method, the total amount of recorded forest, per official Indian records, was 71.8 million hectares. Any comparison of forest coverage number of a year before 1987 for India, to current forest coverage in India, is thus meaningless; it is just bureaucratic record keeping, with no relation to reality or meaningful comparison.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, space satellites were deployed for remote sensing of real forest cover. Standards were introduced to classify India's forests into the following categories:\\n\\n    * Forest Cover: defined as all lands, more than one hectare in area, with a tree canopy density of more than 10 percent. (Such lands may or may not be statutorily notified as forest area).\\n          o Very Dense Forest: All lands, with a forest cover with canopy density of 70 percent and above\\n          o Moderately Dense Forest: All lands, with a forest cover with canopy density of 40-70 percent\\n          o Open Forest: All lands, with forest cover with canopy density of 10 to 40 percent\\n          o Mangrove Cover: Mangrove forest is salt tolerant forest ecosystem found mainly in tropical and sub-tropical coastal and/or inter-tidal regions. Mangrove cover is the area covered under mangrove vegetation as interpreted digitally from remote sensing data. It is a part of forest cover and also classified into three classes viz. very dense, moderately dense and open.\\n          o Non Forest Land: defined as lands without any forest cover\\n    * Scrub Cover: All lands, generally in and around forest areas, having bushes and or poor tree growth, chiefly small or stunted trees with canopy density less than 10 percent\\n    * Tree Cover: Land with tree patches (blocks and linear) outside the recorded forest area exclusive of forest cover and less than the minimum mapable area of 1 hectare\\n    * Trees Outside Forests: Trees growing outside Recorded Forest Areas\\n\\nThe first satellite recorded forest coverage data for India became available in 1987. India and the United States cooperated in 2001, using Landsat MSS with spatial resolution of 80 meters, to get accurate Indian forest distribution data. India thereafter switched to digital image and advanced satellites with 23 meters resolution and software processing of images to get more refined data on forest quantity and forest quality. India now assesses its forest distribution data biennially. The 2007 forest census data thus obtained and published by the Government of India suggests the five states with largest area under forest cover as the following:[67]\\n\\n    * Madhya Pradesh: 7.64 million hectares\\n    * Arunachal Pradesh: 6.8 million hectares\\n    * Chhattisgarh: 5.6 million hectares\\n    * Orissa: 4.83 million hectares\\n    * Maharashtra: 4.68 million hectares\\n\\nIndia hosts significant biodiversity; it is home to 7.6% of all mammalian, 12.6% of avian, 6.2% of reptilian, and 6.0% of flowering plant species.[68]\\n\\nIn recent decades, human encroachment has posed a threat to India's wildlife; in response, a system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was substantially expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial habitat; further federal protections were promulgated in the 1980s. Along with over 500 wildlife sanctuaries, India now hosts 14 biosphere reserves, four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; 25 wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.\\n\\nThese laws did not have the effect they intended.\\n\\nIn 1985, India created the Ministry of Environment and Forests. This was followed by a National Forest Policy and the major government reforms of early 1990s.\\n\\nOver the last 20 years, India has reversed the deforestation trend. Specialists of the United Nations report India's forest as well as woodland cover has increased. A 2010 study by the Food and Agriculture Organization ranks India amongst the 10 countries with the largest forest area coverage in the world (the other nine being Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, United States of America, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Australia, Indonesia and Sudan).[12] India is also one the top 10 countries with the largest primary forest coverage in the world, according to this study.\\n\\nFrom 1990 to 2000, FAO finds India was the fifth largest gainer in forest coverage in the world; while from 2000 to 2010, FAO considers India as the third largest gainer in forest coverage.[12]\\n\\nNational Forest Commission and India's afforestation program\\n\\nIn 2003, India set up a National Forest Commission to review and assess India's policy and law, its effect on India's forests, its impact of local forest communities, and to make recommendations to achieve sustainable forest and ecological security in India.[69] The report made over 300 recommendations including the following:\\n\\n    * India must pursue rural development and animal husbandry policies to address local communities need to find affordable cattle fodder and grazing. To avoid destruction of local forest cover, fodder must reach these communities on reliable roads and other infrastructure, in all seasons year round.\\n    * The Forest Rights Bill is likely to be harmful to forest conservation and ecological security. The Forest Rights Bill became a law since 2007.\\n    * The government should work closely with mining companies. Revenue generated from lease of mines must be pooled into a dedicated fund to conserve and improve the quality of forests in the region where the mines are located.\\n    * Power to declare ecologically sensitive areas must be with each Indian state.\\n    * The mandate of State Forest Corporations and government owned monopolies must be changed.\\n    * Government should reform regulations and laws that ban felling of trees and transit of wood within India. Sustainable agro-forestry and farm forestry must be encouraged through financial and regulatory reforms, particularly on privately owned lands.\\n\\nIndia's national forest policy expects to invest US$ 26.7 billion by 2020, to pursue nationwide afforestation coupled with forest conservation, with the goal of increasing India's forest cover from 20% to 33%.[70]
I am a scientist at a university in the American Pacific Northwest studying structural and molecular parasitology.  I look for parasite genes that could be vulnerable to antiparasitic drugs and examine the structures of target parasite proteins for ways to make drugs more potent and less toxic to people.  My focus is to develop better treatments for Trypanosoma cruzi infection, the cause of Chagas disease, and related trypanosomatid Leishmania species.  Along with lab science, I have done advocacy and community building work on affordability of medicines to people living in poverty and development of new health technologies (drugs, diagnostics, vaccines) for neglected infections of poverty.
{{onesource|date=December 2015}}\\n{{short description|Type of emergency that causes severe environmental damage}}\\nAn '''environmental emergency''' is defined as a "sudden-onset disaster or accident resulting from natural, technological or human-induced factors, or a combination of these, that causes or threatens to cause severe environmental damage as well as loss of human lives and property." (UNEP/GC.22/INF/5, 13 November 2002.)\\n\\nFollowing a disaster or conflict, an environmental emergency can occur when people's health and livelihoods are at risk due to the release of hazardous and noxious substances, or because of significant damage to the ecosystem. Examples include fires, [[oil spill]]s, [[chemical accident]]s, [[toxic waste dump]]ing and [[groundwater pollution]]. \\n\\nThe environmental risks can be acute and life-threatening. According to the International Disaster Database ([http://www.emdat.be/ EM-DAT]), between 2003 and 2013, there were 380 industrial accidents reported, affecting 207 668 people and resulting in over US$22 million in losses. Climate change is having an unprecedented effect on the occurrence of natural disasters and the associated risk of environmental emergencies. With climate change already stretching the disaster relief system, future climate-related emergency events will generate increased and more costly demands for assistance.\\n\\n== Context ==\\nAll disasters have some environmental impacts.  \\n\\nSome of these may be immediate and life-threatening – for example, when an earthquake damages an industrial facility, which in turn releases hazardous materials. In such cases these so-called 'secondary impacts' may cause as much damage as the initial causal factor. \\n\\nFor example, [[Typhoon Haiyan]]/Yolanda that struck the Philippines in November 2013, caused massive destruction and had a huge human toll but also generated a spill of around 800,000 litres of heavy oil, when a power barge ran aground in Estancia, Iloilo province, at the height of the typhoon. \\n\\nDisasters may also have longer-term impacts. For example, natural disasters may cause long-term waste management difficulties or [[ecosystem]] damage.\\n\\n== Major international conferences ==\\nThe Environmental Emergencies Forum is a unique biennial international forum that brings together disaster managers and environmental experts from governments, [[UN]] agencies, industries, academies, NGOs and civil society to improve prevention, preparedness, response and overall resilience to environmental emergencies. It also provides guidance for the Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit, which provides a Secretariat to the meeting. The most recent meeting was held in Norway in June 2015. The next meeting will be held in Nairobi in June 2017.\\n\\n== Relevant organizations ==\\n\\n===United Nations===\\nThe Joint [http://www.unep.org/ United Nations Environment Programme] (UNEP)/[http://www.unocha.org/ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs] (OCHA) Environment Unit (JEU): By pairing the UNEP's technical expertise with OCHA's humanitarian response network, the Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit (JEU) mobilizes and coordinates a comprehensive response to environmental emergencies to protect lives, livelihoods, ecosystems and future generations. The JEU can be reached 24 hours/day, seven days/week, all year round and operates at the request of affected countries. The JEU can be called by member states when acute environmental risks to life and health as a result of conflicts, natural disasters and industrial accidents are suspected.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Environmental Emergency Response |url=https://www.unep.org/environmental-emergency-response |access-date=6 April  2024 |website=United Nations}}</ref> \\n\\nThe JEU hosts the Environmental Emergencies Centre ([http://www.eecentre.org/ www.eecentre.org]),  an online tool designed primarily to provide national responders with a one-stop-shop of all information relevant to the preparedness, prevention and response stages of an environmental emergency. \\nWebsite: [http://www.unocha/org/unep www.unocha/org/unep]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; [http://www.eecentre.org/ www.eecentre.org]\\n\\n== See also ==\\n*[[Disaster management]]\\n*[[Environmental crime]]\\n*[[Environmental disaster]]\\n*[[Natural disasters]]\\n*[[Risk management]]\\n*[[UNISDR]]\\n*[[Vulnerability]]\\n*[[World Conference on Disaster Reduction]]\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130329180231/http://unocha.org/what-we-do/coordination-tools/environmental-emergencies UN OCHA Environmental Emergencies Section]\\n* [http://www.eecentre.org Environmental Emergencies Centre]\\n* [http://www.gcint.org/green-star-awards Green Star Awards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210824212202/http://www.gcint.org/green-star-awards/ |date=2021-08-24 }} \\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070701161450/http://www.gadr.giees.uncc.edu/ Global Alliance for Disaster Reduction]\\n* [http://www.gdin.org/ Global Disaster Information Network]\\n* [http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep3/page/2628.aspx APELL] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030185050/http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep3/page/2628.aspx |date=2016-10-30 }}\\n* [http://www.unep.org/gc/gc22/Document/k0263253.pdf UNEP/GC.22/INF/5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113641/http://www.unep.org/gc/gc22/Document/k0263253.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}\\n\\n[[Category:Emergency management]]\\n[[Category:Humanitarian aid]]\\n[[Category:Natural disasters]]\\n[[Category:Environmental disasters]]
Authorities continue to ban or disperse most public demonstrations. Politicians and journalists critical of the government face violence and intimidation and are barred from equal access to the broadcast media. In addition, the judiciary remains weak and subject to political influence. Trafficking of women and children for sexual exploitation through networks protected or backed by police or government officials is rampant. The government continues to turn a blind eye to fraudulent confiscation of farmers’ land, illegal logging, and widespread plundering of natural resources.\\n\\nPolitician, particularly those speeching on abuse of power or corruption and democracy, were at risk of investigation by the police on charges of his political opinions.\\n\\n* In June, Batzandan Jalbasuren, the head of the Just Society Civic Movement was detained for 41 days in a pre-trial detention centre. He was sentenced to Capital punishment by a district court for organising the demonstrations against the Government. In addition, Enkhbayar Davaa, the coordinator of the Just Society Civic Movement, is wanted by the police because of the organising of demonstrations.
What is CGIF?\\n\\nThe CGIF was established in November 2010 to promote financial stability and to boost long-term investment in the ASEANa+3 region (the "Region"). CGIF will provide guarantees on local currency denominated bonds issued by corporations in the Region. Such guarantees will make it easier for corporations to issue local currency bonds with longer maturities. This will help reduce the currency and maturity mismatches that caused the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis and make the Region's financial system more resilient to volatile global capital flows and external shocks. \\n\\nWhat are the priorities of CGIF? What kind of activities may be guaranteed by the facility?\\n\\nThe aim of CGIF is to help companies that otherwise would have difficulty tapping local bond markets to secure longer-term financing, reduce their dependency on short-term foreign currency borrowing to mitigate currency and maturity mismatches. Increased issuances of local currency bonds will promote financial stability in the Region and aid the development of ASEAN's bond markets.\\n\\nWho are eligible for CGIF guarantees?\\n\\nCGIF will provide guarantees for local currency denominated bonds issued by investment grade corporations in the Region.\\n\\nWho supports the fund?\\n\\nCGIF has received capital contributions of $700 million from ASEAN, the People's Republic of China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and ADB.\\n\\na ASEAN member countries: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam.
I never find it easy to write about myself, particularly when this is being posted to an open access website like Wikipedia and when I am using my real name! My main interest at the moment is related to financial organisations, monetary policy and potential impacts of financial institutions (in the broad sense) on financial stability. In particular I am currently at Cambridge University getting engaged with some of the literature on pricing and value theory, econometrics of financial markets, monetary theories of production, international capital markets and heterodox economic theory, having chosen to take a career break and participate in a Masters of Philosophy taught by the Center of Development Studies. Within this context, I have a particular interest in the advantages and disadvantages of the process of globalization of financial systems for both developed and developing countries. As you can probably appreciate, much of what I have learnt has direct application to some of the financial crises of recent years and my hope in participating in Wikipedia is to contribute a 'pluralist' voice in the context of an apparent failure of mainstream theory to prevent or explain recent events in the global economy.
'''Patrick Shanahan:  artist-photographer'''\\n\\nPatrick Shanahan (born Manchester, England, 1955) is a British artist-photographer whose photographs investigate the contemporary cultural landscape, offering a seductive and unsettling re-imaging of modern urban environments.\\n\\nMaking full use of the scenographic, artificial aspects of large-scale photography, he produces topographic images that are close to the kinds of minimalism found in painting and sculpture. These largely unpopulated compositions are subjected to a pristine finish and treatment of light, colour and space that help to establish a tension between a real and constructed landscape - a landscape in which the distinction between reality and imagination seem to blur and we are left with a peculiar sense of spatial estrangement.\\n\\nShanahan works with a variety of medium and large-format cameras and shoots on colour negative film. The film is digitally scanned and then worked on in Photoshop. Large-scale chromogenic dye-coupler prints are produced in limited editions - see artist website for details.\\n\\nThe result is hyperreal and illusory images that transform the environs we may be used to seeing into something disturbing and strange - images that pose the artificial and natural in opposition to one another. We feel simultaneously connected to and spatially estranged from them and, in blurring the distinction between reality and imagination, his photographs alter the way we see and relate to the world.
Who invented Gunpowder? \\n\\nDuring the Tang Dynasty, around 850 A.D, an enterprising alchemist (whose name has been lost to history) mixed 75 parts saltpeter with 15 parts charcoal and 10 parts sulfur. This mixture had no discernible life-lengthening properties, but it did explode with a flash and a bang when exposed to an open flame. According to a text from that era, "smoke and flames result, so that [the alchemists'] hands and faces have been burnt, and even the whole house where they were working burned down."\\n\\nMany western history books over the years have stated that the Chinese used this discovery only for fireworks, but that is not true. Song Dynasty military forces as early as 904 A.D. used gunpowder devices against their primary enemy, the Mongols. These weapons included "flying fire" (fei huo), an arrow with a burning tube of gunpowder attached to the shaft. Flying fire arrows were miniature rockets, which propelled themselves into enemy ranks and inspired terror among both men and horses. It must have seemed like fearsome magic to the first warriors who were confronted with the power of gunpowder.
'''International trade and water''' is the relationship between international trade and the water being used by humans. The substantial increase in human population during the 20th century combined with rapid increases in overall global economic development has resulted in rising challenges for the future of public water management.  The developing world has been particularly impacted by the lack of access to clean water. Each year, millions of people die due to illnesses, diseases, and lack the capital to create the infrastructure necessary to combat the problem.<ref>(Segerfeldt 2005)</ref> These conditions have increased the global demand for clean water and in turn, have pressured free market economists to suggest that wealthy market players are the most efficient solution to addressing water issues.<ref>(Saefong 2006)</ref> Several nations can benefit from international trade in water. Particularly nations with excess fresh water and abundant capital are looking forward to making healthy profits from either the export of water to other nations, or are interested in the investment returns they will earn from participation in foreign markets. However, not everyone agrees that market forces are best capable of solving water issues. NGOs, human rights organizations, and various stakeholders oppose viewing water in economic terms. These individuals accuse international trade agreements and international economic institutions including the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) of attempting to privatize a resource that they consider a basic human right.<ref>(Overbeke 2004)</ref>  The lack of a common understanding of whether or not water should be viewed as a commodity or a basic human right has resulted in heated debates among legal professionals and leading members of the academia.\\n\\n==Water as a commodity==\\nPrior to the industrial period, water had been extracted by whichever local community lived around it. As the industrial period progressed however, this view began to be replaced by a more economic oriented approach. Today, most water goes through a complicated industrial process that begins with its extraction and ends in a complicated process involving pipes, dams, and other sorts of unnatural facilities. Even fresh water that is located in rivers and lakes must somehow be extracted.  In general these considerations involve the use of land, labor and capital thereby replacing the notion of a common resource into a value based product. [[Desalination]] and desalination plants also play a major role.\\n\\n==International institutions, international trade agreements and [[water privatization]]==\\nIn 2000, out of the 40 IMF loans distributed 12 had requirements of partial or full privatization of water supplies.iv Likewise 50 percent of World Bank loans issued in 2002 to developing countries contained a clause that requested privatization of water services.<ref>(Public Citizen.org 2002)</ref> In addition to international institutions pushing for privatization, trade agreements in the 20th century have also created the legal framework for allowing the sale of water. The GATS, known as the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]], operates on a list in approach, meaning it allows privatization in areas that the nation has agreed to open to other members. The [[Doha Development Round]] of negotiations aims at changing this stature. During these negotiations it was declared that no sector is to be excluded from the negotiations to the new agreement. If water services negotiations succeed then once a member chooses to open their markets to their own private sector, then will have to afford other members the same rights to invest in that sector.<ref>(Mann 2006)</ref> Many regional trade agreements do not have a list in approach and are therefore subject to the same conditions mentioned above. For example, in the US-CAFTA agreement only Costa Rica directly specified that water services were to be excluded from foreign investment the other nations made no similar request.<ref>(Mann 2006)</ref>  Due to the mixed results obtained from privatization of water services and the difficulty of reversing that decision, several actors have strongly opposed the export of bulk fresh water. These actors claim that once such an action is allowed to occur then it will establish a precedent of treating water just like any other export. This in turn will become legally binding and irreversible.\\n\\n==International trade and water legal disputes and politics==\\nCanada is one of the largest owners of fresh water and has for years been engaged in a legal dispute over its possession of the resource. In 1990 an American company named Sunbelt was invited by the government of British Columbia to invest in a water exporting operation. Due to setbacks, the contract never matured and Sunbelt sued the government of British Columbia for failing to meet its obligations. After years of battle the Canadian government declared in 1999 that water in its fresh state as those found in rivers and lakes contains no economic value, and is therefore outside the obligations of its trade agreement.<ref>(Dr. Isabel Al-Assar 2008)</ref> In addition, the government cited article XI of GATT (G). This article allows for the conservation of a natural resource as long as the action taken by the government is done in a non-discriminatory manner. Sunbelt however, disagreed with the applicability of this clause and claimed that Canada’s actions are in direct violation of several international trade agreements. Particularly, Sunbelt addressed Article XI of GATT which forbids a member nation from imposing measures other than taxes, levies and other charges on the export of its good. Likewise, Sunbelt argued that the water located in British Columbia belonged to US companies just as much as it belongs to Canadian companies. This argument is based on Article 11 of NAFTA known as the investment chapter. Once water is extracted from its natural state for whatever reason that same right must be given to foreign investors. Sunbelt argues that Canadian companies had such extractions in the past and therefore opened the door for foreign investors to come in and do likewise.\\n\\n==Turkey-Israel==\\nIn 2002, Israel agreed to buy 1.75 billion cubic feet of water from Turkey every year for a period of 20 years.<ref>(US Water News Online 2004)</ref> The method of transport involved the use of [[Spragg Bag|large plastic bubbles]] that would bring the water to the storage facility. In regards to the talks, the foreign minister of Turkey declared that  this agreement will increase the cooperation between the two countries and also lead to peace and stability in the Middle East.<ref>(US Water News Online 2004)</ref> Economically Israel concluded that the cost of importing water would be higher than choosing the desalinization option but chose to import anyway. In addition to hoping to achieve peace the foreign minister  also mentioned that the landmark agreement turns water into an internationally accepted ''commodity,'' and that Turkey hopes to sell water to other countries. Turkey canceled the deal after the Gaza Flotilla Raid by IDF commandos  [[Gaza flotilla raid|Gaza Flotilla Raid]] on May 31 2010. During this incident several Turkish nationals were killed by Israeli armed forces.<ref>[http://www.uswaternews.com/archives/arcglobal/4israsign3.html Israel signs agreement to buy water from Turkey]</ref>\\n\\n==UN declaration==\\nIn July 2010, the [[UN General Assembly]] declared that [[human right to water and sanitation|access to clean water and sanitation]] is a human right. The assembly did not specify whether a public authority or the private sector would be best capable of providing this right.\\n\\n==See also==\\n* [[Gaza blockade]]\\n* [[Shared vision planning]]\\n* [[Spragg Bag]]\\n* [[Water law]]\\n* [[Water privatization]]\\n* [[Water trading]]\\n* [[World Water Monitoring Day]]\\n\\n==Notes==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==References==\\ni (Segerfeldt 2005) \\n\\nii (Saefong 2006) \\n\\niii (Overbeke 2004) \\n\\niv (Shiva 2002) \\n\\nv (Public Citizen.org 2002) \\n\\nvi (Mann 2006) \\n\\nvii (Mann 2006) \\n\\nviii (Dr. Isabel Al-Assar 2008) \\n\\nix (US Water News Online 2004) \\n\\nx (US Water News Online 2004)\\n\\n[[Category:Hydrology]]\\n[[Category:Food politics]]\\n[[Category:Drinking water]]\\n[[Category:Water supply]]\\n[[Category:Water management]]\\n[[Category:Drinking water regulation]]\\n[[Category:Water management authorities]]\\n[[Category:Hydraulic engineering]]\\n[[Category:Water and politics]]\\n[[Category:Water conservation]]\\n[[Category:Environmental engineering]]\\n[[Category:Water resources management]]\\n[[Category:Water privatization]]
'''\\n== [['''''Christopher Columbus sighted the island of Jamaica during his second voyage, and it became a Spanish colony in 1509. Saint Jago de la Vega (now Spanish Town) was founded about 1523. Colonization was slow under Spanish rule. \\nJamaica was captured by an English naval force under Sir William Penn in 1655. The island was formally transferred to England in 1670. During the final decades of the 17th century, growing numbers of English immigrants arrived; the sugar, cacao, and other agricultural and forest industries were rapidly expanded; and the consequent demand for plantation labor led to large-scale importation of black slaves. Jamaica soon became one of the principal slave-trading centers in the world. But, by 1838, slavery was abolished by parliamentary legislation, and $30 million was granted as compensation to the owners of the nearly 310,000 liberated slaves.\\n\\n\\nLarge numbers of the freed blacks abandoned the plantations following emancipation and took possession of unoccupied lands in the interior, gravely disrupting the economy. Labor shortages, bankrupt plantations, and declining trade resulted in a protracted economic crisis.

{{User:Kpalion/Polish cuisine sidebox}}\\n\\nThe '''history of [[Polish cuisine]]''' has been shaped by such factors as the country's climate, a mostly agrarian lifestyle with parallel strains of rustic and luxurious culinary tradition, religious dietary requirements of the Catholic Church, external influences coming from various directions, as well as periods of scarcity and culinary monotony, notably during the Second World and Cold Wars. \\n\\nDue to Poland's location in a moderate temperate climate with frosty winters and a relatively short growing season, storage of food for several colder months, when fresh produce becomes largely unavailable, is a necessity. Before the advent of modern preservation techniques, such pasteurization and refrigeration, Poles relied on such traditional methods as salting-curing, pickling by lactic fermentation or acidification in vinegar, as well as smoking and drying. As a result, salty, sour and smoky flavors are typical of many Polish foods. Traditional Polish cooking is highly seasonal. ''Add examples of foods availably only during certain seasons.''\\n\\nThe official adoption of Western-rite Christianity in the 10th century CE meant that the natural seasonality has been compounded with the Roman Catholic liturgical calendar of alternating festive and fasting periods. Polish people still associate certain foods with specific religious holidays, such as Easter and Christmas. Many Poles fast every Friday, the day of the week associated with the crucifixion of Jesus, by refraining from eating land-animal meat and opting for fish instead.\\n\\nThroughout most of Poland's history, it was a predominantly agricultural country with a large portion of the population living off the fields and pastures which they tended themselves. An agrarian lifestyle with an emphasis on self-sufficience has played an important role in the shaping of Polish cuisine. Food production has always been supplemented with foraging and hunting in forests, enriching\\nthe Polish table with a variety of berries, mushrooms and game. An income gap, which grew in the early modern period between the peasants and petty nobility on the one hand and affluent grain-exporting magnates on the other, led to two separate strains in Polish culinary history – a simple rustic fare dominated by groats and flour-based foods, cabbage and root vegetables, as well as animal fats as a substitute for meat, versus lordly cuisine featuring choice meats, expensive sugar and exotic spices. The latter was played down under the Communist regime, but has been making a comeback in the 21st century and Polish cuisine draws from both currents today.\\n\\n* foreign influence: English, French, Italian, German, Czech, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Russian, Tatar, Jewish, Armenian, Turkish, etc.\\n* periods of scarcity: importance of culinary creativity\\n\\n{{TOC limit|3}}\\n\\n== Middle Ages ==\\n{{See also|Medieval cuisine|Regional cuisines of medieval Europe}}\\n[[File:Ur-painting.jpg|thumb|Copy of a 16th-century painting of an aurochs]]\\nInformation about Polish medieval cuisine is scant. No recipes from that period have been preserved, leaving historians to speculate on the subject of Polish medieval menus from archeological finds and such surviving documents as purchase orders for the royal pantry, compounded with analogies from other nations and more recent ethnographic sources.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|p=59}}{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=2–3}} In the [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|early centuries of Polish statehood]], i.e., roughly 10th–13th centuries, there was little differentation in terms of food consumption across social strata, as both poorer and wealthier families produced their own food. Subsistence farming was largely complemented with hunting, fishing, and foraging.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|pp=56–58}} \\n\\n[[Millet]] – originally [[foxtail millet]], but later replaced by [[proso millet]], better suited to the Polish climate – was the principal crop, typically consumed in the form of gruel or porridge and possibly flat breads.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|p=55}}{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=103–105}} Polish gardens provided various kinds of cabbage and [[kale]], legumes – such as [[flat bean]]s and [[lentil]]s – and root vegetables.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|p=55}}{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=125}} Peas and cabbage – fresh or pickled – were consumed all year round by all levels of the society.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=123–124}} Root vegetables included parsnips, [[Sium sisarum|skirrets]], carrots – then larger, whiter and more similar to the former – as well as beets, rutabagas, radishes, and turnips. The wife of [[Piast the Wheelwright]], a legendary peasant progenitor of Poland's first royal dynasty, was called [[Rzepicha|Rzepka]], or "Turnip", illustrating the vegetable's importance to early Poles of any station.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=126–129}} Some of the vegetables popularly consumed in this period – such as [[Fallopia convolvulus|black bindweed]],{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=11}} [[alexanders]], [[Chenopodium album|goosefoot]], [[Rumex scutatus|buckler sorrel]], and [[Lapsana|nipplewort]] – gradually disappeared from noble and then from peasant tables in later times. The [[Heracleum mantegazzianum|giant hogweed]], known in Polish as ''barszcz'', was used to make a soup to which it lent its name.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=126–129}} Additionally, apples, pears, plums, sweet and sour cherries, and hazelnuts were grown in the orchards.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=132}} \\n\\nAll social groups consumed fairly large amounts of meat, mostly pork. Pigs, resembling small wild boars, were grazed in oak and beech forests.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|p=56}} Cattle was raised mostly for draft and milk, so beef was a more expensive treat. Both of these kinds of meat, as well as poultry, were usually spit-roasted, but also stewed, boiled, barbecued or pickled in their own jelly.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=83–94}} The immense forests, which then covered most of the country, were a source of game, which served as an important addition to the meat of domestic animals. Poles commonly hunted the small game, such as hares, [[beaver]]s, [[badger]]s, [[Grey Partridge|partridges]], and [[black grouse]], and occasionally the big game, from [[roe deer]] to [[red deer]], elk ([[moose]]), wild boars, bears, [[European bison|wisent]], to [[aurochs]], the now-extinct ancestor of domestic cattle.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=84–85, 94–96}}\\n\\n* Seasonality, pickled vegetables, salted meat, ''rosół''\\n* [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church]].

Wyken Seagrave is passionate about using the history of the Universe to integrate a wide range of scientific, historical and social knowledge into a single unified story.\\n\\n“In a world facing many global problems, everyone can gain by understanding basic science, knowing where we came from and understanding the options facing us,” he says.\\n\\nWyken has been studying and writing about this subject for 40 years, both as an historical narrative and as fiction. His first book, Global Vision, was published in 1992 by Penny Press, a company dedicated to publishing on this subject, under the name Philip Brown. He converted the book to a website in 1998, and www.historyoftheuniverse.com now gets around 1 million visitors each year.\\n\\n“Seeing ourselves in a universal context is a salutary experience, giving us a new perspective on our current problems, many of which are on a global scale. To solve them will require global solutions. We all need to make important decisions about our ways of life. We need to understand what caused our problems and what options we have for solving them. We can only obtain this by taking a global perspective,” Wyken claims.\\n\\nHe began to write the story as a work of fiction in 2002, and published The Cosmic Monopole in 2011. This is the first volume of a sci-fi fantasy romance which will take the readers on a trip back through time to the Big Bang (and beyond) on an effort to save the Universe.

There is Emergence of internet and the development in ICT (Information Communications Technology), which affects every aspect of human life. Present rapid development in communication system and recent innovation in technology witnessed as changing emphasis in the role of information and management. The end users approach to meeting information needs is also rapidly getting transformed.  The new technologies have facilitated the transformation of data into digital formats. The availability and use of digital libraries is gradually becoming the norm for the provision of literature and information in all the fields and research. Digital Libraries are catering to information services interacting with online databases of journals and other resources Digital Library are important in creating, indexing and retrieving the various forms of digital resources.
== McJondalds ==\\n\\n\\n'''McJondalds''' is a sexually transmitted disease that usually begins by affecting use of the right side of women and the left side of men. \\n\\n\\n\\n== Stages ==\\nThere are several different stages of this disease, the first being crying or laughing uncontrollably, and repeated self-urination. The secondary stage includes a severe increase in appetite, irritability, and excessive exhaustion. The third and fatal stage occurs when the individual begins to consume large quantities of Iced Tea, dance uncontrollably, and be increasingly afraid of dark basements in their Grandmother's houses.\\n\\n== Causes==\\nMcJondalds can be contracted by sleeping in a small bed next to an infected individual. The chances of contracting McJondalds increases if the infected individual's hindquarters comes in close proximity to the other individual's hindquarters.\\nOther ways to contract McJondalds include: separation from a loved one for long periods of time, reversing day and night (staying up late/sleeping in late), consuming large amounts of frozen treats, spending large amounts of time on the internet and spying on family members.\\n\\n== History ==\\nMcJondalds is among the newest of sexually transmitted diseases. Current research shows that it is most common among cousins of the same age and also among chronic tea drinkers. Very little information is able to be located, on the account that very little is known.
==National Take Back Initiative==\\n\\nThe annual National Take Back Initiative in the United States occurs October 29.  This program is coordinated by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA).  Drug Take Back Programs are a common and environmentally < supportive venue for avoiding the improper disposal of unused pharmaceuticals.  \\n\\nIn 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, enough pharmaceuticals were prescribed to medicate every American adult around-the-clock for one month.   Some of these prescriptions and over the counter drugs decay in the home and are highly susceptible to diversion, misuse, and abuse.  Often, more Americans currently abuse prescription drugs than the number of those using cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, and inhalants combined, according to the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Studies show that the majority of teens who abuse prescription drugs obtain them from family or friends for free, including from the home medicine cabinet.  Improper disposal methods can pose both safety and environmental hazards.\\n\\nFour days following the DEA’s first Take-Back Day on September 25, 2010, Congress approved legislation that amended the [[Controlled Substances Act]].  This action provided the DEA with the option to develop a permanent process for people to safely and conveniently dispose of their prescription drugs. After October 12,President Obama signed the Safe and Secure Drug Disposal Act of 2010, and the DEA immediately began installing regulations for a more permanent solution.\\n\\nThe DEA’s Take-Back events are also a reflection of the President's prescription drug abuse prevention strategy entitled [[Epidemic: \\nResponding to America’s Prescription Drug Abuse Crisis]] developed and promoted by the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]]. Ridding medicine cabinets of unused or expired medications in American homes is one of the four main items addressed the strategy for reducing diversion prescription drug abuse. The other action items include educating the public as well as health care providers. In turn, this system establishes prescription drug monitoring programs in all the states.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}
The goal of '''American influence operations in Russia''' is to force Russia into supporting American foreign policy interests and diminish Russia's potential to act as a geopolitical rival to the United States. The methods used include attempts to organise regime change in Russia, followed by installation of a new government that would be friendly towards the United States and support all its policies. Destroying Russia's capability to act as a geopolitical rival is the aim of the neoconservative agenda, according to which America should try to prevent to rise of future rivals "by all means necessary".\\n\\n== Support for NGOs and political parties ==\\nFunding of agenda-based NGOs and support for political parties.

The season for BBQ’s is just around the corner and as expected, there has been an increase in demand for outdoor electric grills. Long gone are the days where people use to burn coal to enjoy a good BBQ. Many researches showed that burning coal to cook BBQ food is known to be quite harmful as it emits carbon gases which get stored in the food that is being cooked; seeing as we consume that food, it is known to cause a lot of problems in the human body.

'''Mobile Adhoc Network: Routing Protocols \\nMANET'''\\n\\nAn ad hoc network is a collection of mobile nodes using wireless network interfaces to communicate among themselves without using the existing network infrastructure or centralized administration. In the areas where there is little or no infrastructure is available or the existing wireless infrastructure is expensive and inconvenient to use, Mobile Ad hoc Networks, called MANETs, are becoming useful. A mobile ad hoc network is a set of mobile nodes able to communicate with other nodes in their surroundings. These wireless communications happen in a peer-to-peer manner instead of static(fixed) network infrastructure, dynamically forming a temporary network to exchange information without using any pre-existing fixed network infrastructure. They are going to become integral part of next generation mobile services. A MANET consists of mobile platforms (e.g., a router with multiple hosts and wireless communications devices) herein simply referred to as "nodes", which are free to move about randomly. The nodes may be located in or on airplanes, ships, trucks, cars, perhaps even on very small devices, and there may be multiple hosts per router. The network topology in a MANET usually changes with time thus nodes are free to move arbitrarily.
== Motobolosm ==\\n\\nAn autoimmune disorder affecting African tribesmen. The total number of affected men is undetermined due to poor data gathering in the third world. It is theorized that the disease originates as a liver enzyme deficiency but and in turn results in the immune system attacking vital bodily systems such as the liver, pancreas, lungs/respiratory and some suspect it may also be responsible for heart failures. The disease only affects men in third world countries and seems to be only life threatening in those with the darkest of skins. The blackest of the blackies.
== Rape Trees ==\\n\\n\\n\\nOver the past several decades, crimes against women and children, crossing the U.S mexican border have risen.   It is estimated that the Border Patrol receives reports on about three to four rapes a day of illegal immigrants along the 2,000-mile border- or 1,040 to 1,460 a year” (TAASA; June 5, 2006) These women pay men, called "coyotes", to transport them into the United States with promises of jobs and security once they cross the border.  In an horrifying turn of events,the perpatrators are documenting their crimes by creating 'rape trees'.   ‘Rape trees’ are used as trophies,visual reminders that let other criminals know how many women were raped at the site. They hang their underwear on trees along the border as a symbol of power over the helpless immigrants.The practice first started along the border and now occurs in the Unided States.  California, Texas and Arizona,for example, are three states where ‘rape trees’ are appearing. Many of these victims remain unknown and are never given the life they were promised.\\n\\nTo view our blog, click on the link below:\\n\\n[http://www.PreventRapeTrees.Blogspot.com]
'''Aphthoviruses'''\\n\\nFoot-and-mouth disease (FMD), sometimes called hoof-and-mouth disease, is a highly contagious viral disease of cattle and pigs.  It can also infect deer, goats, sheep, and other animals with cloven hooves, as well as elephants, rats, and hedgehogs.  Horses are not susceptible to FMD.  The cause of FMD was first shown to be viral in 1897 by Friedrich Loeffler.  He passed the blood of an infected animal through a fine porcelain-glass filter and found that the fluid that was collected could still cause the disease in healthy animals.  FMD occurs throughout much of the world, including parts of Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America.  While currently (July 2001) some countries, including Canada, the United States, and Australia, have been relatively free of FMD for some time, its wide host range and rapid spread represent cause for international concern.\\n\\nIn cattle, foot-and-mouth disease is characterized by high fever that declines rapidly after two or three days; blisters inside the mouth that lead to excessive secretion of stringy or foamy saliva and to drooling; and blisters on the feet that may rupture and cause lameness.  Adult animals may suffer weight loss from which they do not recover for several months, and in cows, milk production can decline significantly.  Though most animals eventually recover from FMD, the disease can lead to ''myocarditis'' (inflammation of the heart muscle) and death, especially in newborn animals.  Some infected animals remain asymptomatic, that is, they do not suffer from or show signs of the disease; but they are ''carriers'' of FMD and can transmit it to others.\\n\\nInfection with foot-and-mouth disease tends to occur locally, that is, the virus is passed on to susceptible animals through direct contact with infected animals or with contaminated pens or vehicles used to transport livestock.  The clothes and skin of animal handlers such as farmers, standing water, and uncooked food scraps and feed supplements containing infected animal products can harbor the virus as well.  Cows can also catch FMD from the semen of infected bulls.  Control measures include quarantine and destruction of infected livestock, and export bans for meat and other animal products to countries not infected with the disease.\\n\\nFoot-and-mouth disease is caused by an ''Aphthovirus'' [ap-thoh"-vei'-r&s]  of the viral family ''Picornaviridae''. [pi-kawr'-n&-vir"-id-ei]  The members of this family are small (25-30 nm), nonenveloped icosahedral [ei-koh<nowiki>''</nowiki>-s&-hee'-dr&l]  viruses that contain single-stranded ''RNA'' (''ribonucleid acid'', the viral genetic material).  When such a virus comes in contact with a host cell, it binds to a receptor site and triggers a folding-in of the cell membrane.  Once the virus is inside the host cell, its protein coat dissolves.  New viral RNA and components of the protein coat are then synthesized in large quantities and assembled to form new viruses.  After assembly, the host cell ''lyses'' (bursts) and releases the new viruses.\\n\\nHumans can be infected with foot-and-mouth disease through contact with infected animals, but this is extremely rare.  Because the virus that causes FMD is sensitive to stomach acid, it cannot spread to humans via consumption of infected meat.  In the UK, the last confirmed human case occurred in 1967, and only a few other cases have been recorded in countries of continental Europe, Africa, and South America.  Symptoms of FMD in humans include malaise, fever, vomiting, red ulcerative lesions (surface-eroding damaged spots) of the oral tissues, and sometimes vesicular lesions (small blisters) of the skin.  There is another viral disease with similar symptoms, commonly referred to as “hand, foot, and mouth disease,” that occurs more frequently in humans, especially in young children; this disease is caused by a different virus of the family Picornaviridae, namely, an ''Enterovirus'' called ''Coxsackie A''.  Because FMD rarely infects humans but spreads rapidly among animals, it is a much greater threat to the agriculture industry than to human health.  Farmers around the world can lose billions of dollars a year during a foot-and-mouth epidemic, when large numbers of animals are destroyed and revenues from milk and meat production go down. \\n\\n=== For Further Reading ===\\nLevy, Jay A., Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat, and Robert A.

The Taiwan music and art scene has been flourishing in recent years. The influx of foreign artists to the country have given rise to a diverse culture of Taiwanese and non Taiwanese alike working together. This cohesion has made Taiwan a breeding ground for new, diverse, cutting edge, art and music. With the reach of the internet, art and music lovers from almost any country can now appreciate the talent emerging from this small Pacific Island nation.\\nTaiwan has it's share of political strife. And reflected in trials and tribulations of any society comes music, art and literature.\\n\\nMilitant Hippi, a musical band of artists that hail from different parts of the globe, has burst on the Taiwan culture scene. With them they have brought music, video art and political messages for the masses.\\n\\nThe Militant Hippi agenda is to keep the masses aware though music, art, humor and literature. Their music is a blended fusion of reggae, hip hop, classical, jazz and good ol' rock N roll.
Trait theory is a major approach to the study of human personality. Trait theorists are primarily interested in the measurement of traits, which can be defined as habitual patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion.[1] According to this perspective, traits are relatively stable over time, differ among individuals (e.g. some people are outgoing whereas others are shy), and influence behavior.\\n\\nGordon Allport was an early pioneer in the study of traits, which he sometimes referred to as dispositions. In his approach, central traits are basic to an individual's personality, whereas secondary traits are more peripheral. Common traits are those recognized within a culture and may vary between cultures. Cardinal traits are those by which an individual may be strongly recognized. Since Allport's time, trait theorists have focused more on group statistics than on single individuals. Allport called these two emphases "nomothetic" and "idiographic," respectively.\\n\\nThere is a nearly unlimited number of potential traits that could be used to describe personality. The statistical technique of factor analysis, however, has demonstrated that particular clusters of traits reliably correlate together. Hans Eysenck has suggested that personality is reducible to three major traits.[2] [3] Other researchers argue that more factors are needed to adequately describe human personality.[4] Many psychologists currently believe that five factors are sufficient.[5] [6]\\n\\nVirtually all trait models, and even ancient Greek philosophy, include extraversion vs. introversion as a central dimension of human personality. Another prominent trait that is found in nearly all models is Neuroticism, or emotional instability.
9. The three major rock families are listed and described in the following. Igneous rock is formed by the cooling and consolidation of magma. Sedimentary rock is formed either by chemical precipitation of material carried in solution in sea, lake, or river water, or by the disposition of mineral particles transported in suspension by water, wind, or ice. Metamorphic rock is either igneous or sedimentary rock that has been changed as a result of high temperatures, high pressures, or both.\\n\\n12. Regolith is when rock is exposed at Earth's surface, it is susceptible to alteration by the action of water, wind, and other agents that may act to alter the composition of the minerals present or to break the rock apart. Three types are as followed. The surface blanket is the broken-up material that constitutes the regolith; forms a blanketing lair draped over most of Earth's surface. Sediment is a type on which the unconsolidated rock and mineral particles that constitute the regolith are collectively referred to as sediment. Soil is the last type that is a special type of regolith, which contains the organic matter mixed with the mineral component. \\n\\n14. Soil is derived from the decay of dead plants and animals. Living plants are nourished by the nutrients released from decaying organisms, as well as by the nutrients released during weathering. \\n\\npg. 218\\n\\n1. The rock cycle involves the cycling of material through the geosphere as a result of the formation, breakdown, rearrangement, and reformation of rock. The rock cycle comprises the processes whereby materials within and on top of the Earth's crust are weathered, transported, deposited, deformed, altered, melted. and reformed into new rock. \\n\\n3.
{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n"Sahel Calling" is a documentary film about the role of musicians in the humanitarian crisis in Mali and the Sahel. It is not just a film, but also a communication tool to raise awareness and encourage action to re-unite Mali, to stop the violation of human rights in the north of Mali, and to demand comprehensive relief aide for people affected by the rebel insurgences and the food and water shortage in the Sahel. Appealing to a global audience to stand in solidarity with these musicians and their messages, the film also emphasizes the urgent need for North and West Africans to come together to bring peace and unity in Mali and throughout the Sahel.\\n\\nSynopsis:\\nOften in Africa, musicians say what the politicans will not, and what the oppressed cannot. Whether international celebrities or local stars, the North and West African musicians of "Sahel Calling" tell us the story of strife and struggle in Mali and the Sahel. Of course, each musician has their own story, each rhythm its own history. The film honors this as it accompanies these musicians on a musical caravan through Mauritania, Mali and Burkina Faso.\\n\\nThe caravan is part of worldwide "Festival in Exile" which pays tribute to the Festival au Désert, a musical and cultural festival usually taking place in the north of Mali, now occupied by fundamentalist Islamic groups who ban the very creation and enjoyment of music. "Sahel Calling" questions the power of musicians in this time of humanitarian crisis, especially in light of the political, social, ethnic and religious complexities of Mali and the Sahel.

It's also significant as one of the earliest manifestations of organized, automated software piracy, a precursor to the BitTorrents and P2P networks of today. There was no media coverage because the "public" internet was in its infancy, the media did not fully understand it, and even AOL didn't realize the scope of the problem on its hands. (Evidenced by the years-long effort to shut the scene down, glacial by today's standards and security practices.) When you consider the media's lack of fluency in internet matters even today, it becomes clear why there are no "official sources." But harping on the fact that there was no media coverage does nothing to deny the basic fact that this era (and scene) did exist and was highly significant for thousands of users of the most popular ISP of the 1990s. Lastly, it seems odd that an editor would be so dead-set on deleting the only article on Wikipedia on this particular subject.
CYBER LAW & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\\nSuccess in any field of human activity leads to crime that needs mechanisms to control it.\\nLegal provisions should provide assurance to users, empowerment to law enforcement\\nagencies and deterrence to criminals. The law is as stringent as its enforcement. Crime is no\\nlonger limited to space, time or a group of people. Cyber space creates moral, civil and\\ncriminal wrongs. It has now given a new way to express criminal tendencies. Back in 1990,\\nless than 100,000 people were able to log on to the Internet worldwide. Now around 500\\nmillion people are hooked up to surf the net around the globe.\\nUntil recently, many information technology (IT) professionals lacked awareness of and\\ninterest in the cyber crime phenomenon. In many cases, law enforcement officers have\\nlacked the tools needed to tackle the problem; old laws didn’t quite fit the crimes being\\ncommitted, new laws hadn’t quite caught up to the reality of what was happening, and there\\nwere few court precedents to look to for guidance. Furthermore, debates over privacy issues\\nhampered the ability of enforcement agents to gather the evidence needed to prosecute these\\nnew cases. Finally, there was a certain amount of antipathy—or at the least, distrust—\\nbetween the two most important players in any effective fight against cyber crime: law\\nenforcement agencies and computer professionals. Yet close cooperation between the two\\nis crucial if we are to control the cyber crime problem and make the Internet a safe “place”\\nfor its users.\\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law|Law]] enforcement personnel understand the criminal mindset and know the basics of\\ngathering evidence and bringing offenders to justice. IT personnel understand computers\\nand networks, how they work, and how to track down information on them. Each has half of\\nthe key to defeating the cyber criminal.\\nIT professionals need good definitions of cybercrime in order to know when (and what) to\\nreport to police, but law enforcement agencies must have statutory definitions of specific\\ncrimes in order to charge a criminal with an offense. The first step in specifically defining\\nindividual cybercrimes is to sort all the acts that can be considered cybercrimes into\\norganized categories.United Nations’ Definition of Cybercrime\\nCybercrime spans not only state but national boundaries as well. Perhaps we should look to\\ninternational organizations to provide a standard definition of the crime. At the Tenth\\nUnited Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of Offenders, in a\\nworkshop devoted to the issues of crimes related to computer networks, cybercrime was\\nbroken into two categories and defined thus:\\na. Cybercrime in a narrow sense (computer crime): Any illegal behavior directed by means\\nof electronic operations that targets the security of computer systems and the data processed\\nby them.\\nb. Cybercrime in a broader sense (computer-related crime): Any illegal behavior committed\\nby means of, or in relation to, a computer system or network, including such crimes as\\nillegal possession [and] offering or distributing information by means of a computer system\\nor network.\\nOf course, these definitions are complicated by the fact that an act may be illegal in one\\nnation but not in another.\\nThere are more concrete examples, including\\ni. Unauthorized access\\nii Damage to computer data or programs\\niii Computer sabotage\\niv Unauthorized interception of communications\\nv Computer espionage\\nThese definitions, although not completely definitive, do give us a good starting point—one\\nthat has some international recognition and agreement—for determining just what we mean\\nby the term cybercrime.\\nIn Indian law, cyber crime has to be voluntary and willful, an act or omission that adversely\\naffects a person or property. The IT Act provides the backbone for e-commerce and India’s\\napproach has been to look at e-governance and e-commerce primarily from the promotional\\naspects looking at the vast opportunities and the need to sensitize the population to the\\n2possibilities of the information age. There is the need to take in to consideration the security\\naspects.\\nIn the present global situation where cyber control mechanisms are important we need to\\npush cyber laws. Cyber Crimes are a new class of crimes to India rapidly expanding due to\\nextensive use of internet. Getting the right lead and making the right interpretation are very\\nimportant in solving a cyber crime. The 7 stage continuum of a criminal case starts from\\nperpetration to registration to reporting, investigation, prosecution, adjudication and\\nexecution. The system can not be stronger than the weakest link in the chain. In India, there\\nare 30 million policemen to train apart from 12,000 strong Judiciary. Police in India are\\ntrying to become cyber crime savvy and hiring people who are trained in the area. Each\\npolice station in Delhi will have a computer soon which will be connected to the Head\\nQuarter.. The pace of the investigations however can be faster; judicial sensitivity and\\nknowledge need to improve. Focus needs to be on educating the police and district\\njudiciary. IT Institutions can also play a role in this area.\\nTechnology nuances are important in a spam infested environment where privacy can be\\ncompromised and individuals can be subjected to become a victim unsuspectingly. We need\\nto sensitize our investigators and judges to the nuances of the system. Most cyber criminals\\nhave a counter part in the real world. If loss of property or persons is caused the criminal is\\npunishable under the IPC also. Since the law enforcement agencies find it is easier to handle\\nit under the IPC, IT Act cases are not getting reported and when reported are not necessarily\\ndealt with under the IT Act. A lengthy and intensive process of learning is required.\\nA whole series of initiatives of cyber forensics were undertaken and cyber law procedures\\nresulted out of it. This is an area where learning takes place every day as we are all\\nbeginners in this area. We are looking for solutions faster than the problems can get\\ninvented. We need to move faster than the criminals.\\nThe real issue is how to prevent cyber crime. For this, there is need to raise the probability\\nof apprehension and conviction. India has a law on evidence that considers admissibility,\\nauthenticity, accuracy, and completeness to convince the judiciary. The challenge in cyber\\ncrime cases includes getting evidence that will stand scrutiny in a foreign court.\\n3For this India needs total international cooperation with specialised agencies of different\\ncountries. Police has to ensure that they have seized exactly what was there at the scene of\\ncrime, is the same that has been analysed and the report presented in court is based on this\\nevidence. It has to maintain the chain of custody. The threat is not from the intelligence of\\ncriminals but from our ignorance and the will to fight it. The law is stricter now on\\nproducing evidence especially where electronic documents are concerned.\\nThe computer is the target and the tool for the perpetration of crime. It is used for the\\ncommunication of the criminal activity such as the injection of a virus/worm which can\\ncrash entire networks. \\nThe [[Information_Technology_Act,_2000|Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000]], specifies the acts which have been made\\npunishable. Since the primary objective of this Act is to create an enabling environment for\\ncommercial use of I.T., certain omissions and commissions of criminals while using\\ncomputers have not been included. With the legal recognition of Electronic Records and the\\namendments made in the several sections of the IPC vide the IT Act, 2000, several offences\\nhaving bearing on cyber-arena are also registered under the appropriate sections of the IPC.\\nDuring the year 2003, 60 cases were registered under IT Act as compared to 70 cases during\\nthe previous year thereby reporting a decline of 14.3 percent in 2003 over 2002. Of the total\\n60 cases registered under IT Act 2000, around 33 percent (20 cases) relate to Obscene\\nPublication / Transmission in electronic form, normally known as cases of cyber\\npornography. 17 persons were arrested for committing such offences during 2003.\\nThere were 21 cases of Hacking of computer systems wherein 18 persons were arrested in\\n2003. Of the total (21) Hacking cases, the cases relating to Loss/Damage of computer\\nresource/utility under Sec 66(1) of the IT Act were to the tune of 62 percent (13 cases) and\\nthat related to Hacking under Section 66(2) of IT Act were 38 percent (8cases). \\nDuring 2003, a total of 411 cases were registered under IPC Sections as compared to 738\\nsuch cases during 2002 thereby reporting a significant decline of 44 percent in 2003 over\\n2002. Andhra Pradesh reported more than half of such cases (218 out of 411) (53 percent). \\n4Of the 411 cases registered under IPC, majority of the crimes fall under 3 categories viz.\\nCriminal Breach of Trust or Fraud (269), Forgery (89) and [[Counterfeiting]] (53). \\nThough, these offences fall under the traditional IPC crimes, the cases had the cyber tones\\nwherein computer, Internet or its related aspects were present in the crime and hence they\\nwere categorised as Cyber Crimes under IPC. \\nDuring 2003, number of cases under Cyber Crimes relating to Counterfeiting of\\ncurrency/Stamps stood at 53 wherein 118 persons were arrested during 2003. Of the 47,478\\ncases reported under Cheating, the Cyber Forgery (89) accounted for 0.2 per cent. Of the\\ntotal Criminal Breach of Trust cases (13,432), the Cyber frauds (269) accounted for 2\\npercent. Of the Counterfeiting offences (2,055), Cyber Counterfeiting (53) offences\\naccounted for 2.6 percent.\\nA total of 475 persons were arrested in the country for Cyber Crimes under IPC during\\n2003. Of these, 53.6 percent offenders (255) were taken into custody for offences under\\nCriminal Breach of Trust/Fraud (Cyber) and 21.4 percent (102) for offences under ‘Cyber\\nForgery’.\\nThe age-wise profile of the arrested persons showed that 45 percent were in the age-group\\nof 30-45 years, 28.5 percent of the offenders were in the age-group of 45-60 years and 11\\noffenders were aged 60 years and above. Gujarat reported 2 offenders who were below 18\\nyears of age. \\nFraud/Illegal gain (120) accounted for 60 per cent of the total Cyber Crime motives reported\\nin the country. Greed/Money (15 cases) accounted for 7.5 percent of the Cyber Crimes\\nreported. Eve-teasing and Harassment (8 cases) accounted for around 4 per cent. Cyber\\nSuspects include Neighbours / Friends / Relatives (91), Disgrunted employees (11),\\nBusiness Competitors (9), Crackers Students / Professional learners (3). \\nCybercrime is not on the decline. The latest statistics show that cybercrime is actually on the\\nrise. However, it is true that in India, cybercrime is not reported too much about.\\nConsequently there is a false sense of complacency that cybercrime does not exist and that\\n5society is safe from cybercrime. This is not the correct picture. The fact is that people in our\\ncountry do not report cybercrimes for many reasons. Many do not want to face harassment\\nby the police. There is also the fear of bad publicity in the media, which could hurt their\\nreputation and standing in society. Also, it becomes extremely difficult to convince the\\npolice to register any cybercrime, because of lack of orientation and awareness about\\ncybercrimes and their registration and handling by the police. \\nA recent survey indicates that for every 500 cybercrime incidents that take place, only 50\\nare reported to the police and out of that only one is actually registered. These figures\\nindicate how difficult it is to convince the police to register a cybercrime. The establishment\\nof cybercrime cells in different parts of the country was expected to boost cybercrime\\nreporting and prosecution. However, these cells haven’t quite kept up with expectations.\\nNetizens should not be under the impression that cybercrime is vanishing and they must\\nrealize that with each passing day, cyberspace becomes a more dangerous place to be in,\\nwhere criminals roam freely to execute their criminals intentions encouraged by the socalled anonymity that internet provides.\\nThe absolutely poor rate of cyber crime conviction in the country has also not helped the\\ncause of regulating cybercrime. There has only been few cybercrime convictions in the\\nwhole country, which can be counted on fingers. We need to ensure that we have\\nspecialized procedures for prosecution of cybercrime cases so as to tackle them on a priority\\nbasis,. This is necessary so as to win the faith of the people in the ability of the system to\\ntackle cybercrime. We must ensure that our system provides for stringent punishment of\\ncybercrimes and cyber criminals so that the same acts as a deterrent for others. \\nThreat Perceptions\\nUK has the largest number of infected computers in the world followed by the US and\\nChina. Financial attacks are 16 events per 1000, the highest among all kinds of attacks. The\\nUS is the leading source country for attacks but this has declined. China is second and\\nGermany is third. It is hard to determine where the attack came from originally.\\nThe number of viruses and worm variants rose sharply to 7,360 that is a 64% increase over\\nthe previous reporting period and a 332% increase over the previous year. There are 17,500\\nvariants of Win.32 viruses. Threats to confidential information are on the rise with 54% of\\n6the top 50 reporting malicious code with the potential to expose such information. Phishing\\nmessages grew to 4.5 million from 1 million between July and December 2004.\\nSome Indian Case Studies\\n1. Pune Citibank MphasiS Call Center Fraud\\nUS $ 3,50,000 from accounts of four US customers were dishonestly transferred to bogus\\naccounts. This will give a lot of ammunition to those lobbying against outsourcing in US.\\nSuch cases happen all over the world but when it happens in India it is a serious matter and\\nwe can not ignore it. It is a case of sourcing engineering. Some employees gained the\\nconfidence of the customer and obtained their PIN numbers to commit fraud. They got these\\nunder the guise of helping the customers out of difficult situations. Highest security prevails\\nin the call centers in India as they know that they will lose their business. There was not as\\nmuch of breach of security but of sourcing engineering.\\nThe call center employees are checked when they go in and out so they can not copy down\\nnumbers and therefore they could not have noted these down. They must have remembered\\nthese numbers, gone out immediately to a cyber café and accessed the Citibank accounts of\\nthe customers.\\nAll accounts were opened in Pune and the customers complained that the money from their\\naccounts was transferred to Pune accounts and that’s how the criminals were traced. Police\\nhas been able to prove the honesty of the call center and has frozen the accounts where the\\nmoney was transferred.\\nThere is need for a strict background check of the call center executives. However, best of\\nbackground checks can not eliminate the bad elements from coming in and breaching\\nsecurity. We must still ensure such checks when a person is hired. There is need for a\\nnational ID and a national data base where a name can be referred to. In this case\\npreliminary investigations do not reveal that the criminals had any crime history. Customer\\neducation is very important so customers do not get taken for a ride. Most banks are guilt of\\nnot doing this. \\n2. Bazee.com case\\n7CEO of Bazee.com was arrested in December 2004 because a CD with objectionable\\nmaterial was being sold on the website. The CD was also being sold in the markets in Delhi.\\nThe Mumbai city police and the Delhi Police got into action. The CEO was later released on\\nbail. This opened up the question as to what kind of distinction do we draw between Internet\\nService Provider and Content Provider. The burden rests on the accused that he was the\\nService Provider and not the Content Provider. It also raises a lot of issues regarding how\\nthe police should handle the cyber crime cases and a lot of education is required.\\n3. State of Tamil Nadu Vs Suhas Katti \\nThe Case of Suhas Katti is notable for the fact that the conviction was achieved successfully\\nwithin a relatively quick time of 7 months from the filing of the FIR. Considering that\\nsimilar cases have been pending in other states for a much longer time, the efficient\\nhandling of the case which happened to be the first case of the Chennai Cyber Crime Cell\\ngoing to trial deserves a special mention.\\nThe case related to posting of obscene, defamatory and annoying message about a divorcee\\nwoman in the yahoo message group. E-Mails were also forwarded to the victim for\\ninformation by the accused through a false e-mail account opened by him in the name of the\\nvictim. The posting of the message resulted in annoying phone calls to the lady in the belief\\nthat she was soliciting.\\nBased on a complaint made by the victim in February 2004, the Police traced the accused to\\nMumbai and arrested him within the next few days. The accused was a known family friend\\nof the victim and was reportedly interested in marrying her. She however married another\\nperson. This marriage later ended in divorce and the accused started contacting her once\\nagain. On her reluctance to marry him, the accused took up the harassment through the\\nInternet. \\nOn 24-3-2004 Charge Sheet was filed u/s 67 of IT Act 2000, 469 and 509 IPC before The\\nHon’ble Addl. CMM Egmore by citing 18 witnesses and 34 documents and material objects.\\nThe same was taken on file in C.C.NO.4680/2004. On the prosecution side 12 witnesses\\nwere examined and entire documents were marked as Exhibits.\\n8The Defence argued that the offending mails would have been given either by ex-husband\\nof the complainant or the complainant her self to implicate the accused as accused alleged to\\nhave turned down the request of the complainant to marry her. \\nFurther the Defence counsel argued that some of the documentary evidence was not\\nsustainable under Section 65 B of the Indian Evidence Act. However, the court relied upon\\nthe expert witnesses and other evidence produced before it, including the witnesses of the\\nCyber Cafe owners and came to the conclusion that the crime was conclusively proved.\\nLd. Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, delivered the judgement on 5-11-04\\nas follows:\\n“ The accused is found guilty of offences under section 469, 509 IPC and 67 of IT Act\\n2000 and the accused is convicted and is sentenced for the offence to undergo RI for 2\\nyears under 469 IPC and to pay fine of Rs.500/-and for the offence u/s 509 IPC\\nsentenced to undergo 1 year Simple imprisonment and to pay fine of Rs.500/- and for\\nthe offence u/s 67 of IT Act 2000 to undergo RI for 2 years and to pay fine of\\nRs.4000/- All sentences to run concurrently.”\\nThe accused paid fine amount and he was lodged at Central Prison, Chennai. This is\\nconsidered as the first case convicted under section 67 of Information Technology Act 2000\\nin India. \\n4. The Bank NSP Case\\nThe Bank NSP case is the one where a management trainee of the bank was engaged to be\\nmarried. The couple exchanged many emails using the company computers. After some\\ntime the two broke up and the girl created fraudulent email ids such as\\n“indianbarassociations” and sent emails to the boy’s foreign clients. She used the banks\\ncomputer to do this. The boy’s company lost a large number of clients and took the bank to\\ncourt. The bank was held liable for the emails sent using the bank’s system.\\n5. SMC Pneumatics (India) Pvt. Ltd. v. Jogesh Kwatra\\n9In India’s first case of cyber defamation, a Court of Delhi assumed jurisdiction over a matter\\nwhere a corporate’s reputation was being defamed through emails and passed an important\\nex-parte injunction. \\nIn this case, the defendant Jogesh Kwatra being an employ of the plaintiff company started\\nsending derogatory, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, filthy and abusive emails to his employers\\nas also to different subsidiaries of the said company all over the world with the aim to\\ndefame the company and its Managing Director Mr. R K Malhotra. The plaintiff filed a suit\\nfor permanent injunction restraining the defendant from doing his illegal acts of sending\\nderogatory emails to the plaintiff.\\nOn behalf of the plaintiffs it was contended that the emails sent by the defendant were\\ndistinctly obscene, vulgar, abusive, intimidating, humiliating and defamatory in nature.\\nCounsel further argued that the aim of sending the said emails was to malign the high\\nreputation of the plaintiffs all over India and the world. He further contended that the acts of\\nthe defendant in sending the emails had resulted in invasion of legal rights of the plaintiffs.\\nFurther the defendant is under a duty not to send the aforesaid emails. It is pertinent to note\\nthat after the plaintiff company discovered the said employ could be indulging in the matter\\nof sending abusive emails, the plaintiff terminated the services of the defendant. \\nAfter hearing detailed arguments of Counsel for Plaintiff, Hon’ble Judge of the Delhi High\\nCourt passed an ex-parte ad interim injunction observing that a prima facie case had been\\nmade out by the plaintiff. Consequently, the Delhi High Court restrained the defendant from\\nsending derogatory, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, humiliating and abusive emails either to\\nthe plaintiffs or to its sister subsidiaries all over the world including their Managing\\nDirectors and their Sales and Marketing departments. Further, Hon’ble Judge also restrained\\nthe defendant from publishing, transmitting or causing to be published any information in\\nthe actual world as also in cyberspace which is derogatory or defamatory or abusive of the\\nplaintiffs.\\n10This order of Delhi High Court assumes tremendous significance as this is for the first time\\nthat an Indian Court assumes jurisdiction in a matter concerning cyber defamation and\\ngrants an ex-parte injunction restraining the defendant from defaming the plaintiffs by\\nsending derogatory, defamatory, abusive and obscene emails either to the plaintiffs or their\\nsubsidiaries.\\n6. PARLIAMENT ATTACK CASE\\nBureau of Police Research and Development at Hyderabad had handled some of the top\\ncyber cases, including analysing and retrieving information from the laptop recovered from\\nterrorist, who attacked Parliament. The laptop which was seized from the two terrorists,\\nwho were gunned down when Parliament was under siege on December 13 2001, was sent\\nto Computer Forensics Division of BPRD after computer experts at Delhi failed to trace\\nmuch out of its contents. \\nThe laptop contained several evidences that confirmed of the two terrorists’ motives,\\nnamely the sticker of the Ministry of Home that they had made on the laptop and pasted on\\ntheir ambassador car to gain entry into Parliament House and the the fake ID card that one\\nof the two terrorists was carrying with a Government of India emblem and seal.\\nThe emblems (of the three lions) were carefully scanned and the seal was also craftly made\\nalong with residential address of Jammu and Kashmir. But careful detection proved that it\\nwas all forged and made on the laptop.\\n7. Andhra Pradesh Tax Case\\nDubious tactics of a prominent businessman from Andhra Pradesh was exposed after\\nofficials of the department got hold of computers used by the accused person.\\nThe owner of a plastics firm was arrested and Rs 22 crore cash was recovered from his\\nhouse by sleuths of the Vigilance Department. They sought an explanation from him\\nregarding the unaccounted cash within 10 days.\\n11The accused person submitted 6,000 vouchers to prove the legitimacy of trade and thought\\nhis offence would go undetected but after careful scrutiny of vouchers and contents of his\\ncomputers it revealed that all of them were made after the raids were conducted. \\nIt later revealed that the accused was running five businesses under the guise of one\\ncompany and used fake and computerised vouchers to show sales records and save tax.\\n8. SONY.SAMBANDH.COM CASE\\nIndia saw its first cybercrime conviction recently. It all began after a complaint was filed by\\nSony India Private Ltd, which runs a website called www.sony-sambandh.com, targeting\\nNon Resident Indians. The website enables NRIs to send Sony products to their friends and\\nrelatives in India after they pay for it online. \\nThe company undertakes to deliver the products to the concerned recipients. In May 2002,\\nsomeone logged onto the website under the identity of Barbara Campa and ordered a Sony\\nColour Television set and a cordless head phone. \\nShe gave her credit card number for payment and requested that the products be delivered to\\nArif Azim in Noida. The payment was duly cleared by the credit card agency and the\\ntransaction processed. After following the relevant procedures of due diligence and\\nchecking, the company delivered the items to Arif Azim. \\nAt the time of delivery, the company took digital photographs showing the delivery being\\naccepted by Arif Azim.\\nThe transaction closed at that, but after one and a half months the credit card agency\\ninformed the company that this was an unauthorized transaction as the real owner had\\ndenied having made the purchase. \\nThe company lodged a complaint for online cheating at the Central Bureau of Investigation\\nwhich registered a case under Section 418, 419 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code. \\nThe matter was investigated into and Arif Azim was arrested. Investigations revealed that\\nArif Azim, while working at a call centre in Noida gained access to the credit card number\\nof an American national which he misused on the company’s site. \\n12The CBI recovered the colour television and the cordless head phone.\\nIn this matter, the CBI had evidence to prove their case and so the accused admitted his\\nguilt. The court convicted Arif Azim under Section 418, 419 and 420 of the Indian Penal\\nCode — this being the first time that a cybercrime has been convicted. \\nThe court, however, felt that as the accused was a young boy of 24 years and a first-time\\nconvict, a lenient view needed to be taken. The court therefore released the accused on\\nprobation for one year.\\nThe judgment is of immense significance for the entire nation. Besides being the first\\nconviction in a cybercrime matter, it has shown that the the Indian Penal Code can be\\neffectively applied to certain categories of cyber crimes which are not covered under the\\nInformation Technology Act 2000. Secondly, a judgment of this sort sends out a clear\\nmessage to all that the law cannot be taken for a ride. \\n9. Nasscom vs. Ajay Sood & Others\\nIn a landmark judgment in the case of National Association of Software and Service\\nCompanies vs Ajay Sood & Others, delivered in March, ‘05, the Delhi High Court declared\\n`[[phishing]]’ on the internet to be an illegal act, entailing an injunction and recovery of\\ndamages.\\nElaborating on the concept of ‘phishing’, in order to lay down a precedent in India, the court\\nstated that it is a form of internet fraud where a person pretends to be a legitimate\\nassociation, such as a bank or an insurance company in order to extract personal data from a\\ncustomer such as access codes, passwords, etc. Personal data so collected by\\nmisrepresenting the identity of the legitimate party is commonly used for the collecting\\nparty’s advantage. court also stated, by way of an example, that typical phishing scams\\ninvolve persons who pretend to represent online banks and siphon cash from e-banking\\naccounts after conning consumers into handing over confidential banking details.\\nThe Delhi HC stated that even though there is no specific legislation in India to penalise\\nphishing, it held phishing to be an illegal act by defining it under Indian law as “a\\n13misrepresentation made in the course of trade leading to confusion as to the source and\\norigin of the e-mail causing immense harm not only to the consumer but even to the person\\nwhose name, identity or password is misused.” The court held the act of phishing as passing\\noff and tarnishing the plaintiff’s image.\\nThe plaintiff in this case was the National Association of Software and Service Companies\\n(Nasscom), India’s premier software association. \\nThe defendants were operating a placement agency involved in head-hunting and\\nrecruitment. In order to obtain personal data, which they could use for purposes of headhunting, the defendants composed and sent e-mails to third parties in the name of Nasscom.\\nThe high court recognised the trademark rights of the plaintiff and passed an ex-parte adinterim injunction restraining the defendants from using the trade name or any other name\\ndeceptively similar to Nasscom. The court further restrained the defendants from holding\\nthemselves out as being associates or a part of Nasscom.\\nThe court appointed a commission to conduct a search at the defendants’ premises. Two\\nhard disks of the computers from which the fraudulent e-mails were sent by the defendants\\nto various parties were taken into custody by the local commissioner appointed by the court.\\nThe offending e-mails were then downloaded from the hard disks and presented as evidence\\nin court. \\nDuring the progress of the case, it became clear that the defendants in whose names the\\noffending e-mails were sent were fictitious identities created by an employee on defendants’\\ninstructions, to avoid recognition and legal action. On discovery of this fraudulent act, the\\nfictitious names were deleted from the array of parties as defendants in the case.\\nSubsequently, the defendants admitted their illegal acts and the parties settled the matter\\nthrough the recording of a compromise in the suit proceedings. According to the terms of\\ncompromise, the defendants agreed to pay a sum of Rs1.6 million to the plaintiff as\\ndamages for violation of the plaintiff’s trademark rights. The court also ordered the hard\\ndisks seized from the defendants’ premises to be handed over to the plaintiff who would be\\nthe owner of the hard disks. \\n14This case achieves clear milestones: It brings the act of “phishing” into the ambit of Indian\\nlaws even in the absence of specific legislation; It clears the misconception that there is no\\n“damages culture” in India for violation of IP rights; This case reaffirms IP owners’ faith in\\nthe Indian judicial system’s ability and willingness to protect intangible property rights and\\nsend a strong message to IP owners that they can do business in India without sacrificing\\ntheir IP rights.\\n10. Infinity e-Search BPO Case \\nThe Gurgaon BPO fraud has created an embarrassing situation for Infinity e-Search, the\\ncompany in which Mr Karan Bahree was employed.\\nA British newspaper had reported that one of its undercover reporters had purchased\\npersonal information of 1,000 British customers from an Indian call-center employee.\\nHowever, the employee of Infinity eSearch, a New Delhi-based web designing company,\\nwho was reportedly involved in the case has denied any wrongdoing. The company has also\\nsaid that it had nothing to do with the incident.\\nIn the instant case the journalist used an intermediary, offered a job, requested for a\\npresentation on a CD and later claimed that the CD contained some confidential data. The\\nfact that the CD contained such data is itself not substantiated by the journalist.\\nIn this sort of a situation we can only say that the journalist has used “Bribery” to induce a\\n“Out of normal behavior” of an employee. This is not observation of a fact but creating a\\nfactual incident by intervention. Investigation is still on in this matter.
     TUKUTANE is an indigenous, non-governmental and not for profit humanitarian organization incepted in 2012 by Tanzanian volunteers who committed to promote a proactive strategy of poverty alleviation, aimed at supporting women and children, and keeping families intact.\\n\\n     Women bear almost all responsibility for meeting needs of the family, yet they are systematically denied from all resources, information and freedom of action they need to full fill this responsibility. The majority of country's poor populations are women; two-thirds of the Tanzanians' illiterates are females, and studies also show that, HIV/AIDS is rapidily becoming a woman's disease. In Tanzania, three-quarters of all young people living with HIV are women.\\n\\n     From the thousands of school age children who are deprived from going to school, the majority of them are girls. The current country food price crisis is having a severe impact on women and children. In our country, thousands of people eat two or three times a day, but a significant percentage of women and children eat only once. In fact many women skip their one time meal to ensure that their children are fed. These women are already suffering the effects of even more severe malnutrition, which inevitably will be their children's fate as well. The impact of this crisis is clearly visible on the children. They are often abandoned by their suffering mothers.

     TUKUTANE is an indigenous, non-governmental and not for profit humanitarian organization incepted in 2012 by Tanzanian volunteers who committed to promote a proactive strategy of poverty alleviation, aimed at supporting women and children, and keeping families intact.\\n\\n     Women bear almost all responsibility for meeting needs of the family, yet they are systematically denied from all resources, information and freedom of action they need to full fill this responsibility. The majority of country's poor populations are women; two-thirds of the Tanzanians' illiterates are females, and studies also show that, HIV/AIDS is rapidily becoming a woman's disease. In Tanzania, three-quarters of all young people living with HIV are women.\\n\\n     From the thousands of school age children who are deprived from going to school, the majority of them are girls. The current country food price crisis is having a severe impact on women and children. In our country, thousands of people eat two or three times a day, but a significant percentage of women and children eat only once. In fact many women skip their one time meal to ensure that their children are fed. These women are already suffering the effects of even more severe malnutrition, which inevitably will be their children's fate as well. The impact of this crisis is clearly visible on the children. They are often abandoned by their suffering mothers. If not abandoned they are abused and exploited.\\n\\n     Studies have shown that when women are supported and empowered then the who society gets benefited.

To import alcoholic beverages into the United States the general rule is that one must possess both the appropriate State and Federal beverage alcohol licenses.  (Unless the distinction is important, the works "permit" and "license" will be used interchangably)  \\n\\nFor licensing, labeling and tax purposes, alcoholic beverages are catagorized as wine, malt beverage (ie:  beer, ale) or distilled spirits.\\n\\nFederal law requires that one obtain a "basic permit" to import the appropriate type of alcohol for commercial purposes.  \\n\\nFederal law and regulations also require each container of beverage alcohol be labeled with a standard health warning statement in any case where the alcohol may be sold or "distributed".  The term "distributed" is interpreted broadly and is not restricted to sales or commercial transactions.  (27 CFR Part 16.)  Note that the law and regulations provide for a civil penalty of $11,000 per violation.\\n\\nTo import alcoholic beverages without a permit, the importer must qualify for an exception to the general rule.

Media Studies\\n\\n We have all grown up in environments saturated with media experiences. The media are familiar and one of our first aims will be to make them strange - to allow you to distance yourself from something you know, in order to look at it differently. This familiarity, and the expectations it arouses, also creates problems for a Media Studies textbook. TV, from children's programs through educational TV, to the vast range of broadcast material has probably taught you a great deal, in ways which books cannot hope to emulate. You may also have quite sophisticated experience of computers, at home and at college, including interactive forms like CD-ROMS and the internet. Modern technologies have dazzling capacities. It is now possible, using digital imaging, to make it seem as though Marilyn Monroe and Brad Pitt are playing a scene together or that Earth can morph into an apple before our eyes; to broadcast such scenes and simultaneously \\nacross continents; and to accompany them with music created entirely by computer. The internet has been touted, like many earlier technologies, everything is readily available and all questions can be answered.
\\n== '''South China Learning Institute''' ==\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South China Learning Institute (SCLI) was established by an organization of American and European professionals who have lived and worked throughout China for many years. The creation of the Institute was a response to what they saw as a need for greater learning and exchange between China and other nations and the immense opportunities that China now offers. They decided to locate the Institute in Shenzhen, a city with 10 million people, in response to the dynamism and extreme growth that has defined the Pearl River Delta region for the past 20 years.\\n\\n\\nSCLI accepts participants from all backgrounds seeking a deeply productive China learning experience, be it in language or otherwise.\\n\\n\\nSCLI offers Intensive Mandarin Language courses, featuring classroom study, exchange, and a wide selection of unique cultural and educational electives. Additionally, SCLI offers programs involving internship placements with major international companies in Shenzhen.\\n\\n\\nSCLI provides all participants with lodging, travel support, and many exciting travel excursions around China. SCLI offers a variety of packages built to accommodate all levels of Mandarin skills, interests, and time frames. For lodging, students have the option to choose between a home stay program with a Chinese family, or a more communal setting with peers in downtown Shenzhen.
== '''Global Initiative for Essential and Emergency Surgical Care''' ==\\n\\n\\n\\n'''The Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care''' (GIEESC)was established by the World Health Organization in December 2005.  Its general purpose is to reduce “death and disability from road traffic accidents, trauma, burns, falls, pregnancy related complications, domestic violence, disasters and other emergency surgical conditions” by improving collaborations between relevant organizations, institutions, and agencies.  Specific objectives include improving basic medical supplies at district hospitals, as well as better training for staff to bolster medical standards and care.\\n\\n== Establishment of GIEESC ==\\nThe GIEESC is a partnership of organizations, NGO’s, institutions, and associations from third and first world countries.  This partnership will work together in creating solutions and meeting the Millennium Development Goals developed by the WHO—which include reducing maternal and child mortality rates, as well as reducing HIV rates—“through improvement in the quality and safety of clinical procedures (essential surgical and anaesthesia care).”\\n===Mission statement===\\nThe GIEESC's goals are: to improve the already existing training and education programs necessary to execute emergency and essential surgical care; to develop district hospitals’ surgical, obstetric, trauma, and anesthesia service; to train personnel with the appropriate strategies to treat patients; to continue education to maintain skills; and to develop a dependable system that facilitates access to medication and medicinal drugs.\\n===Challenges===\\nChallenges include: poor equipment to “perform simple but vital interventions such as resuscitation, the provision of oxygen, assessment of anemia, suctions, intercostal drainage and airway support,”  inadequate basic supplies, absence of specialized surgical teams and lack of anesthesia.
A general definition of an ecological crisis the occurrences when the environment of species or a population changes in a way that destabilizes its continued survival. The main cause of the ecological crisis are human induced activities or anthropocentric acts like mining, pollution, deforestations, construction etcetera, for the global economy to grow.\\nThe solutions to the contemporary ecological crisis is sustainable development. Sustainable development is a type of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, not only for anthropocentric reasons but nature holistically. The concept of sustainable will be successful when the current population stabilize for natural resources to be evenly distributed’ for developed countries like the United States not to consume products that they do not need but they can rather make it accessible to countries who need those resources. \\nThe lifestyle as humans that we all should adopt is a culture of living in an environmentally friendly way. Like reusing, afforestation, and adopting traditions that have certain laws to use the environment sufficiently. The ideas of Saint Francis should be implemented because humans tend to have an idea that they are not part of nature or rather superior than nature which is not the case. \\nThe reason why human beings cause environmental degradation is because of the capitalistic regime. Humans in the ancient stages of life lived sustainably were they were part of nature. Nowadays humans maximize the use of natural resources to maximize their profits. That is why nature is exploited, it is a tool to produce and gain a lot of profit which will impact negatively now and in future.\\nHumans now have the obligation to make amends to the natural environment. Already climatic activities have been altered because of the human induced factors now it is up to humans to be part of nature. Humans need to be ethical about the actions that they act on.

A nuclear bomb is a weapon that uses a chemical reaction to release huge amounts of energy in explosive form.{}\\n	Since nuclear weapons were created in the late 1940s, they have been the most destructive manmade weapon on earth. Most modern nuclear bombs weigh around 2400 lb. but can equal the explosive force of millions of tons of TNT.  There are currently thousands of nukes but most of them fall into one of two categories; atomic and thermonuclear. The atomic bomb uses nuclear fission to power its explosion. The thermonuclear uses nuclear fission as well as nuclear fusion to fuel a much larger explosion. Another type of nuclear bomb is the multi-stage thermonuclear bomb, which the range of the explosion is too dangerous to serve purpose or even test. Either way all nuclear weapons use uranium or plutonium to power the blast.{}\\n	The intense range and damage of the nuclear bomb is all due to how it works.  The nuclear bomb obtains this power from a process that can be accurately compared to the domino effect. The process begins when a uranium (or plutonium) atom comes in contact with a neutron; the uranium then splits in two. The two uranium atoms continue to collide with other neutron atoms and splitting over and over again. This process repeats its’ self until there is so much split uranium atoms that the bombs casing bursts. This is called the “splitting the atom” method.{}\\n	The idea of splitting the atom began in 1939 when Albert Einstein wrote a letter to president Roosevelt that the
Microwave transmission refers to the technology of transmitting information or energy by the use of radio waves whose wavelengths are conveniently measured in small numbers of centimeters; these are called microwaves. This part of the radio spectrum ranges across frequencies of roughly 1.0 gigahertz (GHz) to 30 GHz. These correspond to wavelengths from 30 centimeters down to 1.0 cm.\\nMicrowaves are widely used for point-to-point communications because their small wavelength allows conveniently-sized antennas to direct them in narrow beams, which can be pointed directly at the receiving antenna. This allows nearby microwave equipment to use the same frequencies without interfering with each other, as lower frequency radio waves do. Another advantage is that the high frequency of microwaves gives the microwave band a very large information-carrying capacity; the microwave band has a bandwidth 30 times that of all the rest of the radio spectrum below it. A disadvantage is that microwaves are limited to line of sight propagation; they cannot pass around hills or mountains as lower frequency radio waves can.\\nMicrowave radio transmission is commonly used in point-to-point communication systems on the surface of the Earth, in satellite communications, and in deep space radio communications. Other parts of the microwave radio band are used for radars, radio navigation systems, sensor systems, and radio astronomy.\\nThe next higher part of the radio electromagnetic spectrum, where the frequencies are above 30 GHz and below 100 GHz, are called "millimeter waves" because their wavelengths are conveniently measured in millimeters, and their wavelengths range from 10 mm down to 3.0 mm. Radio waves in this band are usually strongly attenuated by the Earthly atmosphere and particles contained in it, especially during wet weather. Also, in wide band of frequencies around 60 GHz, the radio waves are strongly attenuated by molecular oxygen in the atmosphere. The electronic technologies needed in the millimeter wave band are also much more difficult to utilize than those of the microwave band.
Deficitis\\n\\n  Deficitis is a devastating disease where an organ eating parasite called Numotoma eats away at the internal organs until the host dies. The first warning sign of Deficitis is coughing. An infected individual may also suffer from vomiting, diarrhea, uncontrollable bowels, and in the worst cases neck spasms. It is mainly contracted from the common house cat. In order to avoid this disease, your cat must be sprayed with Windex at least 2 times a day. It is the only known chemical able to break down the virus. The Isopropanal found in Windex is what breaks down the genetic structure of Numotoma. Not much is known about Deficitis or the Numotoma parasite associated with it.

An addictive personality refers to a particular set of personality traits that make an individual predisposed to addictions. Addictions are characterized by a physical or psychological dependency that negatively impacts the quality of life of the person. They are frequently connected with substance abuse, but people with addictive personalities are also highly at risk of becoming addicted to gambling, food, exercise, work, and even relationships (codependency) ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). People engaged in addictive behavior tend to plan their lives around it ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). Scientists have been able to better understand addictive personalities as researchers delve further into understanding the chemistry of addiction. Alan R. Lang of Florida State University and author of an addiction study prepared for the National Academy of Sciences said, “If we can better identify the personality factors, they can help us devise better treatment and can open up new strategies to intervene and break the patterns of addiction” (Nelson). \\n\\n==Description==\\nAddictive personality disorder can be defined as a psychological setback that makes people more susceptible to addiction.  This can include anything from drug and alcohol abuse to pornography, gambling, videogames, food, exercise, work and even relations with others.  Experts describe the spectrum of behaviors designated as addictive in terms of five interrelated concepts which include patterns, habits, compulsions, impulse control disorders, and physical addiction ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). An individual is considered to be at the risk of developing such addictions when he/she displays signs of impulsive behavior, nonconformity combined with a weak commitment to the goals for achievement valued by the society, a sense of social alienation, and a sense of heightened stress (Nelson). Such a person may switch from one addiction to another other or even sustain multiple addictions at different times (Mason).\\n\\n==Signs and Symptoms==\\nThe people suffering from addictive personality disorder are currently defined to have a “brain disease” as promoted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and other authorities (Addictive Behaviors 3). People with addictive personalities are very much sensitive to stress. They have trouble handling situations that they deem frustrating, even if the event is for a very short duration. They often lack self-esteem and will show impulsive behavior such as excessive caffeine consumption, eating of chocolates or other sugar laden foods, television watching, or even running (Nelson).\\n\\nMood swings and antisocial behavior are other visible traits of people that suffer from addictive personality disorder. They may turn down invitation to social gatherings in order to alienate themselves from their respective societies.  The main reason behind such behavior is that they are fearful of being caught with this disorder.  The feeling of isolation will often have negative effects on the people that facing the issue, and so to substitute for the lack of personal relationships, they turn towards drugs, smoking, alcohol consumption, or the like.  They usually will believe that such harmful substances serve as “quick-fix" solutions for their life's problems ("Addiction/Addictive Personality").\\n\\nPeople suffering from APD find it difficult to manage their stress levels. In fact, lack of stress tolerance is a telltale sign of the disorder. They find it difficult to face stressful situations and fight hard to get out of such conditions (Mason).\\n\\nLong term goals prove difficult to achieve because people with APD usually focus on the stress that comes with getting through the short term goals.  Such personalities will often switch to other enjoyable activities the moment that they are deprived of enjoyment in their previous addiction.\\n\\nAddictive individuals feel highly insecure when it comes to relationships. They may often find it difficult to make commitments in relationships or trust their beloved because of the difficulty they find in achieving long term goals. They constantly seek approval of others and as a result, and these misunderstandings may contribute to the destruction of relationships.  People suffering from addictive personality disorder usually undergo depression and anxiety, managing their emotions by developing addiction to drugs, alcohol or other pleasurable activities (Nelson).\\n\\n\\n==Common Forms of Addictive Behavior==\\nSubstance abuse and dependence is one of the most common displays of addictive personalities. Alcohol is the most frequently abused psychoactive substance and affects over 20 million Americans—13 percent of the adult population ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). Aside from alcohol, other psychoactive drugs commonly abused include barbiturates, narcotics, stimulants, anti-anxiety drugs, and psychedelics and hallucinogens ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). While drug abuse and dependence can happen to anyone, it is significantly more likely to occur in the presence of an addictive personality. \\n\\nAnother common addiction that may attract those with addictive personalities is gambling. When an addict behaves mindlessly and irresponsibly while gambling, it can grow to be a bigger problem. There are said to be three stages a gambler with an addictive personality goes through (Eng). The first is the “winning phase” in which the person can still control his or her own behavior. Second comes the “losing phase” where the individual starts to gamble alone, borrowing cash and gambling large sums of money compiling debt which he or she may not be able to pay off. Finally, the “desperation phase” of the addictive behavior gambler is when the person takes further risks, may engage in illegal loans and activities and even experience depression or attempt suicide (Eng). \\n\\nAddictive personality behaviors even include eating disorders, such as anorexia, bulimia and compulsive overeating. Those with anorexia nervosa are not content with his or her physical image, and in turn constantly starve him or herself in order to feel beautiful. Once a person starts dieting, it is very difficult for him or her to quit. This is similarly true for those suffering from bulimia. A person is said to have bulimia when he or she binges on large amounts of food and then prevents absorption by purging (laxatives, vomiting, water pills, etc) (Eng). With compulsive eating, the person has a compulsive urge or craving to eat and will eat even when not hungry. This addictive behavior often results in obesity. \\n\\nThree increasingly more common displays of addictive personalities include work and exercise. Our society rewards those who work hard. But work may become an obsession if family, friends, interests and hobbies have suddenly become unimportant. Likewise, an extreme commitment to exercise that can sometimes lead to self destructive and harmful behavior is an example of addictive behavior. \\n\\n==Treatment==\\nAddictive personalities and the subsequent addictions are difficult to treat. Addictive behavior often involves long term psychological ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). Physical addictions even alter an individual’s brain chemistry making the road to recovery longer and more difficult. Often the person with a physical addiction cannot be exposed to the addictive habit without lapsing back into addiction. This is why rates of being “cured” are often closely followed by setbacks. The first step in the recovery process of addictive behaviors is to admit that there is a problem and seek help. Medical intervention may be necessary for those who engage in substance abuse—medication is often used to treat withdrawal symptoms and treat for malnutrition. Many forms of psychological intervention are also available to those with addictive personalities including counseling and inpatient programs, group therapy, environmental intervention and behavior therapy ("Addiction/Addictive Personality").\\n\\n==References==\\n* "Addiction/Addictive Personality."

Re:  Water Fluoridation Controversy\\n\\nI read Wikipedia's piece Water Fluoridation Controversy, and I browsed a few individual comments concerning the write-up on this topic. Overall I was disappointed, as I found this piece to be very slanted to a pro-fluoridation status quo. I was especially disappointed with the section citing water fluoridation in courts of law, as there was NO MENTIONING of three landmark cases in Illinois, Texas, and Pennsylvania where in two cases water fluoridation was judged as posing a hazard to public health, and in the Illinois case the judge ruled that the Illinois legislature's mandatory fluoridation law was at odds with the scientific evidence, i.e., that fluoridation of water has not been shown to be both safe and effective. The notion that there has been no critical adjudications on water fluoridation is absolutely an outright deception. The fact that these three landmark cases were omitted demonstrates clearly the author's pro-fluoridation bias.\\n\\nWikipedia, you should be able to do better than this.
I am trained in biochemistry at a liberal arts college.  My first and only fluent language is English, although I've taken a major interest in Spanish and also Greek, Latin and maybe even French.  I am also interested in food, music, health, math, computers, physics, systems and informatics, and business and money.  I have never been intrinsically interested in social studies including the broad areas of politics and sociology; I do however try to make concerted efforts to learn within these areas.\\n\\nOn the topic of Wikipedia, I believe this is a powerful and invaluable resource for the world.  I do acknowledge the concerns -- aired mostly by academics -- that open editing compromises the potential accuracy of Wikipedia articles.

As a physicist and chemical engineer, my scientific loyalties sometimes conflict with my spiritual loyalties.   As a philosopher, seeking eternal, universal truths, my discoveries are being chronicled in a book which I call, True Freedom, which finds much resonance with Ayn Rand's Objectivism and Individualism.\\n\\nTrue Freedom requires individual equality, lest one person or group infringe upon the freedoms of others.  Therefore privacy establishes impartiality and fairness.  Privacy protects individuals from inequality by restricting the ability to discern and thus segregate individuals or groups by any particular characteristic.  Security requires that every person be uniquely, positively, and easily identified so that trust may abound and privacy may be most fully preserved.  True Democracy extends equality by allowing every citizen an equal voice in matters of governance (that there may be no masters or tyrants).
Shower science: scientific research or empirical study to discover laws governing the operation and practical use of any showering system being domestic, commercial, military, aerospace, hybrid or other.\\n\\nThe advent of "hybrid showering systems" is rather new. Powerful consumption made possible by a highly automated destruction of vast quantities of hydrocarbons from the Earth, have in a sense over a short time developed a "blind spot" that camouflages the heinous waste of thermal energy, water, and consumables like soap that the contemporary but still extremely primitive bathroom shower system requires to operate.\\n\\nIt was found that only one energy saving hybrid showering system could save energy than a small town where all the lights were on only.\\n\\nThe practical laws that govern "extreme waste" in contemporary showers was first discovered by Michael Vittorio Collalto who in the period during 1986 and particularly from 1994 onwards set about materializing what has become this worlds first "hybrid showering system".\\n\\nIt gradually incorporated a research facility, used to test the hypothesis amongst others that the shower seemed to be no better than an efficient "cooling tower", amazingly adverse to the aim of providing a warm or hot environment.\\n\\nIt mimics the operation of a cooling tower in almost every respect.\\n\\nThe similarities are staggering.\\n\\n(used to cool water in order to improve the efficiency of the refrigeration cycle in larger applications. e.g. commercial buildings.)\\n\\nA technology specifically to remove thermal potential from water efficiently. \\n\\nA further observation has persisted, that according to this discovery, although it might seem desirable to recover heat at the drain from the showering process and others like in the kitchen sink, most of the thermal potential in typical primitive showering systems is removed well before the water reaches the drain where any substantially meaningful recovery can occur.
A large proportion of homes include traditional radiators for heating, which over the years, have been mainly left uncovered, but due to growing demand and the awareness caused by exposure on TV shows, radiator cabinets have changed from an upmarket fashion accessory to an essential item in the home. Providing effective protection against coming into contact with hot surfaces is important for all members of the family, especially the young and elderly. Adding covers eliminates the likelihood of this occurring whilst creating attractive room features throughout the home. An ever increasing selection of cabinets in a variety of styles and finishes is available nationwide in standard sizes to cover the majority of UK radiators and adjustable versions are also available. These are designed to fit a number of different sized radiators by adjusting in width to provide a custom made look. With special made to measure services ensuring non-standard radiators can also be covered, homeowners will welcome the safety and aesthetic benefits of adding radiator cabinet.

\\nJet streams are fast flowing, narrow air currents found in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth. The main jet streams are located near the tropopause, the transition between the troposphere (where temperature decreases with altitude) and the stratosphere (where temperature increases with altitude).[1] The major jet streams on Earth are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a meandering shape; jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including the opposite direction of most of the jet. The strongest jet streams are the Polar jets, at around 7–12 km (23,000–39,000 ft) above sea level, and the higher and somewhat weaker Subtropical jets at around 10–16 km (33,000–52,000 ft). The Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere each have both a polar jet and a subtropical jet. The northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia and their intervening oceans, while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica all year round.\\nJet streams are caused by a combination of a planet's rotation on its axis and atmospheric heating (by solar radiation and, on some planets other than Earth, internal heat). Jet streams form near boundaries of adjacent air masses with significant differences in temperature, such as the polar region and the warmer air towards the equator.[2]\\nMeteorologists use the location of some of the jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting. The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against the flow of a jet stream. Clear-air turbulence, a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety, often is found in a jet stream's vicinity. One future benefit of jet streams could be to power airborne wind turbines.\\nOther jet streams also exist. During the northern hemisphere summer, easterly jets can form in tropical regions, typically in a region where dry air encounters more humid air at high altitudes. Low-level jets also are typical of various regions such as the central United States. \\nA narrow current of strong wind circling the Earth from west to east at altitudes of about 11 to 13 km (7 to 8 mi) above sea level. There are usually four distinct jet streams, two each in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Jet stream wind speeds average 56 km (34 mi) per hour in the summer and 120 km (74 mi) in the winter. They are caused by significant differences in the temperatures of adjacent air masses. These differences occur where cold, polar air meets warmer, equatorial air, especially in the latitudes of the westerlies.
{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n'''Sewerthermal'''\\nThe Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago coined the term "Sewerthermal" in May 2012 to explain a new heating and cooling system that harnesses energy from effluent water (treated wastewater). The MWRD expects this new energy source to supply the Kirie Water Reclamation Plant in Des Plaines, Illinois, with up to 40 percent of its heating and cooling energy needs. This plan could provide a model for heating and cooling energy needs at other MWRD facilities and for other facilities around the world. The sewerthermal system takes advantage of relatively constant high temperatures of effluent water and uses only 20 percent or less power than what is needed for a traditional, direct heating system. Rather than extracting heat from the ground as is common for geothermal systems, the MWRD’s system is designed to extract heat from the effluent water, which holds a steady minimum temperature of 55 degrees Fahrenheit.\\n[[Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago]]
The purpose of the article in progress, "Celtic Music and American Identity", is to understand how layers of American Identity have been construed based on an influx of Celtic music. The article intends to inform on the diaspora of Celtic music to America in the 19th and 20th centuries and its effect on cultural and ideological aspects such as musical fusion (Celtic Rock, Celtic Punk, Celtic Pop, etc.) and social elements (i.e. tattoo art, festivals, pubs) that are now distinctly American. \\n\\nThis article is written based on guidelines and for fulfillment of the course 'Music in International Relations' at Denison University, Spring 2012. The course focuses on various topics in International Studies in relation to music, such as peace concerts, concert aesthetics, and the relationship between musical and social harmonies. Studies in History and Religion has inspired the topic of this article, in addition to an immersion in Scottish and Celtic culture.
The French Revolution was a true revolution due to the fact that it follows many of the steps necessary to be called a revolution.  One step that should be mentioned is that the public was willing to use violence in order to protect the Third Estate.   This is significant due to the fact that the Third Estate is able to make the changes to the government that people want.  This is shown in the Storming of Bastille where revolutionists broke into the fortress in order to seize gunpowder and weapons.  In Addition, this act convinced King Louis XVI to withdraw his troops from Paris.   Withdrawing his troops showed that he was intimidated by the people, a major step in a revolution.  This also shows the weakness of the French government, which makes the people confident in a revolution.  This step leads to many different steps needed to revolutionize a country. ~tony's
Human Service is a seperate academic discipline from social work and more information is needed to explain the differences between the two fields.\\n\\n\\nHuman services is the study of social technologies (models and methods of practice) and service technologies (programs and systems) that work at the micro-, mezzo-, and macro-levels of society.\\n\\nThe mission of human services is to advance autonomy of service users, to help build social capital and civic engagement, to make informal or formal human service systems more egalitarian, efficient and effective, and to advocate for positive social change at all levels of society by any means necessary.  \\n\\nThe academic discipline of human services takes a multidisciplinary approach and focuses on practical solutions to complex social welfare problems of the whole person, community, and the global society.
Power Electronics Education E-Book\\n\\nwww.peeeb.com\\n\\nDr. Firuz Zare\\n\\n'Globalization' is a simple way of describing the spread of communication and technologies across the world. As the store of knowledge expands throughout the world, all of the world’s people should have as much access as possible. There are a range of new technologies and techniques such as the Internet, World Wide Web and other electronic media forms that allow for the dissemination of data, information and knowledge. These advanced information and communications technologies can provide a new learning system that aid professors and students in breaking the boundaries of space and time and assist students in gaining the skills and abilities and utilise knowledge contained in various forms in our global. I believe there is a need for enhanced virtual and networked activity to support learning and share our knowledge especially in some developing countries! After many years working in industry and university, I have decided to share my knowledge and experience with all students in the world who study Electrical Engineering. Now, it is not a dream anymore! In this website, you can virtually attend my lectures, tutorials, computer Labs and quizzes and also access to lecture notes.
ALIA Institute\\n\\nThe ALIA Institute is a non-profit charitable organization located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It aims to support community and organizational leaders by bringing together systems-oriented tools and perspectives with the values and practices of authentic leadership. \\n\\nThe Institute began in 1998 as a dialogue among members of the Shambhala meditation community who were actively engaged in business, education, and civil society, and pioneering leaders in the fields of organizational and societal change - pathfinders such as Peter Senge, Margaret Wheatley, Juanita Brown, David Isaacs, and Art Kleiner. The intention behind this exploration was to discover a new model of leadership development that would adequately prepare organizational leaders for the challenges of the 21st century. This model would bring together Shambhala, as a source of pre-industrial wisdom and practices for realizing the potential of individuals and societies, with post-industrial research and methodologies related to leadership and whole-systems change.\\n\\nThis fusion turned out to be a powerful support for more effective action, especially in the domains of innovation, strategy, collaboration, and large-scale transformative change. It resulted in the week-long Authentic Leadership Summer Program, which was first offered in Nova Scotia in June 2001 and which has convened annually ever since.
The Change in female labor force in the United States and the introduction of the contraceptive pill\\n\\nFrom 1890 to mid 1970, although the female labor force participation in the states has increased steadily, most female workers were secondary earners and worked as secretaries, teachers, nurses etc. However, started from mid 1970, “quiet revolution” took place. Women not only participated in labor force, they also began to have long-term investment in graduate education and became career oriented. For example, in the 1970s, women increased to major in business administration and reduced their concentration on traditional female fields of education, such as home economics education and education. Women also began to further their education in professional schools at around 1970 (Goldin 10). \\n\\nIn fact, according to professor Claudia Goldin, one of the main reasons that women changed to be career oriented in 1970 was the introduction of the contraceptive pill. Contraceptive pill was approved and diffused among young women in the late 1960s and early 1970s. With the introduction of the pill, women increased the age of first marriage (Goldin 10-11). More importantly, the birth control pill provides a right and power for women to actively decide whether to have a child or not. \\n\\nReference: \\nGoldin, Claudia. “The Quiet Revolution That Transformed Women’s Employment, Education, and Family” (May 2006)
'''SCHOLAR RESCUE FUND'''\\n\\nEvery day scholars in some part of the world are threatened, harassed, arrested, tortured or even killed by governments, militants, and extremists of all types who see scholars’ efforts to promote thinking, dialogue, and wider understanding as threats to their authority and control. \\n\\n'''ESTABLISHING THE FUND'''\\n\\nAround the world, scholars have long suffered harassment, torture and persecution as a result of their work. In the worst cases, scholars pay with their lives for their dedication to scholarship and freedom of thought. In the post-Cold War era, the need to protect scholars has only increased.\\n\\nIn response to this ongoing international dilemma, the Institute of International Education (IIE), under the leadership of trustees Dr. Henry Jarecki and Thomas Russo, along with George Soros’ Open Society Institute, launched the Scholar Rescue Fund (SRF). The Fund provides fellowships to support temporary visits by threatened scholars to institutions in any safe country, anywhere in the world. \\n\\nThese fellowships support temporary academic positions at safe universities and colleges anywhere in the world. SRF scholars contribute to their host universities through teaching, research, lectures and other activities. In return, host universities provide professional guidance and financial and in-kind support. Scholars from any country may qualify.  At the end of their fellowships, scholars return to help rebuild countries ravaged by conflict, repression and fear. When safe return is not possible, SRF staff work with scholars to identify opportunities to continue their work abroad.\\n\\nIn 2002, the Institute’s trustees committed to making scholar rescue a permanent part of its work.  The Scholar Rescue Fund builds on work done by the Institute since its founding in 1919.  By assuring that persecuted scholars can get to a safe place and continue their work, we shine the light on those who would terrorize them and in the process threaten world peace.  We also help to preserve the intellectual capital of humanity, which is vital for progress.
\\n\\nThe great california became a country in 2007. The president [['''Mark Yudof''']] helped the country in many amazing ways. he helps with the economic troubles and all of the difficulties california has had in the past. The administration that he works with will seek to get around those rulings through a complex gas tax swap. As part of the scheme, an existing sales tax on gasoline would be eliminated and, at the same time, a new per-gallon excise tax would be imposed. The price at the pump would drop about 5 cents per gallon.\\n\\nThe shift would gut a voter-approved measure, Proposition 42, that protects how current gas taxes are spent. Public transit -- buses, rail and other forms of mass transportation -- now receives 20% of all gas sales tax. After the tax swap, that requirement would disappear. The tax swap could also cost schools -- as it would result in the share of tax revenues they are entitled to under state law dropping by more than $800 million.\\n\\nTo read more, click here.\\n \\nPPIC Report Analyzes How Counties are Dealing with Fiscal Crisis\\nDec. 21 -- The Public Policy Institute of California has released a report titled "Perceptions of Local Fiscal Stress During a State Budget Crisis,"  which details how California counties and cities are dealing with their own current fiscal crises.\\n\\nAccording to the report"s summary, "City and county governments in California have been hit hard by the state's recent budgetary and economic difficulties.

Introduction\\n\\nDifferential equations arise in many areas of science and technology; whenever a deterministic relationship involving some continuously changing quantities (modeled by functions) and their rates of change (expressed as derivatives) is known or postulated. This is well illustrated by classical mechanics, where the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time varies. Newton's Laws allow one to relate the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body and state this relation as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time. In many cases, this differential equation may be solved, yielding the law of motion.\\n\\nDifferential equations are mathematically studied from several different perspectives, mostly concerned with their solutions, functions that make the equation hold true. Only the simplest differential equations admit solutions given by explicit formulas. Many properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without finding their exact form. If a self-contained formula for the solution is not available, the solution may be numerically approximated using computers. The theory of dynamical systems puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations, while many numerical methods have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy.
The Resource Based Economy Foundation (RBEF) is a group of people with a common vision from various geographical locations. Our goal is to address the root causes that lead to the economic, ecological, and ethical problems that we see in the world today and by this contribute to a societal paradigm shift by depriving the negative effects of their causation. Our efforts are directed at removing the cause rather than being wasted on remedying the effects. \\n\\nThe RBEF is concerned with establishing legal and operational guidelines that will enable people and communities throughout the globe to achieve mutual cooperation and through that eliminate social, environmental, political, and economic restrictions that prevent humanity from progressing. RBEF is a set of tools for the transition from the Monetary System to Resource Based Economy and provides research on the transition economy model, develops global resource based projects, and a libre resources management platform. \\n\\nWe believe that the current economic setup creates more problems than provides solutions as can be noticed by following the very recent national and international events. Economy, in order to function, relies on the upholding of artificial goods scarcity which is maintained by various mechanisms known as "planned obsolescence", "abundance of scarcity", "priority of profit", "distortion of values", and "fiscal manipulation". All those mechanisms reflect negatively on environmental health, employment rates, economy, crime rates, moral values, standards of living, and life itself. The effects can be seen by the growing gap between rich and poor, which at the end only benefits the smallest part of humanity while destroying the remaining human lives, fauna and flora. \\n\\nWe understand the need for public presence and raising of awareness of fellow humans. Nevertheless, it is of utmost importance that we learn to understand the fundamental root causes of totalitarian institutions that lead to the current unacceptable form of society all over the world. Those fundamental causes include the misunderstanding about human behavior that creates and supports the economic dictatorships in power, and the erroneous design of the monetary economy that, a priori, must lead to stratification and a widening gap between economic classes, and unemployment, just to name the two major effects. \\n\\nOur tools to achieve a global prospering society are the creation of global awareness, education, understanding today's possibilities for technical solutions, and the application of the scientific method in order for humanity to invert this vicious cycle we find ourselves in today. \\n\\nWe work with the principles of openness and transparency including the use of today's already existing elements of resource-based economy ranging from open source software, through open content licenses, to open design of the transition plan. Following the principle "everyone is a leader", we have simply started implementing solutions, which we anticipate to become useful for humanity at large. \\n\\nFurther, we stress non-violent action by avoiding "us versus them" attitudes, and probably the most critical of all, giving people a positive prospect of the future. For this reason, we believe that it is important to point the beacon towards the ideas that have already liberated the awareness of approximately a million people world-wide, according to current estimates. This beacon into a prosperous and just future must be ignited right now.

Waterspouts exist on a microscale, where their environment is less than two kilometers in width. Their bigger cloud that develops them can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus, or as great as a supercell. While some waterspouts are strong (tornadic) like their land-based counterparts, most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics. They normally develop in moisture-laden environments with little vertical wind shear along lines of convergence, such as land breezes, lake effect bands, lines of frictional convergence from nearby landmasses, or surface troughs. Waterspouts normally develop as their parent clouds are in the process of development, and it is theorized that they spin up as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal shear near the surface, and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus or thunderstorm. Weak tornadoes, known as landspouts, have been shown to develop in a similar manner.[2]

"Anorexia mirabilis literally means "miraculous lack of appetite". It refers almost exclusively to women and girls of the Middle Ages who would starve themselves, sometimes to the death, in the name of God. The phenomenon is also known by the name "inedia prodigiosa" (a great starvation).[1]\\n\\nAnorexia mirabilis differs from the more modern, well-known anorexia nervosa in several distinct ways.\\n\\nIn anorexia nervosa, people usually starve themselves to attain a level of thinness, as the disease is associated with body image distortion. By contrast, anorexia mirabilis was frequently coupled with other ascetic practices, such as lifelong chastity, flagellant behavior, the donning of hairshirts, sleeping on beds of thorns, and other assorted self mutilations. It was largely a practice of Catholic women, who were often known as "miraculous maids".\\n\\nUntil recently, plumpness was a clear sign of affluence, and emaciation either a sign of poverty, ill health, or both. Women did not typically begin depriving themselves of food for outer beauty until the Victorian era, they did however starve themselves for spiritual fulfillment."
''New data on Mars's underground ice shows that the red planet likely has a very active water cycle.  Using heat emission observations from the Mars Odyssey spacecraft, researchers were able to map seasonal changes in the temperature of the red planet's surface to locate and measure the buried ice.   "This gives us a more detailed picture of the underground ice on Mars," said Joshua Bandfield, a research specialist at Arizona State University's School of Earth and Space Exploration in Tempe, who led the study.  The findings, which are reported in the May 3 issue of the journal Nature, show that the depth of the water-ice table varies greatly on Mars.  The results also suggest that water ice and water vapor in the planet's atmosphere can swap places as the planet undergoes regular cycles of warming and cooling.
{{failed}}\\n\\nAmong those who have spent significant amounts of time editing on Wikipedia are those who have had the misfortune of dealing with Administrators who have gone far beyond their administrative role of applying Wikipedia policy and respecting consensus, and have granted themselves authority to dictate Wikipedia policy as they see fit, regardless of consensus.

With current Wikipedia policy giving admins a lifetime sinecure, and the only means of disciplining admins in the hands of their fellow admins, there is no effective control over those who have exceeded their authority.\\n\\nWhile other reforms are desperately needed, the key proposal suggested here is to limit administrators to a renewable one-year term of office requiring renewal by a supermajority of Wikipedia editors.

Flipgigs is an online talent based student services marketplace connecting savvy consumers and businesses with an affordable network of talented , motivated, scrappy students from High Schools and Colleges who are eager to take on part-time jobs and gigs. \\n\\nFlipgigs was founded in the Spring of 2011 by Jayati Sengupta. According to Angel Investor Ron Conway, the most thought-provoking sector to develop in 2012 is the proliferation of peer-to-peer markets and the emergence of “collaborative consumption”. The age of so-lo-mo explosion has made it easier to share anything from resources to skills to assets and services.We are seeing a big shift in human relationships in the aftermath of web success in Facebook and LinkedIn era and I think this is just the beginning. A social platform like Flipgigs has the potential to very powerful. While everything else seems to be plummeting in today's tough economic times, one thing that continues to rise is the sticker price of college education. Moreover, with the stock market slump, the vast majority of parents are finding it extremely tough to dip into their dwindling retirement savings . Also, the student loan bubble is another bomb waiting to explode just like the housing mortgage crisis. That is where talent comes in. We already know students are very connected, resourceful and talented. We need a platform like Flipgigs to tap into this talent and have them find gigs easily. Students today need to start to wear a PIY attitude.(pay-it yourself)
As a person, I am an undergraduate linguistics researcher.  My languages of interest include: English, Italian, Emiliano-Romagnolo, and Persian.  My subjects of interest are Phonology, Phonotactics, Dialectology, Romance Ling, Historical Ling, Computational Ling, Lexicostatistics, and Cognitive Ling.\\n<br />\\nAs a Wikipedian, I am primarily interested in editing pages associated with languages and linguistics.  Linguistics, like other academic fields, contains individuals with many passionate opinions on the nature and theory of language.  Wikipedia should not be a soapbox for the advocacy of a particular theory.  However, I think it is important to present all existing theories so that people can make up their minds for themselves.  It becomes tedious and cluttery in Wikipedia to present every theory on a topic with its own list of pros and cons, however sometimes it is important to understand the line of reasoning in which a theory is discredited in the gradual evolution of scientific knowledge.\\n<br />\\nWikipedia has become the symbol of the 21st century age of information.  In milliseconds a vast medium of free information is available to everyone.  I want to contribute to wikipedia and participate in its gradual expansion.
Currently I am making contributions for several reasons: I want to practice my writing skills and request comment and feedback from other contributors as a means of improving my writing. I have read through Wikipedia's guidelines about quality and find it nearly impossible to digest all of it. Instead, small steps with criticism might be more productive. Secondly, I am interested in how the English speaking world has acted, reacted, and interacted with other parts of the world. My recent contributions focus on an Indian guru,  a newspaper editor, British colonial officials, a Togolese writer, and a Dutch-Indonesian writer.  I explore how these interactions shape and re-shape the English language. I see them as contributions to the most studied language in the world. Finally, I need to become more competent with the technical dimensions of writing, such as citing reliable sources, notability criteria, references and so forth. One of the most challenging things about Wikipedia is the opportunity to expand the notability criteria.
Low-cost terminal\\n\\nThis term is usually applied to a terminal building at an airport, which offers only the most basic features associated with terminals.

{{Userspace draft|Aeolian processes on Mars|date=April 2010}}\\nSand dunes have been observed throughout the surface of the planet Mars.  Movement of these dunes has been theorized and inferred from the lack of craters on dunes.  Dune movement has not yet been directly imaged, however.  Understanding sand movement processes is vital to a correct Martian climate model, as well as the safety of future missions to Mars.\\n\\n==Introduction==\\nOn Earth, sand is a very plentiful resource.  Wind, water and ice, as well as chemical reactions and biological activity, all serve to break apart rocks and other solid material into sand on a large scale.  While much of this sand is quickly stabilized by biological and hydrological processes, and converted into sedimentary rock, some of it, especially in desert climates where these influences are minimal, remains in the form of unconsolidated sand and dust for thousands of years or more, subject to influence by the wind.    \\nSand is an especially interesting material to study because of its granular nature.  When acted upon by wind, sand behaves in ways that, at first glance, seem peculiar.  Instead of being deposited evenly along a surface, sand self-accumulates into ripples, drifts, and dunes.  It can be piled high, but can only sustain slopes up to the material's angle of repose for the local gravitational force, beyond which the pile will undergo gravitational collapse.\\n\\nSand dunes cover an estimated 5,000,000 km2 of Earth’s surface (more than half the area of the United States), mostly in desert climes and along shorelines (Hayward et al., 2007).  Where surface sand dominates, it can present a serious hazard to machinery when made airborne.  For example, sand storms famously foiled President Jimmy Carter's attempt to rescue American hostages being held in Iran in 1980.  Granules of sand and dust are so small that they can sneak through microscopic gaps into the workings of complex machinery, causing serious malfunctions and short-circuits.  The abrasive action of airborne sand can damage or destroy structures and equipment alike.  Unchecked, dunes can cover and rend useless vitually anything downwind: roads, machinery, even entire settlements (Hayward et al., 2007; Jones, 2001).\\n\\nIt has been apparent that dunes exist on Mars since 1971, when Mariner 9 imaged the first extraterrestrial dune fields (Iverson, 1976).  Observations of extensive dune fields across the Red Planet in 1972, as well as the absence of any substantial liquid water or geological activity on the present Martian surface, make it clear that aeolian processes are indeed the dominant geomorphic forces which are shaping present-day Mars (Phillips, 1998).\\nThe United States’ “Vision for Space Exploration” includes stipulations for future exploration of Mars by both unmanned probes and crewed missions (Bush, 2004).  With a clear goal of establishing the presence of complicated machinery, where great expenditures and potentially the lives of astronauts will be at stake, it is absolutely essential to understand the mechanics of aeolian processes as they take place on Mars.  An essential part of this understanding would be determining the activity of the current Martian surface.\\n\\nDespite several successful lander and rover missions to Mars in the past few decades, as well as a steady improvement in the resolution of images taken from orbit, there is still no hard evidence of dune movement anywhere on present-day Mars (Williams, 2006).  This study sought to use available imagery from Mars orbiters and Opportunity rover to search for any dune movement.  The analysis concluded that saltation is likely occurring during the most severe storms on present day Mars, and that one saltation event likely occurred as recent as July, 2007.  However, no conclusive evidence for dune movement on present-day Mars was found.\\n\\n==Background==\\n\\n===The nature of sand on Earth===\\nDeserts cover approximately 20% of Earth’s surface, and sand covers 20% of Earth’s deserts (Watson, 1997).  Sand is created by the erosion of rock containing quartz, feldspar, or other hard minerals, as well as the erosion of coral and volcanic glass.  It is mainly found near seashores, where it is created by wave action, along rivers, where rocks frequently collide in strong currents, and in deserts, where it is created by aeolian processes.\\n\\nIt seems natural, when dealing with a problem of sand movement, to first define exactly what sand is.  Sand is a subset of all granular materials.  Granular materials can be as large as boulders, and can be as small as 1 µm (the scale where thermal vibration effects become significant).  Sand can be defined as any granular material which can be influenced by fluid flow, however, this definition must be restricted one degree further by putting a limit on the diameter of the material’s individual grains.  The need for this restriction is clear; while both a fine powder and a heap of boulders fit neatly into the granular material definition, they behave quite unlike traditional sand under a fluid in motion. A powder will be dispersed quite quickly and suspended under the action of a typical wind, while larger rocks will be entirely unaffected, disregarding abrasive erosion.\\n\\nThe definition of sand used by Bagnold is a very good general one for the purpose of dune study (Bagnold, 1941).  A lower limit for sand grain size can be found by investigating the behavior of a fluid flowing over a granular surface.  In natural situations, fluid flow is very rarely fully laminar; it will contain eddies, or “gusts”, which represent a local increase in wind speed and change in direction.  Some of these eddies will be in an upward direction, giving the potential for small particles to be suspended.  However, nearer to the ground, the upward and downward components of the eddies are weaker than other directions. While the intensity of these upward gusts is variable, it is commonly approximated as 20% of the mean wind velocity (Alghamdi and Akyurt, 2001).  Therefore, any particle with a terminal velocity lower than 0.2 times the mean wind velocity will be carried up and suspended indefinitely, provided the wind keeps up. Any particle which can achieve this suspension is defined as dust.\\n\\nAn upper limit for sand grain size is even easier to define.  Sand moves through two modes of transport: saltation and surface creep.  There is an additional mode, reptation, which is the minor saltation of sand grains physically dislodged by impacting particles, which typically do not have the energy to dislodge further grains (Lancaster, 1995; Parteli, 2007).  However, as is apparent by the definition, reptation is merely a subset of saltation, and so shall be included within this category.\\n\\nSaltation is the process where by sand grains actually become airborne, while surface creep is sand movement by which the grains never actually leave the ground.  At some upper limit, however, the combination of wind pressure and sand impact are no longer sufficient to move a grain of sufficient size.  Grains which remain stationary even in the most intense wind are defined as pebbles.  Therefore, any granular material which does not fall under the definition of dust or pebbles is sand.\\n\\nNatural sand never consists of uniformly-sized grains.  There will always be some natural variation in the size of sand grains, even those formed from the same rock and by the same process.  The distribution of sand grain sizes is known as the grading of the sand.\\n\\n===Nature of sand movement===\\nFluid-based sand transport takes place close to the planetary surface, within what is known as the boundary layer; the layer of wind above the ground where surface friction affects the local wind velocity.  Within the boundary layer, wind tends to vary logarithmically by height, defined by Equation 1.  \\n\\n	 	1\\n\\nThe terms used in this equation will be defined later, however there is an important term to point out now: u*, which is known as the shear velocity.  The shear velocity is not an actual velocity, but a mathematical parameter of a wind profile with units of velocity.  The shear velocity is constant for a given wind profile, so it is considered more convenient, in discussions of sand movement and other near-surface processes, to refer to boundary layer winds in terms of shear velocity rather than actual velocity.  \\n\\nA single grain can be moved in a variety of ways.  It can be moved as part of a sand avalanche on a slip face or it can be knocked forward along the ground (or even into the air) by an impacting airborne grain.  When analyzing the initiation of sand movement, however, it is necessary to study the case where a sand grain is moved by the direct pressure of the wind.\\n\\nA sand sheet is obviously stable under a fluid with no velocity.  At very low velocities, friction between individual grains in the sand sheet keeps them from moving.  However, as wind velocity increases, eventually drag and lift forces overcome the forces of friction and gravity keeping the sand grains in place, and the most exposed sand grains will become airborne (Lancaster, 1995).\\n\\nA grain lifted in this manner will likely have a small initial velocity in relation to the mean wind velocity at its initial height.  Therefore, the faster wind will impart some of its momentum upon this grain, possibly reaching an equilibrium, where the grain is moving at the local wind speed.  However, the airborne state of the sand particle is short-lived.  When the particle impacts the sand bed, it transfers its momentum, usually into several sand grains.  In this way, even grains not exposed enough or too large to be moved by the fluid threshold shear velocity may be dislodged and set in motion, which initiates a type of sand movement known as saltation.  Saltation is a mode of sand movement involving short jumps by individual particles, and is the process by which approximately 75% of sand movement occurs (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\nWhen the grain impacts the sand bed, it creates a splash, which is the propulsion of multiple sand grains at the impact site into the wind stream.  If the wind remains constant at or above u*ft, the flux of saltating grains q will initially increase exponentially as more and more grains are impacted and driven into the wind stream.  Since each additional saltating grain draws more momentum from the wind, the wind speed in the saltation layer decreases.  Eventually, the system reaches an equilibrium airborne grain density, where the force of the wind lifts as many grains as it possibly can into saltation.\\n\\nIn addition to increasing the number of grains in saltation, impacting grains also serve to initiate another type of sand movement, known as surface creep.  Even though grains that are a bit too large to saltate by direct wind pressure can be dislodged by impacting grains, other grains are too large to become airborne even when given this extra boost of momentum.  However, if these grains are not too large, they may be knocked forward along the sand surface without ever becoming airborne.  This is the process of surface creep:  descending grains impact other larger grains, moving them forward slightly before friction stops them.\\n\\nOnce saltation has been initiated, the main producer of saltating particles is the impact of other saltating particles on the sand bed.  A peculiar consequence of this property is that after the initiation of saltation, the shear velocity may drop below u*ft, and saltation will still continue.  At this point, the fluid threshold shear velocity becomes unimportant, and a new, lower threshold comes to light.  It is only when the shear velocity drops below this new level, the impact threshold shear velocity (u*t), that saltation will cease.\\n\\nThe aforementioned saturation of the boundary layer is not an instantaneous process.  For any given grain distribution and wind speed, there is a lag between the time saltation is initiated and when the maximum grain density is reached.  The saturation length is the distance a parcel of fluid moves before achieving the maximum grain density (Bagnold, 1941).  It also represents a rough measure of the distance it takes for a change in one property of the wind flow to reform into a new velocity profile according to Equation 1.\\n\\nSand movement, taken on the level of individual grains, is understandably chaotic.  A single wind-blown grain impacting the surface can knock multiple grains into random trajectories.  However, taking the average paths of individual saltating grains gives the characteristic path for a given sand and wind.  The length of this path is the saltation length, Ls, an important parameter in many sand transport models, as well as in the formation of ripples, which will be described later (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\nThe velocity distribution of the wind in the boundary layer is roughly logarithmic by height, as can be seen in Equation 1.  However, the level at which the velocity actually drops to zero is slightly above the actual ground level.  In fact, for different values of shear velocity over the same surface, the wind speed drops to zero at the same height.  This term, z0, is known as the surface roughness, which will be explained later.  It changes greatly between different types of terrain, and is dependant mainly on the degree of sand movement and dominant grain size.\\n\\n==Physics of sand movement==\\nSand, a granular material, has some properties of a fluid, some properties of a solid, and some of neither.  As such, it requires unique equations to describe its behavior, particularly when under the influence of a flowing fluid.\\n\\nSome of the first equations to accurately predict the movement of sand and sand formations were formulated by Ralph A. Bagnold.  His book, Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes, was the first comprehensive study on all forms of sand transport.  It is still used actively many decades later, and may still be the best work on the physics of sand dunes.  Many of his original equations will be useful in this analysis.\\nWithin the planetary boundary layer, mean wind velocity u varies logarithmically with height z according to the relation shown here\\n\\n	 	1\\n\\nwhere κ = 0.40 is the von Kármán constant (AMS, 2000), u* is the wind shear velocity, and z0 is the surface roughness. The terms u∗ and z0 are independent variables which may be determined experimentally.  The von Kármán constant does not depend on atmospheric properties; it is an experimentally derived universal constant.  It should be noted that z0 is not an actual measure of surface roughness, but an apparent measure, which will be explained later.\\n\\nWith the wind velocity distribution known, it is natural to investigate what strength of wind is needed to initiate sand movement.  Individual sand grains are rough, irregular chunks of material, varying widely from the theoretical spherical shape.  Therefore, as Bagnold pointed out, it is convenient to find a scaling factor for determining the diameter of a sphere of equivalent composition as the non-spherical sand grains which will behave identically under the influence of a fluid.  This shape factor is dependant largely upon the amount of weathering that the sand has undergone, as well as the average grading of the sand.  It must often be determined experimentally; for desert sand on Earth, 0.75 is a good approximation. (Bagnold, 1941)  Multiplying the actual average diameter of sand grains by the shape factor yields the apparent grain diameter, which will be used from here on in place of the actual grain diameter.\\n\\nThere are actually two forces imparted upon an exposed sand grain by the wind. (Parteli, 2007)  The first, a drag force, is due to the friction of the moving air on the grain, and is in the direction of the fluid flow.  It is described by the equation\\n\\n	 	2\\n\\nwhere d is the diameter of the particle, σ is its density, β is a constant which depends on the packing of the grains, and u* is the shear velocity.  The second force, the lift force, is\\n\\n	 	3\\n\\nwhere Δp is the difference in pressure from the bottom to the top of the grain.  On the scale of sand grains, due to the strong velocity gradient near the surface, the lift force is very significant.  On Earth, it is approximately equal to 85% of the magnitude of the drag force. \\n\\nAt the initiation of sand movement, the drag and lift forces work to rotate the grain over some pivot point p.  These forces are resisted by the grain’s weight, which is \\n\\n	 	4\\n\\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid and g is the planetary gravitational constant.  Thus, with a momentum balance, it is easily possible to find the threshold parameters for grain movement.  \\n\\nThe forces balance over a pivot point p seen on the right.  Therefore, when (5) is true, \\n\\n	 	5\\n\\nthe saltation process begins (Parteli, 2007).\\n\\nThere are several important parameters which govern sand movement, as well as two important thresholds which indicate when movement will begin.  Under unchanging topographic conditions, the shear velocity is defined by another important quantity, the shear stress, τf according to the relation\\n\\n	           	6\\n\\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid.  The shear stress is merely a measure of the drag force per unit surface area.\\nAs the shear velocity increases, the drag force and lift force increase as well.  The value of u* where the inequality shown in (5) is true is called the fluid threshold shear velocity (u*ft).  An equation for u*ft is \\n\\n	 	7\\n\\nwhere A is the Shields parameter.  The Shields parameter has been determined experimentally in the past, and is relatively constant on Earth.  Under low atmospheric pressure, however, the Shields parameter has a complex dependence upon the grain diameter and wind velocity.\\n\\nAt the fluid threshold, the most exposed sand grains begin to be entrained in the fluid.  Because the velocity of the wind works parallel to the surface, the motion of the grain is temporary; soon, any upward motion of the grain is checked by the grain’s weight, and the grain impacts the sand bed some distance downstream (Bagnold, 1941).\\nAs mentioned above, the additional momentum imparted to grains on impact allows grains of larger sizes to enter saltation.  Thus after the initiation of saltation the impact threshold shear velocity (u*t) becomes the more important parameter.  It is typically near 80% of the value of u*ft (Parteli, 2007).  \\n\\nIf dune movement is indeed occurring, then an important factor to know is the sand flux q, or the weight of sand transported per second.  Here is where Bagnold’s work becomes insufficient, as his sand flux equations are fairly accurate, but do not predict the existence of a threshold velocity.  A universal sand flux equation, which has been confirmed by both wind tunnel and field experiments, here shown as Equation 8 (White, 1979; Lancaster, 1995).\\n\\n	 	8\\n\\nThe problem, then, for determining the existence of dune movement on Mars through calculation, lies in the knowledge of several key features of the local Martian surface.  Indeed, it is very possible that there are places on Mars where saltation still occurs, and others where aeolian features are “petrified”, no longer influenced by the prevailing winds.\\n\\n==Dune formation and movement==\\n\\n===Small-scale sandforms===\\nSand under the influence of wind can be found in many different formations, dependant upon many factors, including grain size, average shear velocity, sand availability, and the presence of obstacles.  Sandform is a generic term for any sandy deposit or formation.\\n\\nThe simplest sandform is one found in the wake of an immobile object, such as an exposed rock, known as a sand shadow (Bagnold, 1941).  Sand shadows are formed by deposition of sand in saltation due to localized reduction of shear velocity in the wind shadow of such an immobile object.  \\n\\nBehind any object within a fluid flow, there is a surface of discontinuity, outside of which the flow is roughly laminar near the mean wind speed, but inside of which is turbulent, with a mean velocity lower than the mean wind speed.  The reason that sand, not dust, is deposited in these areas is a direct consequence of the definition of sand we are using here.  While sand is highly influenced by the wind, it will tend to follow a uniform trajectory rather than a changing streamline in the wind.  So a grain flying over or around an object while in saltation may, by chance, fall into the wind shadow behind the object, where it will likely stay.  A dust grain in suspension, however, will tend to follow the changing streamlines and fly past the wind shadow.\\n\\nIn addition to sand deposits found in the wake, any obstacle will also have a small pile in front of it, due to yet another wind shadow in front.\\n \\nFigure 3: Wind flow around a surface object.  Sand will tend to accumulate in the wind shadow, where the wind is turbulent with a lower average speed\\n\\nA related sand formation is a sand drift, which forms in gaps between objects and in wind shadows caused by changes in terrain.  \\n\\nSand shadows and drifts require the presence of obstacles to alter the boundary layer fluid flow.  However, one of the most interesting properties of sand is that a flat sand sheet is unstable under a fluid flow.  The mechanism for this peculiar property becomes apparent when you analyze the case of saltation over a flat sheet of sand.  \\nTake the simplifying case of a flat sheet of sand undergoing a uniform barrage of saltating grains.  In addition to there being a characteristic path to describe the average path of saltating grains, it turns out that all grains descend at a very uniform angle of descent.  Because of this, the descending grains can be represented by parallel vectors, as in Figure 4.  \\n\\nA “flat” sand sheet can not be perfectly flat, as it consists of finite grains of roughly circular proportions.  As such, at any moment there exists a multitude of minuscule pits and discontinuities.  Figure 4 shows just such a deformation, where a small depression has formed momentarily due to a few saltating grains being removed.  Because of the near-uniform descent angle of grains in saltation, the existence of the depression causes more sand grains to impact in the downwind slope of the crater than the upwind slope.\\n\\nThe sand flux due to surface creep, qc, is proportional to the number of impacts per surface area.  Therefore, the downwind side of the temporary depression is suddenly subjected to a much higher sand flux.  Since there are now more grains moving out of the depression than into it, a continuous saltation will serve to deepen the depression and extend it downwind.\\n\\nWhen the sand surface begins to deviate from the ideal flat sand sheet case, the ideal situation seen in Figure 4 with an even distribution of descending grains at a constant angle no longer applies.  Knowing that saltating grains have a characteristic path, a grain leaving the sand bed at some point will tend to land very near to a point one saltation length downwind.  Therefore, if an area has a much higher sand flux due to increased saltation impacts, the same will apply for an area one saltation length downwind.  In this way, a single chance depression will soon become an extended area of sand ripples.  These sand ripples have a very regular wavelength which is dependent upon the prevailing wind speed, and is remains constant over time as long as the wind speed remains constant.\\n\\nThe shape and height of these ripples depends on the surface sand grading, or the distribution of sand grain size.  This can be deduced by a simple analysis of growing ripples:  as the height of each ripple increases, the average velocity at the grains will increase according to the boundary-layer wind distribution (Equation 1).  If the range of grain sizes in a particular sand bed is small, the higher wind speed at the top of ripples will tend to topple the grains at the crest into the next trough.  Therefore a narrower range of grain sizes will result in smaller ripples.  A wider range of grain sizes will allow for larger ripples.\\n\\nAs seen previously, an area of increased grain impacts will also see an increase in the grains moved by surface creep.  Therefore, if a significant portion of the grains in the sand bed can only move by surface creep, a different kind of sand formation will be seen.  In this case, after the initiation of saltation, the smaller grains are slowly removed until the larger grains begin to dominate.  Ripple-like formations will still emerge, but they will have essential differences.  Larger grains only capable of surface creep will begin collecting at each crest, creating a wind shadow for the subsequent trough similar to that in Figure 4.  Since the larger grains are moved much slower than the smaller grains, and cannot move in their own shadow due to a lack of saltation, the collection at each crest grows larger, as shown in Figure 5.  These features are known as ridges.\\n\\nAt some point, assuming uniform conditions throughout the sand bed, the ridges will grow large enough to shelter the troughs completely, halting saltation, and creating a stable configuration of small, steep-faced ripples.  However, a more common case is one where there is an oncoming saltation from upstream.  In this scenario, the surface creep will continue to build the ridges higher.  With higher ridges, the wind shadows grow longer, and subsequently the wavelength increases.  If saltation conditions prevail for long periods, ridges can grow indefinitely.  So unlike ripples, the wavelength of ridges does not depend on the mean wind velocity.\\n \\nFigure 5:  A typical ridge.  The line AC represents the wind shadow where no saltation or surface creep is taking place, the line DA is the area of maximum surface creep, and the line AB is where creeping grains from the crest are avalanching down the downwind slope.  From Bagnold, 1941.\\n\\nThere is a third feature, known as a megaripple, which can form under the same conditions as normal ripples.  They are widely spaced, less regular in their repetition than normal ripples.  It is unknown whether their wavelengths are dependant upon grain distribution or properties of the local wind regime.  Little is known about their genesis or evolution, and many consider them to be dunes rather than ripples or ridges, but they have been widely observed on the surface of Mars. \\n\\nOne important feature distinguishes ripples and ridges from other sand forms.  In ripples and ridges, the coarsest grains appear at the crests, with finer grains in the troughs.  The opposite is true for so-called large-scale sand formations, the majority of which are true sand dunes.\\n\\n===Dune formation===\\nThe genesis of dunes has actually been observed only rarely in any detail (Lancaster 1995).  Only a few studies have documented properties of dunes from formation until maturity, and these only noted the physical transformation of the dune, not the sand properties believed to be important in dune genesis.  The accepted theory regarding dune formation comes mainly from the study of mature dunes and wind tunnel scenarios, so there is an inherent uncertainty in the exact processes which take place.\\n\\nContrary to popular belief, a sandy desert floor on Earth is rarely composed entirely of sand.  A typical desert floor is either composed of a sandy surface interspersed with pebbles and a few larger boulders, or what is known as a desert pavement, where all surface sand and dust have been removed, leaving a layer of interlocking pebbles.\\nThe desert pavement case is irrelevant for our purposes.  In other areas, large pebbles among smaller sand grains will tend to space themselves out evenly, regardless of their initial distribution.  Because of this, the presence of pebbles tends to stabilize a sand sheet, halting saltation by raising z0, the level at which average wind velocity drops to zero.  However, if a sand sheet stabilized by pebbles is subjected to a stronger wind, more sand may be removed, until another equilibrium level is reached where the sand grains are sheltered by the pebbles.\\n\\nA sandy area with large pebbles can sustain a much higher sand flux than a bare sand sheet.  This is due to the tendency of saltating grains to rebound higher and longer when impacting an immobile object such as a pebble.  So when a patch of bare sand forms by deposition or other processes, the tendency will be for upwind saltation to deposit sand on an existing sand patch.  However, a pebbly surface will have a much higher surface roughness than a surface of bare sand, and so the fluid threshold shear velocity will be much higher as well.  So if the shear velocity is not much higher than u*ft for the pebbly surface (a “gentle” wind), the sand patch will be stretched downwind and dispersed.\\n\\nIn the case of a shear velocity much higher than both fluid thresholds (around 4×u*ft, a “strong” wind), saltation will begin in earnest before the wind reaches the sand patch.  At the upwind edge of the sand patch, saltation increases violently, causing substantial drag which causes a reduction in the wind velocity at and just upwind of the bare sand patch, which in turn results in a net deposition of sand.  In this way, a strong wind will serve to increase the thickness of a sand patch, as well as extend it upwind. The same process has been shown to occur in areas where the surface roughness changes more gradually, due to a change in the sand grading.\\n\\nIn order for dunes to form in these areas of changing surface roughness, four conditions must be satisfied.  First, wind which causes saltation along the smoother sand surface must not blow for too long, lest it dissipate the sand accumulation entirely.  Second, for the duration that the strong wind blows, there must be a consistent supply of sand from upstream, or else the smoother sand patch will quickly dissipate in much the same manner.  Third, there must not be a large amount of grains in surface creep, as these grains will tend to encroach upon the smoother patch of sand, preventing dune growth.  Fourth and lastly, the smoother sand must be at least as long as the saturation length, as there will be varying instances of removal and deposition as the new wind profile adjusts.  This saturation length, usually between 4 and 6 meters on earth, represents a lower limit for the size of true sand dunes.\\n\\nThere are two mechanisms by which upwind saltation could be sustained.  The first case we will consider is a unidirectional wind profile, where both strong and gentle winds blow in the same direction (±15º) (Lancaster, 1995).\\nIn a unidirectional wind regime, any sand patches will have no mechanism by which to become wider, and may only extend in the downwind direction.  This leads to the appearance of sand strips, which are arranged parallel to the prevailing wind.  Unless the wind is much higher than the sand’s threshold shear velocity, these sand strips will soon thin out to the point where buried pebbles start to reemerge, in addition to encroaching grains in surface creep.  However, if a period of strong winds occurs, an interesting self-sustaining wind regime may form close to the surface.  The intense saltation ongoing over the sand strips saturates the boundary layer, slowing the near-surface wind velocity significantly.  \\n\\nThe intervening areas between strips are pebbly, and under a gentle wind the higher surface roughness dictates that the near-surface wind velocity will be lower than over the sand strip.  This situation changes in the above case of a very strong wind.  While there may or may not be saltation over the pebbly surface, the density of saltating grains will be less, assuming the wind is not so strong that this area is saturated as well.  This creates alternating streams of slower and faster wind, which tends to create small eddies and vortices, the sum of which is a convergent wind pattern on the sand strips.  This process can be seen in Figure 7.  If the strong wind can be sustained for a long enough time, these sand strips may eventually build into longitudinal dunes, which are arranged parallel to the wind flow.\\n\\nThe second case, where gentle winds blow in a different direction than the stronger winds, is much simpler.  If an isolated sand patch is created, a strong wind will build it up, at the expense of a now-denuded area just downwind.  If gentle winds occur, just barely above the saltation threshold, from a different direction, they will thin out the accumulated pile slightly, but also replenish the denuded area with a fresh layer of sand.  This regime tends to create oblique dunes or transverse dunes, depending on the magnitude of the direction difference.  Oblique dunes are arranged at an angle to the direction of dune propagation, while transverse dunes are perpendicular to the direction of dune propagation.  Regardless of which case occurs, a continuation of strong winds will build a budding dune steadily up to a certain point.  However, when the dune reaches a size where it begins to alter the nearby wind profile, it no longer needs a strong wind to sustain it.  \\n\\nWhen a dune first forms, a cross-section taken parallel to the dune-building wind typically takes a shape similar to the one shown in Figure 8.  Because of the projection of the dune up into the wind stream, the dune significantly alters the wind profile.  Closer streamlines on the upwind or stoss side of the dune show areas of higher wind velocity, indicative of a net positive sand flux, or sand removal.  On the downwind or lee side of the dune, the streamlines spread apart, showing an area of net negative sand flux, or sand deposition.  In this way, a dune can move essentially unaltered across a desert floor, even if the wind is only strong enough to move the bare sand on the dune.\\n \\nFigure 8:  New dune altering the wind profile above itself.  The streamlines appear closer together on the stoss side of the developing dune, and further apart on the lee side, so sand is removed from the front of the dune and deposited downwind, causing dune movement.\\n\\nA sand dune can not remain in this uniform, hill-like profile for long.  Equation 9 gives the sand flux on a simple hill-shaped dune undergoing no net flux (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\n	 	9\\n\\nwhere x is the horizontal distance from the upwind foot of the dune, c is the velocity of the dune, ρs is the density of the sand in bulk (including air between grains), and α is the inclination of the dune surface at point x.  Therefore, all other factors being equal, the both the net removal and deposition of sand will occur at the point where the slope is the steepest, shown in Figure 8.  With an unequal sand flux, different areas of the dune will begin to advance at different rates, leading to an oversteepening of the lee slope as seen in Figure 9.\\n\\nWhen sand is piled on itself, like any granular material, it can only support itself against the force of gravity to a certain point.  Because of frictional and inter-grain cohesive forces, a sand pile can achieve a fairly large angle, typically around 34º for sand on Earth.  Any slope steeper than this angle will collapse, avalanching until the slope below this critical angle, known as the angle of repose.  In the case of a moving dune, sand avalanching in this manner will eventually morph the lee slope into a fairly straight slope just shallower than the angle of repose.  This straight slope is known as a slip face, and is always roughly transverse to the direction of winds above the saltation threshold.\\n\\nWith the formation of the slip face, the lee of the dune now contains a wind shadow, with a surface of discontinuity roughly equal to the surface of the ideal “sand hill” shown in Figure 8.  The wind shadow will serve to increase deposition even further at the foot of the dune, causing dunes with slip faces to continue to grow.  The dune has now reached maturity, and will continue to evolve and migrate as long as there is a consistent wind above the saltation threshold.  \\n\\n===Dune types===\\nThe exact evolution of the dune beyond its initial formation depends upon two factors:  the amount of sand available for saltation outside of the dune, and the wind regime complexity.  The previous descriptions of dunes as, longitudinal, oblique, or transverse refers only to the arrangement of individual dunes in a group in reference to the prevailing wind regime.  These terms have little or no bearing on the actual dune type.  There are three major types of dunes, each of which represents different local conditions, and, most importantly, all of which are found on Mars (Lancaster, 1995).\\n\\nThe first dune type, arguably the easiest to recognize, is the barchan dune.  Barchans form in areas of limited sand availability and unidirectional wind regimes.  The stoss side of the dune is relatively featureless and dome-shaped.  The slip face is curved, resembling a bite which has been taken out of a dome-shaped dune, terminating with two horns extending downwind, one on each side of the dune.\\n\\nNow, the curved slip face is not an indication of changing wind directions.  It is a consequence of the change in sand-wind interaction as the dune grows.  A larger dune begins to interrupt the linear fluid flow, causing it to curve slightly around both sides of the dune.  Since the local wind speed is the most important factor in determining the slip-face orientation, this slight curvature of the horizontal wind profile causes the slip-face to become curved (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\nFigure 10 shows a very neat example of a Martian barchan dune.  This dune exists near 41.4°S 44.6°E, on the western rim of Hellas Basin, the largest impact crater on Mars, and is part of a chain of barchans not seen to the lower left and upper right.  In this image, by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE imager, all the classic barchan features are visible.  The curved, crescent-shaped slip face is prominently featured in the center, dissipating into two “horns” downwind.  The remainder of the dome-shaped dune is covered in sand ripples, which tend to form on barchans due to their unidirectional wind environment.  The dune-forming wind is from ENE-to-WSW, and the ground outside of the dune is a jumbled bedrock terrain, distributed with small sand deposits, suggesting very limited sand availability.  The dune is about 120 m long from stoss foot to horn tip, with the horn-to-horn distance of about 40 m, fairly typical of large barchans found on Earth.\\n\\nThe barchan is one type of the larger group of crescentic dunes, all of which are formed under unidirectional wind regimes.  Another type of crescentic dunes is very closely related, crescentic ridges (not actual ridges, but a type of dune).  Crescentic ridges resemble parallel chains of barchan dunes which tend to overlap.  Logically, crescentic ridges form in areas where sand availability is higher than with pure barchans, but the wind regime is still unidirectional (Lancaster, 1995).  \\n\\nOn earth, the most common type of dune is the linear dune.  However, on Mars, linear dunes only appear to be dominant in about 5% of large dune fields (Hayward et al., 2007).  Linear dunes appear when there are two dominant sand-moving directions, separated by more than 15º. (Lancaster, 1995)  The slip face is not fixed with respect to a linear dune, but shifts from one side of the crest to the other as the wind regime changes.  A related dune type which has also been found on Mars is the reversing dune, which is formed by a wind regime which periodically changes direction close to 180º.\\n\\nAn even more complicated wind regime, featuring three or more prominent wind directions, results in the formation of star dunes.  These can be the largest dunes, building to several hundred meters high on Earth.  These dunes have multiple slip faces, which are active and inactive depending on the current direction of the wind.  On Mars, they are often found on the floor of smaller craters such as Victoria Crater.\\n\\n==Expected nature of sand-surface interaction on Mars==\\n\\n===Martian weather and climate===\\nMars has long been theorized to have an active atmosphere, possessing many of the familiar transient atmospheric characteristics which we on Earth call “weather”.  As early as 1877, Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli observed what he thought were “clouds” in the Martian sky (Parteli, 2007).  While it is almost certain that what he observed were dust storms which cover the surface of Mars every year or so, it began the race to determine just how “alive” the Martian atmosphere currently is.\\n\\nMariner 9 offered the first up-close look at the planet and its atmosphere in 1971.  Imagery at Mariner 9’s arrival indicated that Mars was in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm, obscuring the surface to the point that the striking polar ice caps were not even visible (Parteli, 2007).\\n\\nAfter a few weeks, the dust storm cleared, allowing for the first clear, high-resolution images of the Martian surface.  These images clearly showed large expanses of dune fields on all corners of the planet.  This spurred theories of an active atmosphere with ongoing sand movement.\\n\\nFive years later, the Viking landers reached the surface of Mars, taking the first direct measurements of wind speed in an extraterrestrial environment.  They measured a mean wind speed which rarely exceeded 10 m/s, which corresponds to a wind shear velocity of approximately 0.8 m/s, assuming several theoretical values are correct (Moore, 1985).  These wind measurements were only taken at one height (1.6 m), so the typical wind profile on Mars could still only be estimated.\\n\\nThere were several significant dust storms during the Viking missions, each of which was associated with a peak in wind speeds to 20 m/s or more.  In at least one case, the wind reached 40-50 m/s (wind shear velocity 3-4 m/s) for a period of around 40 seconds at the Viking 1 lander, causing the first observed saltation event on Mars.\\n\\nThe Pathfinder rover, Sojourner, contained instruments to gather this missing data.  The Pathfinder landing site (19.33 N, 33.55 W) was not far from the Viking 1 site (22.697° N latitude and 48.222° W longitude), and in an area of similar surface composition (Sullivan, 2002).  Sojourner  featured a meteorological boom with three wind socks, which was to help fill in the missing data.  Unfortunately for the meteorological goals of the mission (although probably fortunately for the mission in general), the weather was calm for the entire 83 Martian-day mission, with the wind never climbing above 10 m/s at the 1 meter elevation, and no observed sand or dust movement (Sullivan et al., 2000; Sullivan 2002).  There was enough data to estimate a fluid threshold shear velocity of 4.5 m/s, much higher than the numerically and experimentally predicted value of 2.0-2.5 m/s, likely due to the abundance of boulders and large rocks (Sullivan, 2002).\\n\\nThus it is expected that the average weather on Mars is relatively calm.  However, during dust storms, it appears that winds above the saltation threshold can occur, and have occurred in the past.  These planet-wide dust storms occur almost every year in the Martian northern-hemisphere autumn, and likely happen with such repetition because the atmospheric pressure is highest at that time (Larsen et al., 2002).\\n\\nTemperature at the surface has only a minor influence on saltation, aside from possibly preventing it in the case where water or CO2 frost accumulates.  Temperature has been found to vary widely with season, latitude, and time of day, just as on Earth, but typically is in the range of 180-260 K (-135ºF to 10ºF) in the summer and 160-200 K (-170ºF to -100ºF) in the winter.\\n\\n===Global distribution of sand dunes and sheets on Mars===\\nAlthough aeolian processes are ubiquitous on Mars, large-scale sand sheets/seas, dune fields and ergs are not as extensive on Mars as on Earth.  A recent estimate of the coverage of large-scale sand features (dune fields and sand sheets) on Mars is on the order of 800,000 km2, or about 1% of the Martian surface surveyed in that study (Hayward et al., 2007).  On Earth, large-scale sand features cover approximately 5,000,000 km2, and while this is 1.0% of the Earth’s total surface area, it is 3.4% of Earth’s land area.\\n\\nOn Mars, dunes are found almost exclusively within craters and Valles Marineris, the 4000 km-long canyon system near the planet’s equator.  While on Earth most dunes are linear in nature, on Mars a vast majority of dunes are crescentic, with a smaller amount being linear (Hayward et al., 2007).  Large dune fields feature very few star dunes; however, smaller dune fields in medium-sized craters almost universally have a star-like appearance.\\n\\nAs aeolian processes seem to be the only active geological processes on Mars, aside from impact craters and very localized water action, the lower concentration of dunes compared to Earth suggests that there is less sand available for saltation, either because winds above the saltation threshold are less prevalent or there is less total sand on Mars.  Indeed, it may be a combination of the two.  The main source of erosion which produces sand-sized particles on Earth is oceans and other hydrological processes; these are obviously absent from present-day Mars.  On top of that, evidence for present-day winds above the saltation threshold is very sparse.  Prior to the landing of the Mars Exploration Rovers, there has only been one verified instance of indirectly observed saltation on Mars, during the (Viking 1) Martian Dust Storm of Sol 1742 (Moore, 1985).\\n\\n===Properties of the surface and atmosphere at Meridiani Planum===\\nWhile the initial scope of this study was a planet-wide search for dune movement, eventually the search for directly-observed movement of sand moved to Meridiani Planum, in the area around Victoria Crater, where Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has been aggressively imaging the landscape.  \\n\\nWind data is sparse for the Martian surface.  Only three landers have succeeded in making wind measurements, and only the two Viking landers have a data set more than a few months long.  However, these data sets agreed that the shear velocity rarely exceeds 1.0 m/s, and only dust storms contain winds strong enough to produce saltation. This is much lower than u*ft, which is estimated to be approximately 2.0 m/s at Meridiani Planum (Sullivan et al., 2005).\\nFor the area of Meridiani Planum, as with most of the surface of Mars, the sand is composed of basaltic sandstone.   The grains are approximately 50-150µm in diameter, topped by a scattering of pebbles as large as a few millimeters.  The density of grains has been estimated as approximately 3200 kg/m3 (Sullivan et al., 2005).\\n\\nLike Earth, the wind is rarely dead calm on Mars.  This is apparent from wind speed measurements by both Viking landers and Sojourner rover, which were typically less than 10 m/s (22 mph), but were rarely dead calm.  At Meridiani Planum, prevailing winds during apparently calm weather gradually removed dust from Opportunity’s solar panels over a period of 50 Martian days in the summer of 2006.\\n\\n===Expectations for sand dune movement on Mars===\\nMany studies have attempted to find conclusive evidence of sand movement on Mars.  It is apparent that dunes are either migrating very slowly now, or have migrated in the recent past.  There are two main bodies of evidence which support this:  first, there are very few known impact craters on dunes, and second, most Martian dunes appear crisp, with well-defined slip faces.  Studies have estimated that, if sand movement does occur, it is at a rate of 1-8 cm per year at most (Fenton, 2006).\\n\\nDune fields at Rabe Crater (44 ºS, 35ºE) and Proctor Crater (48ºS, 30ºE) have shown strong evidence for dune movement.  Images of Rabe Crater dunes show alternating dark and light streaks on the dunes’ slip faces which change even over the course of a single Martian year, which have been interpreted as saltation-induced grainflows (Fenton, 2006).  Images of Proctor Crater dunes indicate possible slip face reversing on barchanoid dunes (Fenton et al., 2005).  There is even a suggestion in this study that one slip face moved as much as 37 m, however, no study has yet succeeded in directly imaging a large-scale change in dune positions, which would confirm dune migration.\\n\\n==Observation techniques==\\n\\n===History of early observations of Mars===\\nMars is a prominent visible feature in the night sky.  At its closest approach to Earth, it is the 4th brightest object in the night sky, and one of the only visible objects to be bright red.  As such, it has been observed since man first gazed upward, and was recorded by many ancient civilizations as a star signifying war or death.  Until the 17th century, however, it was merely a mote of red light, varying in brightness over the period of a few years.\\n\\nThe first observations of recognizable features on the planet’s surface are attributable to Christiaan Huygens, who sketched a dark plain now known as Syrtis Major, as well as the bright southern polar ice cap, in 1672.  In the same year, Giovanni Domenico Cassini observed a transit of a small star by Mars, and concluded that it must have a very thick atmosphere; although it turned out that his observations were flawed, this was the first “evidence” of a dynamic Martian atmosphere.  In the early 18th century, Giacomo Filippo Maraldi drew what he thought were clouds stretched across the planet, though these turned out to be permanent features of the planets surface which are still visible today.  He also described changes he observed in the southern ice cap, and suggested that the properties of the surface there changed somehow from year to year (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nIn 1783, William Herschel observed another Martian transit and concluded that Cassini’s observations of a very thick Martian atmosphere were false.  However, he also observed what he called “occasional changes of partial bright belts”, concluding they were storm clouds above the planet.  As the few clouds known to exist on Mars are not visible even today from Earth, Herschel likely was observing local dust storms.  In the 1820s and 1830s, Johann Heinrich Mädler and Wilhelm Beer made many contributions to the study of Mars, conclusively proving that the previously observed dark patches were permanent surface features, and determining the planet’s rotational period to within a few seconds.  In 1837 they observed that Mars was nearly featureless save the ice caps, possibly indicating the first observation of a planet-wide dust storm.  In 1864, Rev. William Rutter Dawes improved greatly upon Mädler and Beer’s observations, making drawings depicting almost every major albedo feature identified today (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nAt this point, there was little more that could be learned from earth-bound telescopes, given the limitations imposed by atmospheric aberrations.  In fact, further refinement of observations, more often than not, were completely wrong.  In the 1870’s, Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli first made the infamous claims of canali, Italian for “canals” or “channels”, on the surface of Mars.  As it turned out, the “channels” were either illusions due to optical effects, or simply imagined features (Sheehan, 1996).  Until the 1960s, the prominent theory was that the dark albedo features on Mars were swaths of vegetation, and the ice caps were seasonal patches of water-ice (Sheehan, 1996).  There were observations of yellow clouds, thought to be dust storms, and white clouds, thought to be analogous to earthbound clouds.  There was even a scientific consensus that many dark features were blue in color (Sagan and Kellogg 1963).\\n\\nHowever, there were some doubters to the scientific consensus.  Some theorized a desert-like planet with large dune fields and no vegetation.  As early as the 1950s the idea of a Martian surface dominated by sand dunes was proposed (Gifford, 1964).  A few scientists also doubted the existence of the canali as anything more than mere optical illusions.\\n\\n===Observations from Martian probes===\\nThose doubters were proven right by the observations of Mariner 4 in 1965.  Sending spacecraft to Mars was no small task—several probes launched by both Russia and the United States failed to reach Mars successfully in early 1963 and mid-1965.  Mariner 4 performed the first successful fly-by of Mars in July, 1965.  It was only able to take 22 discontinuous, low-resolution, blurry images, but they were sufficient to reveal that the traditional view of Mars’s atmosphere was quite wrong.  The images taken by the television camera revealed an old, dry, cratered surface, with no canals, no vegetation, and no evidence of life whatsoever.  Indeed, it looked closer in appearance to the moon than to Earth.  To further disprove the contemporary theories, atmospheric measurements indicated that the surface pressure was at most a few millibars, and was composed almost entirely of carbon dioxide (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nIt was at this time that the idea of dust storms as the main form of weather on the planet first rose to prominence.  It was the only plausible explanation for the seasonal changes in albedo features, with the idea of liquid water and vegetation now all but debunked.  The images were not nearly detailed enough to image sand dunes, however, it was widely believed that the atmospheric dust was lifted by surface sand movement and saltation impacts (Goody, 1969).\\n\\nThe next probes sent to Mars, Mariner 6 and Mariner 7, would add detail to the planets surface (high-resolution imagery of about 10% of the planet’s surface), and confirm the atmospheric measurements made by Mariner 4.  By chance, they photographed no dust storms or dune fields, especially because only a few dozen images from these two probes were of high enough resolution.  However, they did capture images of frost in craters, as well as confirm that the ice caps were likely CO2 ice (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nThe next successful mission, Mariner 9, was also the first successful Mars orbiter.  In fall of 1971, it began returning images of a planet completely devoid of surface features.  After shutting down for a month to conserve power, it began returning images rich in detail, including craters, valleys, and, most importantly, sand dunes.  Mariner 9 was able to image most of the surface down to a resolution of 100 meters or so.  \\n\\nSince then, the resolution of images sent back from Mars has steadily improved.  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Viking orbiters imaged much of the planet down to a resolution of 40-90 meters, with many areas of interest imaged as well as 10-meter resolution.  The next Mars orbiter, the Mars Global Surveyor, arrived almost 20 years later in 1997.  It’s Mars Orbiter Camera imaged about 70% of the planet to better than 7-meter resolution in almost 10 years orbiting Mars.  Finally, the current Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera is imaging areas of interest with a resolution of 25-50 centimeters.\\n\\n11.	References\\n*Alghamdi, A. A. A. and Akyurt, M.

\\n<big>DATA BSE</big>\\n                       A database is an organized collection of data for one or more purposes, usually in digital form. The data are typically organized to model relevant aspects of reality (for example, the availability of rooms in hotels), in a way that supports processes requiring this information (for example, finding a hotel with vacancies). This definition is very general, and is independent of the technology used.\\nThe term "database" may be narrowed to specify particular aspects of organized collection of data and may refer to the logical database, to physical database as data content incomputer data storage or to many other database sub-definitions.\\nThe term database is correctly applied to the data and their supporting data structures, and not to the database management system (referred to by the acronym DBMS). The database data collection with DBMS is called a database system.\\nThe term database system implies that the data is managed to some level of quality (measured in terms of accuracy, availability, usability, and resilience) and this in turn often implies the use of a general-purpose database management system (DBMS).[1] A general-purpose DBMS is typically a complex software system that meets many usage requirements, and the databases that it maintains are often large and complex. The utilization of databases is now spread to such a wide degree that virtually every technology and product relies on databases and DBMSs for its development and commercialization, or even may have such embedded in it. Also, organizations and companies, from small to large, heavily depend on databases for their operations.
The Mumbai terrorist attacks struck India's tourism industry but it will be resilient and bounce back as it did post-September 2001. The present crisis presents an opportunity. There was an even bigger crisis in Indian tourism in 2001-02. The attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, war in Afghanistan, withdrawal of flights, attack on Parliament House in New Delhi and troop mobilisation on the India-Pakistan border meant that Indian hotels had just 20-25 per cent occupancy. International tour operators had removed India from their sale brochures and inbound Indian tour operators had switched to outbound operations.
