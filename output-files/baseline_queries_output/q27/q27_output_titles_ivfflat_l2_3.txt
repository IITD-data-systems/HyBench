A Physical Therapist Assistant is an allied healthcare professional, licensed to perform certain physical therapy procedures to assist the recovery of acutely or chronically ill or injured people, health maintenance of the healthy, and treatment of life-threatening conditions in a wide range of health care settings.\\n\\nThey often assist physical therapists in providing physical therapy treatments and procedures. They may, in accordance with State laws, assist in the development of treatment plans, carry out routine functions, document the progress of treatment, and modify specific treatments in accordance with patient status and within the scope of treatment plans established by a physical therapist. Generally, PTAs enter practice by first earning an Associates Degree (AAS) at an accredited institution, then become licensed by the state board upon successful passing of a standardized licensure examination.\\n\\nPhysical therapist assistants duties include: a) designing exercise programs and treatments that are within the plan of care proposed by the physical therapist b) training patients to use special equipment that will make life easier; c) applying equipment such as electrical stimulation and ultrasound which decrease pain and increase functions; and d) keeping records and reporting to the physical therapist on the patient's progress.\\n\\nPhysical therapist assistants work with all ages and are employed in a wide variety of settings, including hospitals, rehabilitation centers, pediatric facilities or school systems, private physical therapy clinics, home health care agencies, and extended care facilities.\\n\\nEducation
RE: Growth of Extinction\\n\\nMr. Lipuma,\\n\\nForests are large wooded areas which are primarily made up of trees that make up an ecosystem. There are several variations of forests and in general, these ecosystems are home to two-thirds of the planets species that inhabit land (Nature Conservancy).  Experts predict that species that exist in forests are becoming extinct at a rate 1000 times higher than natural factors.  As of 2010, 7.5 million acres of forest are lost to deforestation (Messanger, Stephen).  Forests not only provide habitats for the organisms living in them, but provide clean air and water for the rest of the world.\\n\\nThe existing definition of Forests on Wikipedia reads:\\n\\nA forest, also referred to as a wood or the woods, is an area with a high density of trees. As with cities, depending on various cultural definitions, what is considered a forest may vary significantly in size and have different classifications according to how and what of the forest is composed.[1][vague] These plant communities cover approximately 9.4 percent of the Earth's surface (or 30 percent of total land area), though they once covered much more (about 50 percent of total land area), in many different regions and function as habitats for organisms, hydrologic flow modulators, and soil conservers, constituting one of the most important aspects of the biosphere. Although forests are classified primarily by trees, the concept of a forest ecosystem includes additional species (such as smaller plants, fungi,[2] bacteria, and animals) as well as physical and chemical processes such as energy flow and nutrient cycling.\\n\\nA typical forest is composed of the overstory (canopy or upper tree layer) and the understory. The understory is further subdivided into the shrub layer, herb layer, and also the moss layer and soil microbes. In some complex forests, there is also a well-defined lower tree layer. Forests are central to all human life because they provide a diverse range of resources: they store carbon, aid in regulating the planetary climate, purify water and mitigate natural hazards such as floods. Forests also contain roughly 90 percent of the world's terrestrial biodiversity. \\n\\nThis existing definition gives you a general idea of what a forest is, but it lacks detail on their role in the environment. The definition in general lacks supporting information and references and the second paragraph does not transition to the first paragraph. The second paragraph should be an informative paragraph within the article, not the definition. To better re-write this definition, more statistics should be included to get an audience interested. I like the way that had included that today, “30% of total land area is covered by forest…” (Wikipedia) . This piece of information makes an audience continue to read because it is a fact not an assumption, but is not referenced.  After reading that, it makes me realize how much of the earth is covered by forest and wonder what happens if it disappears? I personally want to know the past and current status of forests. For example, if you try to look up Amelia Earhart  on Wikipedia, in the first paragraph the reader can immediately find that she was the first pilot to fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo and then she tried to fly across the Pacific Ocean and disappeared and her body was never recovered. After reading, I, the reader, want to know more information on how she got started in aviation, how she was able to fly across the Atlantic and not the Pacific, and the detail on her missing body. If the author(s) of the “Forest” article stated more facts immediately in the definition, the reader would continue to read. \\nIn efforts to improve the existing article, I have found additional sites and articles that appeal to the definition for improvement. Two thirds of the planets species that inhabit land live in forests.  This article is provided by the Nature Conservancy, an organization built to preserve forests. This site contains information on the conservation of forests, and how they reestablish, and protect them. It is obvious that the site is updated continuously because it contains features and new articles throughout. This organization also provides information on their purpose, where they can be contacted, and what the reader can do to help. This source keeps information relevant and up to date to keep the reader involved. \\nAn additional site, American Forests, is another conservation organization. They go into more detail of the importance of forests to air, water, climate, energy, wildlife, recreation, and people. For example, “The average healthy, mature tree produces roughly 260 pounds of oxygen annually. The average person consumes 386 pounds of oxygen per year. Two trees provide enough oxygen for one person per year” (American Forests) .  When you realize what two trees are capable of, you can only imagine what acres and acres can provide. Another source I found was an article that was displayed on an environmental interest website, or similar to a blog. The author of this site stated, “…3 million hectares (7.5 million acres) of forest loss per year…” (Messanger, Stephen) . A statistic like that does not imply the author’s opinion of the decrease in forests, but it gives the reader a sense of what is occurring today. This particular article was written in 2010, which could have been subjected to change over the past two years, but it also referrers to the number of forests being destroyed from 10 years prior and compares them.  \\n\\nI suggest that the information I have researched should be added the definition of Forest to Wikipedia. The statistics referred to in the above paragraphs had been referred from reputable organizations. They provide useful information on the importance of forest and their existing well being. Adding these facts to the definition will keep the reader interested because the author is stating the truth as opposed to making a observation or assumption. \\nIf acceptable, I would like to abide by Wikipedia rules, and help improve the existing definition to help readers better understand that forests are more than just a cluster of trees and what they contain before the article goes into the detail and the geography behind them.  I can be reached at my Wikipedia ID at laj-NJITWILL or by email at laj2@njit.edu.

A home inspection provides homeowners with knowledge about the current condition of their home. This process is very important when buying and selling a house. The inspection will define any defects the house may have, such as roofing, foundation, plumbing, pest infestations, heating and cooling, insulation, walls and floors. All homes have problems, but how serious are they? Inspections provide the answer. The purpose of inspections is to keep the property as safe as possible, but also to define the homes retail value. Home inspections are preformed by professionals to help a seller sell their home to a buyer that values safety.    \\n\\n\\nSources: homeinspection.com\\n         ourfamilyplace.com
== Ongoing Challenges ==\\nUtopia presents a fascinating instance of the set of problems, challenges and achievements that are entailed in the long search for a just integration of remote indigenous people into the Australian community. Its 30 year history is a record of 'self-determination' on a background of well developed communal will, strong participation, and an experience during the era of settlement which included some profitable relations with white pastoralists and some degree of continuous occupation. It's success, in mitigating the clinical disorders associated with transition to sedentary life, and minimising the advent of destructive behaviours and intoxicants; in maintaining a strong commitment to traditional practices and customs, and the ever present interest in the issue of identity in the face of coercive change, are impressive. Even so, the future of Utopia and places like it is problematic; the notion of integration itself the subject of contention; self determination is only effective inside a sphere of dependency that brings with it a plethora of social and political consequences. To many observers, the outstanding deficiency in remote communities is education, which provides its beneficiaries with capacities for choosing the terms of their own integration. It is of course, also a powerful integrative force itself, and so shifts the issue of cultural identity. The tensions due to these inevitable dilemmas are present at Utopia. The community is however in an unusually good position to resolve them, given time and a sympathetic administration.
Eliahi Priest,\\n\\nSeeks simple advanced and clean energy solutions for obvious reasons we are all aware of.\\n\\n\\nAfter only 2 or 3 generations of cultural madness, we now ALL bear a responsibility to at least 4,000 generations into the future.\\n \\n \\nSince the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the world has fallen into a madness of nuclear proliferation. While the nuclear power industry will proclaim its validity as a clean energy producer, it is clear that its only real intent is the plutonium extracted from spent uranium fuels that service the military agenda of nuclear warfare. Nuclear power as an energy source is an absurdity that only underlines the madness and irresponsibility of those who assume leadership in service of an oligarchic global hedgemony.\\n\\nNuclear power is profoundly harmful to all life. Not only that, but it is absurdly inneficient in its processes. After the mining, processing, and shipping of uranium, and the plant construction, maintenance, and deconstruction, a nuclear plant only produces about as much energy as went into it — not counting the need to store the only thing it actually produces (radioactive waste) for hundreds of thousands of years — and not counting the sacrifice of areas of the earth. Uranium has a half life of 4.5 billion years and as exposed radioactive waste causes lung cancer, bone cancer, and kidney failure. Radioactive waste is deadly for more than 240,000 years (9,600 generations), while deep underground storage facilities such as Onkalo in Norway, shudder at a 100,000 (4,000 generations) year forecast.\\n\\nUranium mining poisons miners and families by contaminating surrounding lands, scarce water supplies and the air they breathe. Most Uranium is mined from lands that indiginous cultures recognise as sacred with awareness of the uranium that is present. Kazakhstan is the worlds largest uranium miner, followed by Canada and Australia. In Kazakhstan soil erosion and water shortage are serious issues. In Canada and Australia (and the US)  dispute with first nation peoples has been intense over both uranium mining and nuclear waste repository sites.\\n\\nAn average nuclear plant produces 20-30 tons of high-level waste and 70 tons of low-level waste per year.  There already exists a very approximate level of 300,000 tons of high level nuclear waste that must be dealt with (250,000 tons in 2010 according to the documentary 'Into Eternity'). The amount of high level nuclear waste continues to increase as long as nuclear power generation is contiued. No proven long-term storage site exists.  If one ever does, we won’t know what language to post the warning signs in, as no human language has lasted a fraction of the time the nuclear waste will remain deadly. Confronted by this truth proposed 'Adaptive Phase Management' of nuclear waste means burying it and forgetting about it. Out of site out of mind is not a responsible attitude for dealing with extremely toxic nuclear waste.\\n\\nThe madness of the nuclear age must end NOW, and anyone who assumes any position of authority must address responsibility for the harm already created and recognise the new energy potentials that can deliver unlimited, non-harmful, non-polluting free energy, establishing an age of prosperity and abundance for all. Such solution is wholly aligned with the will of Gt. Spirit.\\n\\nSimples.
Statements like "the author [of a sci-fi/futuristic movie] has failed to envisage that the processes of fashion may continue into the far future" suggest that the author of this comment may be unaware of the fact that many science fiction works portray realities in which human and societal evolution have rendered fashion irrelevant.\\n\\nAnother point:\\n"There is typically little consideration in these visions of futuristic clothing that one-piece skin-tight garments might be unflattering to those with less than ideal body shapes, presumably because the author either assumes that the human body will have reached a state of athletic perfection through genetic engineering in the future, or -- again -- because of a failure of imagination."\\n\\nWhile many science fiction works do in fact portray a future where improved nutrition and health care result in increased longevity, health and relative "athletic perfection," there is still a third option: (presumably) intellectually advanced societies might not be so offended by the "unflattering" appearance of "those with less than ideal body shapes".
\\n'''Miss Africa New Jersey'''beauty pageant was established in 2011 to focus on the intelligence, culture, talents, and beauty of African women in New Jersey. This contest was carefully thought out, planned, and designed to help uplift and reward outstanding young African women. We believe this event can be used to help promote the empowerment of women and girls in various countries throughout Africa. In addition, it is our hope that we will be able to provide a great foundation for African women who are making changes in Africa through education; and also for those educating young African women to become strong and efficient role models as well. Sadly today, more and more young African women are making the wrong choices. Dropping out of school, getting involved with drugs, alcohol, crimes and experiencing motherhood at early ages are all problems facing today’s youth. Because women are the backbone of every nation, we believe this event has great potential to make major changes. They is a wise saying that “When you educate a woman, you educate a nation.
In the past, art forms of all types were respected in the highest regards. However, in our modern day high-tech society, we are consumed by the media and the ease of fast paced imagery. Photography, digital photography, and the endless array of digital media forms seem to tell the world that older forms of art such as painting are obsolete and unworthy of substantial recognition. It has often been said, “A picture is worth a thousand words,” which I would have to disagree with. In my mind, art forms such as painting are worth more than a photograph, and can have more meaning than,“a thousand words.” \\n\\nPhotography may be a more effective and reasonably inexpensive alternative to drawing or painting, but more thought and feeling goes into a painting than a photograph. Photography is relatively simple in comparison to painting, which is a much more complex task. With photography, the composition is already completely arranged, and with a painting the objective is much more open to interpretation by the artist. The artist has the ability to capture more emotion, understanding, and significance in an event and apply this fiery drive to his paintbrush when creating his own masterpiece.
In 2006, [http://savethechildren.net/alliance/index.html Save the Children]  launched its Rewrite the Future program to ensure that the millions of children unable to attend school because of war or conflict get access to quality education. '''Over 77 million''' children are growing up today without an education. '''32 million''' children are out of school in areas affected by war and conflict. '''Millions more''' living in conflict-affected countries are receiving a substandard education.\\n\\nYet education can bring protection and stability, and the potential to start building a more peaceful and prosperous society. \\n\\nIn areas of war and conflict, education is often among the first casualties. Schools close, teachers flee or are recruited into the military, and school systems are no longer funded. This puts children at risk, making them easier targets for recruitment as child soldiers, or exploitation as cheap labor. It also increases their vulnerability to trafficking and abuse.  \\n\\nSave the Children pledges to:\\n\\n* Ensure quality education for 8 million children: access to education for 3 million children and improved quality of education for these children and 5 million more. \\n* Work to make schools safe environments for protecting children affected by conflict. \\n* Influence national governments and international agencies to prioritize education at the onset of an emergency. \\n* Increase public and private funding for quality education for conflict- affected countries.\\n\\n==See also==\\n\\n* [[Save the Children]]
Beijing's Pollution Alarms Neighbors \\n\\nThe good news for the Chinese leadership is that their fiscal policies have paid off, producing both the world's second largest economy and the globe's leading creditor nation in less than a generation. \\n\\nThe less good news is that the country's hell-bent drive towards industrialization has brought in its train a host of collateral problems, not the least of which is pollution. Last month Beijing's air pollution soared past levels considered hazardous by the World Health Organization. \\n\\nPrior to that, the government often played down the pollution in Beijing, insisting it was merely fog, despite evidence to the contrary that was plain for all to see. Earlier this year, following public pressure resulting from hourly air-quality readings first published in 2011 by the U.S. embassy in Beijing, which Chinese authorities had previously denounced as "foreign interference," the municipal officials took notice. On 12 January the air-quality monitor operated by the U.S. embassy in Beijing recorded a Particulate Matter PM 2.5 level of 886 micrograms a cubic meter, nearly 35 times what the World Health Organization considers safe. \\n\\nHow bad? \\n\\nOn 5 February flights were grounded as visibility fell to around 200 meters across Beijing. Last month Beijing's Jiangong Hospital recorded a 30 percent spike in cases involving respiratory problems and the hospital's Emergency Department chief Cui Qifeng noted, "People tend to catch colds or suffer from lung infections during the days with heavily polluted air." \\n\\nAccording to a Chinese Academy of Engineering specialist in respiratory diseases, speaking about Beijing's current pollution levels, "It (the pollution) is more frightening than SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). For SARS, you can consider quarantine and other means. But no one can escape from the air pollution and indoor pollution." The six-month SARS epidemic in 2003 killed 775 people in 25 countries. \\n\\nCauses? \\n\\nBeijing alone now has five million cars choking the streets, spewing their exhaust into the air. More importantly, the nation's pollution problems are caused by China developing at a speed and scale unprecedented in history, which has produced widespread environmental degradation that the central authorities have been slow to acknowledge. Aside from vehicle exhaust, thermal energy plants utilizing the nation's poor grade coal power the country's factories, providing the heat for hundreds of millions of homes even as they belch toxins into the atmosphere. \\n\\nAnd the toxic air threatens to become an international issue as well. Drifting across the Sea of Japan, the smog is now impacting parts of Japan, with the Japanese Ministry of the Environment's website on 5 February being overloaded. One ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity said, "Access to our air-pollution monitoring system has been almost impossible since last week, and the telephone here has been constantly ringing because worried people keep asking us about the impact on health." \\n\\nWhile the Japanese government remained discreet about air quality issues, Ministry of the Environment official Yasushi Nakajima was more blunt, stating, "We can't deny there is an impact from pollution in China." According to National Institute for Environmental Studies researcher Atsushi Shimizu, the prevailing winds from the west carry air pollution over western Japan. The pollution from China has exceeded government limits for particulate matter, which government concern focusing on particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter, whose concentration has been reported as high as 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air in northern Kyushu. The Japanese government limit is 35 micrograms. \\n\\nSolutions? \\n\\nResponding to the recent crisis, Beijing's city government ordered 103 heavily polluting factories to suspend production and told government departments and state-owned enterprises to reduce their use of cars by a third. \\n\\nMore immediately, on 6 Feb. the Chinese government issued a timetable for its program to upgrade fuel quality, aiming to implement a strict standard nationwide by 2017, upgrading its standard V for automobile petrol, with sulfur content within 10 parts per million before the end of the year. \\n\\nBut the country's long term solutions will not be inexpensive  reducing the use of coal, forcing cars to use efficient pollution exhaust equipment, and developing mass transit options to reduce the country's rising love affair with the automobile. \\n\\nChina now has the wealth to implement such solutions whether the political will is there is quite another matter. Should authorities not act, then they'd better ramp up the country's health insurance policies, as undoubtedly more and more workers will be reporting sick days. \\n\\nSource: http://www.indepthexploration.com\\n\\nSource: http://oilprice.com/The-Environment/Global-Warming/Chinas-Smog-Becoming-an-International-Issue.html \\n\\nBy.

Coming from a professional background of film and television, my interests gradually shifted to philosophy. Now I am interested in using the internet as a platform to develop a new global value-based thinking to serve as ground for a harmoniously dynamic world, interconnected on the basis of naturally emerging bonds, rather than artificially implemented ideologies and coercive policies. Such a model can only be based on one thing: the primacy of values and the valuing subject. \\n\\nStill interested in making film I aim to combine the two - film and philosophy - more and more in the future. But my present objective is to create on the internet an effective thinking platform for 21st century thought, in which the rational animal finally sheds its last superstitions: the dogmatic belief in a one and only truth, be it scientific objectivity, God, or any other type of absolutist ethics. I believe that the time has come for humanity to conquer the fear of being fully responsible for what it is.\\n\\nMy philosophy has been developed so far under the term "value ontology".
{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n'''Introduction to Mining''''''Bold text'''\\nEvery living organism on earth survives by consuming resources found in its immediate environment; it is either prey or predator. From cradle to grave man is dependent on resources from the environment for shelter and sustenance. For sustenance, nutrition and nourishment these resources can be obtained from two sources, harvesting living organisms for food, either through a hunter-gathering nomadic existence or a settled pastoral crop-growing usually coupled with animal husbandry life-style. For shelter and hand implements, man turns to the minerals, metals, soils and gravels that are encountered on earth. Mining is the study of obtaining inorganic minerals, metals, and carbonic fuels from the solid portion of the surface crust of the earth in an organised manner and on an industrial scale to satisfy the need of man to survive on the hostile environment of the planet.
Drunk driving is the act of operating and/or driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs to the degree that mental and motor skills are impaired. It is illegal in all jurisdictions within the U.S. The specific criminal offense is usually called driving under the influence [of alcohol and/or other drugs] (DUI), and in some states driving while intoxicated (DWI), operating while impaired (OWI), or operating a vehicle under the influence (OVI). Such laws may also apply to boating or piloting aircraft.\\n\\nIn the United States the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that 17,941 people died in 2006 in "alcohol-related" collisions, representing 41 percent of total traffic deaths in the US. Over 500,000 people were injured in alcohol-related accidents in the US in 2003. NHTSA defines fatal collisions as "alcohol-related" if they believe the driver, a passenger, or a nonoccupant of the vehicle (such as a pedestrian or pedalcyclist) had a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.01 or greater. NHTSA defines nonfatal collisions as "alcohol-related" if the accident report indicates evidence of alcohol present. NHTSA specifically notes that "alcohol-related" does not necessarily mean a driver or nonoccupant was tested for alcohol and that the term does not indicate a collision or fatality was caused by the presence of alcohol.[1] On average, about 60 percent of the BAC values are missing or unknown. To analyze what they believe is the complete data, statisticians simulate BAC information.\\n[http://www.legalx.net California DUI]
'''Virtual Surgery'''\\n\\nVirtual reality is a computer generated technology which allows information to be displayed in a simulated environment. Over the past decade virtual reality and computer simulation have expanded into other domains including the medical field.\\nVirtual reality is perhaps being used more in Medicine than in any other industry, because its applications have such far-reaching benefits. It promises to bring one of the most dramatic changes to the practice of medicine over the next decade.\\nIn Surgical training there is often a short fall in the number of desired operations performed. One consequence is that trainees may have less practice and feel less confident about many surgical procedures and techniques. With the increasing level of difficulty of surgical procedures it has become imperative that trainees have an arena in which to learn their trade that is forgiving. With the advent of Virtual reality, this has become a reality. \\nAt the present there are many applications of virtual reality in Medicine\\n•	Education - VR is used to create an environment for learning anatomy where exercises can be easily reversed.\\n•	Simulation for Surgical training -VR can teach surgeons new procedures and determine their level of competence before they operate on patients. It allows the trainee to practise a skill several times as a refresher course. \\n•	Project Hippocrates: VR is used to simulate, plan and execute Orthopaedic surgeries. The goal of this system is to allow the surgeons to simulate operations and then alter their approach to them based on the results of the simulated surgical procedure. The program allows the surgeon to plan his or her surgery.\\n•	Telemedicine: Telemedicine is a system of electronically communicating data from one site to a distant site for the purpose of medical diagnosis, patient care and as a medium for delivering medical services over long distances.
What is spatial opacity?\\n\\nSpatial opacity is a geographical term who leads with any type of obstacles who are found in space. Spatial opacity is everywhere an can have multiple characteristics, whether it is natural (hills, mountains, lakes, seas and so on) or not natural (traffic lights, intersections, doors and so on). Spatial opacity is everything that stops or interrupts any type of flows who are related to space.\\n\\n\\nMASDA \\n\\nCourses:\\n\\nThe main input from the courses is a very theoretical overview of the material. Depending on the subject, you may get some applied examples on how the theory matches real examples. \\nThe courses include a lot of training in statistics as well as approaches to spatial planning with computer support (GIS). All courses are presented with Powerpoint support and in the English language. \\nMany courses treat various policy issues on spatial planning of the European Union as well as political issues within the different EU Member States. In addition to that, there are some courses about sustainability in terms of spatial planning. \\nMost of the courses are related to the European Union and do not necessarily treat spatial planning of non-EU member States.
'''The Problem of Global Warming'''\\n\\nWe face many environmental challenges that pose a risk to the well-being of life on earth. Many scientists would agree that at the forefront of these issues stands global warming. Global warming poses a multitude of problems that threaten us. Not only are the issues of global warming risks to our health, they are also potential dangers to the entire planet and every living creature that dwells on it. If we truly want to resolve global warming, we must establish a comprehensive strategy that addresses a way of preserving the world for the future.\\n\\n'''The effects of Global Warming and how Mankind Contributes to Our Problem'''\\n\\nBecause of our careless and reckless disregard for the Earth, some nasty effects of global warming are all too common. These include things like: diseases spreading, the potentially destructive melting of the polar ice caps which could result in the disastrous flooding of the Earth, and the diminishing of the protective layers of the atmosphere. It may also be connected with causing allergies to become more severe. According to an article in the August 17, 2000 edition of the New York Times, pollen levels may rise as carbon dioxide levels are increasing. This happens because the more carbon dioxide there is in the air, plant growth is accelerated. \\n\\n'''What We Can Do to Make a Positive Change'''\\n\\nAs an environmentalist who enjoys experiencing nature and capturing its beauty in photography, I am alarmed by the fact that the United States is contributing the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The appropriate plan to act on global warming is to treat Mother Earth with more consideration by driving less, controlling the population from reaching a level the world does not have the resources or space to sustain, and recycling and planting trees. If we were to collectively do this, we would do much to help with global warming. \\n\\n'''An Explanation of How These Environmentalist Ideas Would Help'''\\n\\nActing on these ideas I have presented would help in different but significant ways. If we were to walk to the store, instead of driving, we would be releasing less carbon fumes into the air, which would result in preserving the diminishing layers of the atmosphere. If we were to control the population from becoming even more crowded than it already is, we would not need to burn down our forests and destroy nature to make room for the incoming population. Recycling and planting trees promotes a healthy environment by allowing us to save valuable and fleeting resources, and by planting trees, we are letting plants release more oxygen into the atmosphere which makes a difference with global warming by balancing the levels of oxygen and carbon.\\n\\n'''Final Note'''\\n\\nIt is time to finally treat Mother Earth with the respect she deserves and truly needs for us to continue living on this planet. We’ve also victimized plants and animals by ruthlessly destroying their habitat, and by threatening species of animals and plants into extinction. Animals and plants have just as much right as humans to live hospitably in an environment where they can thrive, without humans ruining their terrain. My hope is to motivate even a few readers of the **** ****** to preserve the earth, and to speak out against people polluting Mother Earth. The sooner we realize this, the better off humanity will be.
The Mold problem and the human bio-toxin pathway\\n\\n\\nMolds are everywhere! \\nThey are the largest biomass on the planet and are constantly at work breaking down biodegradeables every minute of everyday. They are in the air we breath, indoors and outdoors, and are usually not causing problems with humans. \\n\\nThat is, until they invade our homes or place of business! \\nRemember,moisture follows gravity and molds follow moisture...EVERY TIME! When a moisture problem occurrs, such as a roofing leak, flood, or even when the air system is shut-off in a humid environment, molds will begin to grow and colonize almost anywhere on almost any organic material. They can even grow on plastic and metal and other materials normally concidered safe from fungal invasion when dirt or other organic build-up exists.\\n\\nWhen molds invade our indoor environments, the amount of airborne mold spores is amplified to a much more dangerous level than we are normally exposed to, which can cause severe health effects and reactions in humans. \\nThe majority of these health effects are caused by the toxins that molds create to protect their spores or "babies". These toxins are chemical compounds that are attached to the spores to protect them from their natural predators, like germs, insects and bacteria. \\n\\nWhen most of us breathe in airborne mold spores, our bodies can recognize the intruders and can normally produce anti-bodies to destroy them and remove them from the body. \\nBut nearly 25% of humans have been found to have an irregular HLA-DR gene, and this is the gene that controls the immune response system in the body. Normally one or two people will suffer far more health problems than the rest of the inhabitants, who normally feel that the others are "over-reacting or paranoid".

This is an updated and edited version of Robin Marris' classicThe Economic Theory of Managerial Capitalism (1964). This was widely recognized as pathbreaking as it was the first attempt by a professional economist to make a formal theory of the behavior and growth of a large-scale "managerial" corporation based on a realistic assessment of the sociological and institutional environment. The model determined the long run growth rates of individual firms on the basis of the financial and market environment on the one hand, and the needs, interest and aspirations of both managers and shareholders on the other. Managers in particular were shown to trade desire for growth against fear of takeover. These then novel important features of modern capitalism--mergers, takeovers and executive bonuses and the relationship between the growth of firms and the growth of the economy--have become increasingly topical. The new book contains the original introduction along with reworked and updated coverage of the theoretical model, along with completely new chapters both of micro-theory and assessing and responding to the debate which the book created.

They lack close friends due to the isolation they have adapted to. Some examples of what socially isolating yourself can mean are staying home, having no communication with anyone including friend and family, and basically avoiding any contact with other beings. If there is any social contact with another social species then it is most likely concise. Emotional or psychological challenges are the results of social isolation.  These results can cause symptoms of feeling depressed, distress, or anxious. This causes feelings of loneliness, fear of others, or negative self-esteem. \\n\\n\\nSocial isolation is common among early adulthood. Some cases of this isolation can get extreme. Clear boundaries are more characterized when the ego part of the personality is fully developing. This personality component that Sigmund Freud proposed is defined as a idea of a person's self physically and mentally. Independence gives a sense of disconnection from others. During this time of development, a person may become more preoccupied with feelings and thoughts of their individuality that are not easy to share with other individuals. This can be a result from feelings of shame, guilt, or alienation during childhood experiences.
Beware of food-borne diseases this summer\\nBy EDUARDO GONZALES, MD\\nMarch 30, 2009, 12:16pm\\nQ. Is it true that food-borne diseases are more common during summer? If so, why? Can you enumerate these diseases? How can we prevent them? -- Myrna M., Los Banos, Laguna \\n\\nA. Yes, the incidence of food-borne diseases peaks during summer. This is primarily because most food-borne pathogens (i.e., disease-causing microorganisms) grow fastest in warm and humid weather. Furthermore, people do more cooking and eating outdoors (i.e., picnics, barbecues, campings) during summer, which means they do without the safety facilities that their houses provide such as refrigeration and proper washing. \\n\\nThe list of diseases caused by pathogens or their toxins (poisons) that are transmitted through the intake of contaminated food and water is a long one. Most of these diseases affect the gastro-intestinal tract, but some affect other organs, too.  Food-borne pathogens include viruses such as the hepatitis A virus; bacteria such as those that cause food poisoning and various forms of gastroenteritis, cholera, typhoid fever and botulism; protozoa such as E. histolytica, the causative agent of amebiasis; and, other parasites such as ascaris, other roundworms and tapeworms.\\n\\nAny food item can be contaminated by pathogens and toxins. The contamination can occur during production, processing, distribution, preparation or storage of food. \\n\\nContamination of food with disease-causing agents can occur in the farm. For example, tapeworms which humans acquire when they eat raw or half-cooked meat find their way into pork or beef when cattle and pigs ingest the eggs of these worms while grazing. Another example, amoeba and the hepatitis A virus contaminate vegetables if plants are fertilized with night soil or watered with water from sewage canals (two common practices in the Philippines). \\n\\nFood processing plants that do not comply with standard health safety procedures are also occasional sources of pathogens in food products. But very often, food-borne illnesses are caused by improper handling and preparation of food at home.  \\n\\nFood-borne diseases, without exception, are preventable. Most can be prevented by simply observing the following measures:\\n\\n* Buy and consume only food (either raw or processed) that complies with safety standards.\\n* Cook food thoroughly. In particular, meat should not be eaten raw.\\n* Thoroughly wash with flowing water fruits and vegetables that are to be eaten raw.  This will not totally eliminate pathogens, but their number can be significantly reduced for the body’s other defenses to take care of.\\n* Wash food items for cooking before chopping or cutting.\\n* Wash with soap and water all utensils, chopping boards and kitchen areas before preparing meals.\\n* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing, eating and handling food.\\n* Eat cooked food within 1-2 hours after cooking. \\n* Refrigerate leftovers within 1-2 hours. \\n* Re-heat leftovers thoroughly before eating.\\n* Do not allow contact or mixing of raw and cooked foods.  \\n* Protect food from rodents, cockroaches, flies and other insects.\\n* Consume milk only if it has been pasteurized.\\n* Ensure that your drinking water is safe.\\n* When going for outings, keep perishable food like cooked meats, potato salads, etc. in an insulated cooler that is packed with ice. Do the same for raw meat, poultry and vegetables, but in a separate cooler.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that may develop two to three weeks after a Group A streptococcal infection (such as strep throat or scarlet fever). It is believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity and can involve the heart, joints, skin, and brain[1]. Acute rheumatic fever commonly appears in children between ages 5 and 15, with only 20% of first time attacks occurring in adults[1].\\n\\nIt gets its name for its similarity in presentation to rheumatism.[2]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Diagnosis\\n \\nRheumatic heart disease at autopsy with characteristic findings (thickened mitral valve, thickened chordae tendineae, hypertrophied left ventricular myocardium).Modified Jones criteria were first published in 1944 by T. Duckett Jones, MD.[3] They have been periodically revised by the American Heart Association in collaboration with other groups.[4] According to revised Jones criteria, the diagnosis of rheumatic fever can be made when two of the major criteria, or one major criterion plus two minor criteria, are present along with evidence of streptococcal infection. Exceptions are chorea and indolent carditis, each of which by itself can indicate rheumatic fever. [5][6][7]\\n\\n[edit] Major criteria\\nMigratory polyarthritis: a temporary migrating inflammation of the large joints, usually starting in the legs and migrating upwards. \\nCarditis: inflammation of the heart muscle which can manifest as congestive heart failure with shortness of breath, pericarditis with a rub, or a new heart murmur. \\nSubcutaneous nodules: painless, firm collections of collagen fibers over bones or tendons. They commonly appear on the back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees. \\nErythema marginatum: a long lasting rash that begins on the trunk or arms as macules and spreads outward to form a snake like ring while clearing in the middle. This rash never starts on the face and it is made worse with heat. \\nSydenham's chorea (St. Vitus' dance): a characteristic series of rapid movements without purpose of the face and arms. This can occur very late in the disease. \\n[edit] Minor criteria\\nFever \\nArthralgia: Joint pain without swelling \\nRaised Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C reactive protein \\nLeukocytosis \\nECG showing features of heart block, such as a prolonged PR interval[8] \\nSupporting evidence of Streptococcal infection: elevated or rising Antistreptolysin O titre or DNAase.[1]. \\nPrevious episode of rheumatic fever or inactive heart disease \\n[edit] Other signs and symptoms\\nAbdominal pain \\nNose bleeds \\n[edit] Pathophysiology\\nRheumatic fever is a systemic disease affecting the peri-arteriolar connective tissue and can occur after an untreated Group A Beta hemolytic streptococcal pharyngeal infection. It is believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity. This cross-reactivity is a Type II hypersensitivity reaction and is termed molecular mimicry. Usually, self reactive B cells remain anergic in the periphery without T cell co-stimulation. During a Strep. infection, mature antigen presenting cells such as B cells present the bacterial antigen to CD4-T cells which differentiate into helper T2 cells. Helper T2 cells subsequently activate the B cells to become plasma cells and induce the production of antibodies against the cell wall of Streptococcus. However the antibodies may also react against the myocardium and joints[9], producing the symptoms of rheumatic fever.\\n\\nGroup A streptococcus pyogenes has a cell wall composed of branched polymers which sometimes contain "M proteins" that are highly antigenic. The antibodies which the immune system generates against the "M proteins" may cross react with cardiac myofiber protein myosin[10],heart muscle glycogen and smooth muscle cells of arteries, inducing cytokine release and tissue destruction. However, the only proven cross reaction is with perivascular connective tissue.[citation needed] This inflammation occurs through direct attachment of complement and Fc receptor-mediated recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. Characteristic Aschoff bodies, composed of swollen eosinophilic collagen surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages can be seen on light microscopy. The larger macrophages may become Aschoff giant cells. Acute rheumatic valvular lesions may also involve a cell-mediated immunity reaction as these lesions predominantly contain T-helper cells and macrophages.[11]\\n\\nIn acute RF, these lesions can be found in any layer of the heart and is hence called pancarditis. The inflammation may cause a serofibrinous pericardial exudates described as “bread-and-butter” pericarditis, which usually resolves without sequelae. Involvement of the endocardium typically results in fibrinoid necrosis and verrucae formation along the lines of closure of the left-sided heart valves. Warty projections arise from the deposition, while subendothelial lesions may induce irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques.\\n\\nChronic rheumatic heart disease is characterized by repeated inflammation with fibrinous resolution. The cardinal anatomic changes of the valve include leaflet thickening, commissural fusion and shortening and thickening of the tendinous cords. [11]\\n\\n[edit] Treatment\\nThe management of acute rheumatic fever is geared toward the reduction of inflammation with anti-inflammatory medications such as aspirin or corticosteroids. Individuals with positive cultures for strep throat should also be treated with antibiotics. Aspirin is the drug of choice and should be given at high doses of 100 mg/kg/day. One should watch for side effects like gastritis, salicylate poisoning etc. Steroids are reserved for cases where there is evidence of involvement of heart. The use of steroids may prevent further scarring of tissue and may prevent development of sequelae such as Mitral stenosis. Monthly injections of Longacting Penicillin must be given for a period of 5 years in patients having one attack of Rheumatic fever. If there is evidence of carditis, the length of Penidure therapy may be up to 40 years. Another important cornerstone in treating rheumatic fever includes the continual use of low dose antibiotics (such as penicillin, sulfadiazine, or erythromycin) to prevent recurrence.\\n\\n[edit] Infection\\nPatients with positive cultures for Streptococcus pyogenes should be treated with penicillin as long as allergy is not present. This treatment will not alter the course of the acute disease.\\n\\n[edit] Inflammation\\nPatients with significant symptoms may require corticosteroids. Salicylates are useful for pain.\\n\\n[edit] Heart failure\\nSome patients develop significant carditis which manifests as congestive heart failure. This requires the usual treatment for heart failure: diuretics and digoxin. Unlike normal heart failure, rheumatic heart failure responds well to corticosteroids.\\n\\n[edit] Prevention\\nPrevention of recurrence is achieved by eradicating the acute infection and prophylaxis with antibiotics. The American Heart Association recommends daily or monthly prophylaxis continue long-term, perhaps for life.[12]\\n\\nScreening school-aged children for sore throats also aid in prevention.\\n\\n[edit] Epidemiology\\n \\nDisability-adjusted life year for rheumatic heart disease per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.[13] \\n     no data\\n \\n     less than 20\\n \\n     20-40\\n \\n     40-60\\n \\n     60-80\\n \\n     80-100\\n \\n     100-120\\n \\n     120-140\\n \\n     140-160\\n \\n     160-180\\n \\n     180-200\\n \\n     200-330\\n \\n     more than 330Rheumatic fever is common worldwide and responsible for many cases of damaged heart valves. In Western countries, it became fairly rare since the 1960s, probably due to widespread use of antibiotics to treat streptococcus infections. While it is far less common in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century, there have been a few outbreaks since the 1980s. Although the disease seldom occurs, it is serious and has a mortality of 2–5%.[14]\\n\\nRheumatic fever primarily affects children between ages 5 and 15 years and occurs approximately 20 days after strep throat or scarlet fever. In up to a third of cases, the underlying strep infection may not have caused any symptoms.\\n\\nThe rate of development of rheumatic fever in individuals with untreated strep infection is estimated to be 3%. The incidence of recurrence with a subsequent untreated infection is substantially greater (about 50%).[15] The rate of development is far lower in individuals who have received antibiotic treatment. Persons who have suffered a case of rheumatic fever have a tendency to develop flare-ups with repeated strep infections.\\n\\nThe recurrence of rheumatic fever is relatively common in the absence of maintenance of low dose antibiotics, especially during the first three to five years after the first episode. Heart complications may be long-term and severe, particularly if valves are involved.\\n\\nSurvivors of Rheumatic fever often have to take penicillin to prevent streptococcal infection which could possibly lead to another case of Rheumatic fever that could prove fatal.
Why Donate Blood ?\\n\\nBlood is the living fluid that all life is based on.\\nBlood is composed of 60% liquid part and 40% solid part. The liquid part called Plasma, made up of 90% water and 10% nutrients, hormones, etc. is easily replenished by food, medicines, etc.\\nBut the solid part that contains RBC (red blood cells), WBC (white blood cells) and Platelets take valuable time to be replaced if lost.\\nThis is where you come in. The time taken by a patient's body to replace it could cost his/her life. Sometimes the body might not be in a condition to replace it at all.\\nAs you know blood cannot be harvested it can only be donated. This means only you can save a life that needs blood.\\nEvery year India requires 40 million units of 250cc blood out of which only a meager 500,000 of blood units are available. Saving a life does not require heroic deeds.\\nYou could just do it with a small thought and an even smaller effort by saying "yes".

These impacts arise not only from raw materials and component purchases, supplier manufacturing processes or logistics aarangements, but can also include final product disposal and even the siting of supplier plants. Given the strategic importance and the scale of organisational buying, a range of possibilities for environmental initiatives exist in the supply chain. These begin with the product, component or raw material to be purchased, where the buying company could stipulate minimum standards that the purchased product has to fulfil.\\nFor example, a paper-maker can insist the woodpulb in buys conforms to recognised standards of forest management rather than being made from clear-cutting an entire forest, or an electronic company can require its supplier to avoid certain harmful heavy metals in the supplied products. Other product based environmental initiatives can aim at by products of supplied input such as recycling packaging or reducing waste.
'''Taiko Fujimura''' is a mixed media artist based in San Francisco. Working with wood, paints, plexiglas, mirrors and found objects, she creates conceptual two- and three-dimensional collage and assemblage works as well as paintings on wood, canvas, rice paper, and several types of archival papers. Her three-dimensional work is designed to invite the viewer to interact with each piece to discover his or her personal aesthetic within the microcosm of what Taiko presents as the broader representation of beauty.\\n\\nTaiko selects materials that link her inner self with the outside world, creating an extended montage of her personal experiences, connections and relationships with both people and objects. Her pieces confront the dichotomies between chaos and order, industrial and organic, mind and body, positive and negative, logical and random, and intuitive and sequential. She feels an understanding of dualism is key to her art. Her pieces seek to bridge the contradictions around us by unifying space.\\n\\nThe concepts she explores include quietude, peacefulness, harmony, unity, and universality. Her work is strongly influenced by Japanese wabi-sabi, an aesthetic system she strongly believes to be "beautiful" art and Japanese calligraphy, which she studied since age six.

{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\nThe debilitating effects of climate change seem to lead to medical impacts that affect a significant amount of people, particularly poor individuals and children.  With the gradual worsening of climate change, Asthma is a serious chronic illness that is currently on the rise.  Approximately 20 million Americans are inflicted with asthma.  According to the Environmental Defense Fund, more than “4,000 die every year from the disease, which also causes some 1.8 million emergency room visits” (EmergencyDefenseFundOnline).  Why, in recent years, has asthma symptoms become more prevalent?  Who is most vulnerable to its effects?  How does global climate change come into play?  \\n	Beginning with defining asthma and what it does to the body, the reader can better understand asthma as a chronic illness that “constricts airways and makes them swollen, filling with mucus. Your chest feels tight -- you may cough or wheeze -- and you just can't seem to catch your breath. In severe cases, asthma attacks can be deadly” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Furthermore, the Natural Resources Defense Council found that asthma kills approximately “5,000 people every year in America” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  It has been proven that people residing in poorer areas, with little sanitation, and both young children, and the elderly, are vulnerable subgroups to climate change and its effects on asthma.  \\n	Beginning with the world’s poorest populations, the Practical Action organization found that the world’s poorest people are the hardest hit by climate change due to devastating droughts, floods, and other weather events (PracticalActionOnline).  Furthermore, Practical Action proclaims that there is a massive injustice present since “climate change is caused by the world’s richest countries” (PracticalActionOnline).  Since poor countries lack the financial means and strong voice to rise up against rich countries’ plans, which may have a debilitating effect on the earth’s environment, and further leads to climate change and the influx of asthmatic symptoms, these poor nations bear the burden of climate change.  \\n	According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the persistence of certain diseases, such as asthma, depend largely on climate change (EPAOnline).  The extreme temperature changes that we have experienced cause a great loss of life, particularly on the elderly.  Additionally, the extreme high temperature changes can “increase air and water pollution, which in turn harm human health” (EPAOnline).  Furthermore, the EPA explains that “climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can indirectly impact the incidence of serious infectious diseases” (EPAOnline).  \\nIt is important to note that the “extent and nature of climate change impacts on human health vary by region, by relative vulnerability of population groups, by the extent and duration of exposure to climate change itself and by society’s ability to adapt to or cope with the change” (EPAOnline).  By being exposed to these extreme climate changes, people are more inclined to contract diseases, such as asthma.  Climate change is expected to contribute to some air quality problems.  \\n	 Respiratory disorders, such as asthma, are more prevalent as the climate changes in extreme manners.  The four main air pollutants that trigger asthma are as follows: Ground Level Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide, Particulate Matter, and Nitrogen Oxide.  Beginning with Ground Level Ozone, it is a “toxic component of smog…that is produced at ground level when tailpipe pollution from cars and trucks reacts with oxygen and sunlight” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Ground level ozone is most common in city-like environments.  People living in cities, which are known to be less sanitary than suburban areas, are predominantly poor and thus lack the means to move to areas with better air quality.  The cities are filled with buses and cars emitting harmful gases into the air and thus harming people in the near surroundings. \\n	Sulfur Dioxide is a “respiratory irritant…that is produced when coal and crude oil are burned” ( NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  As mentioned previously, cities are filled with objects emitting harmful gases into the air, and sulfur dioxide is quite prevalent in city-like living areas.  Sulfur Dioxide is emitted from coal-fired power plants.  Unfortunately, “one in five Americans lives within 10 miles of a coal-fired power plant” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  The fact that so many Americans live in such a close proximity of the coal-fired power plants goes to show that poor people do not have a great advantage at living in sufficient living conditions.\\n	Particulate matters are tiny particles in the air.  They come from a wide range of pollutants, such as dust, soot, and diesel exhaust particles (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  If these small particles are suspended from the air and into the lungs, then an asthma symptom can be triggered; thus affecting the asthmatic.  Approximately, “81 million people live in areas that fail to meet national air quality standards for particulate matter” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Coal-fired power plants and diesel vehicles are major emitters of particulate matter and thus further prove that people residing in poor living conditions are affected more than people living in more affluent areas.\\n	Finally, Nitrogen Oxide is a “gas emitted from tailpipes and power plants…it contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone and smog” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Furthermore, Nitrogen Oxide, when mixed with other air pollutants, form small particles that can trigger asthma.
Unknown to many people, bananas have historical societal significance. Bananas have been known to help reduce the symptoms and pains of PMS in females. They are ripe when they are spotted brown- not when they are green or nearly fully brown. Their consumption can assist concentration and focus by healing some stress and keeping eyesight healthy. Banana peels can heal warts when the inner part of the peel is placed on the skin. They are a rich source of fiber and many other essential nutrients and vitamins. Presently there are various examples in the public realm that highlight the importance of bananas. Here are just a few of those examples: the children's show "Bananas in Pajamas," the banana slug as the mascot for the University of California at Santa Cruz, an online networking portal named "Broadband Bananas," and the Washington Banana Museum.
== Herpes ==\\nHerpes is a viral infection disease causing small painful blisters and inflammation, most commonly at the junction of skin and mucous membrane in the mouth or nose or in the genitals areas. It is more common in women than in men possibly because male to female transmission is more efficient than female to male transmission. Oral herpes causes cold sores around the mouth or face. Genital herpes affects the genitals, buttocks or anal area. The virus can spread even when sores are not present. Mothers can also infect their babies during childbirth. Some people have no symptoms. Others get sores near the area where the virus has entered the body. They turn into blisters, become itchy and painful, and then heal. The virus can be dangerous in newborn babies or in people with weak immune systems. \\n           Most people have outbreaks several times a year. Over time, you get them less often. Medicines to help your body fight the virus can help lessen symptoms and decrease outbreaks. Correct usage of latex condoms can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading herpes. Most people get Herpes Simplex Virus type - 1 infections, which cause cold sores, during infancy or childhood. They usually get it from close contact with family members or friends who carry the virus. It can be transmitted by kissing, sharing eating utensils, or by sharing towels. The sores most commonly affect the lips, mouth, nose, chin, or cheeks and occur shortly after exposure. Patients may barely notice any symptoms or find these sores annoying and seek medical attention. Most people get Herpes Simplex Virus type - 2 infections, which cause genital sores, following sexual contact with an infected person. The virus affects anywhere between five and twenty million people, up to 20% of all sexually active adults in the United States.\\nThe lesions of both types of herpes simplex can be spread by touching an unaffected part of the body immediately after touching a herpes lesion.
== Environment ==\\n\\n''ENVIRONMENT''\\nThe Environment The impact of people on their environment can be devastating. This is where the respective role of governments can make decisions that shape environmental policy and responsibilities. These governments can be broken up into four different levels: local, state, federal and international. Air quality and biodiversity are two current issues that can be related to the role of governments. Global warming is also another implication that has a devastating effect on the environment. Current examples include the rise in sea levels, polar meltdowns, the melting of ice sheets and glaciers and human deaths due to disease from the effects of global warming. Firstly the environment can be defined as the natural features of our surroundings such as plant and animal life and their habitats, water, soils and the atmosphere. A local government named Rockdale Municipal Council has implemented certain actions to deal with the quality in that region. They have recognized that the main source of poor air quality originates from air pollution sources such as motor vehicles, industrial premises and aircraft emissions. The solutions to these problems include improvements to Ryde and Botany Bay cycle way, integration of land use and transport planning strategies, production of Air Quality - the Facts booklet for community, investigation of complaints regarding odours and dust, tree planting and preparation of a Local Air Quality Management Plan in 1999. Air quality is a major issue in most states within Australia that affects our greenhouse, to tackle the implications state governments have created policies and responsibilities. For instance Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) is a program that enables mainly state governments to take action on greenhouse. CCP provides these state governments with a strategic framework to diminish greenhouse gas emissions by helping them identify and recognize the emissions of their council and community, set a reduction goal and develop and utilize an action plan to reach that goal. State actions include: capturing the methane from landfill sites and public and non-car transport into urban planning. On a federal or national basis Australia has employed policies to increase the air quality. For example the Commonwealth Government will guarantee that Australia carries its fair-share of the burden in worldwide efforts to combat global air pollution through policy development and implementation. They have also supported the National Greenhouse Strategy (NGS) which began in late 1996. The government will also support the development of a national strategy to observe and manage air toxics. The air toxics strategy will monitor, establish the levels of community exposure to, and manage emissions of selected air toxics. The federal government will even consider the inclusion of air toxics in a future National Environmental Protection Measure. Further measures include the leading of the development of national ambient air quality standards through the National Environmental Protection Council and the assistance of the establishment of a National Pollutant Inventory which will require large companies to publicly report their emission of 90 pollutants. Local government Rockdale Municipal Council has introduced responsibilities and policies to reduce the loss of biodiversity. This local government has learned that the cause involves the introduction of species, pollution of land and water, weed invasion and urban encroachment. Their solutions to these problems comprise of the planting of over 3,500 plants and shrubs in Bardwell Valley and Scotts Reserve, bush regeneration and planting in Scarborough Reserve, involvement in Cooks River Foreshores Working Party and preparation of a flora and fauna study in 2000. Policies towards the community include controlling noxious weeds on your property, planting native trees indigenous to the area and applying to the council prior to removing any trees. The Labor Tasmanian Government has created a new Environment Policy on biodiversity that hopes to preserve native plants and animals. The policies commit the government to encourage community involvement in biological diversity programs, proclaim the Tasman National Park, establish a State Biodiversity Committee with community representation to arrange a Tasmanian Biodiversity Strategy, support the development of a State Policy on the protection of remnant native vegetation, examine the possibility of incorporating the Biodiversity Strategy into legislation and seeking the co-operation of local government and the community in including and enforcing biological diversity guidelines in development criteria. The federal government has enabled several policies to deal with conservation of Australia's biodiversity. The government will support the National Reserve System program to expand Australia's National Parks, support off-reserve biodiversity conservation including the planting of trees and the protection of vegetation through the Bushcare program and work with the States to reduce unsustainable land clearing, develop an alert list of introduced plants and animals that pose a risk to our environment. The government will also maintain a ban on the export of live fauna; support research into Australia's floral and fauna assemblages as well as biodiversity conservation methods and ratify the Desertification Convention. An international conference held in Kyoto, Japan in December 1997 discussed issues on how best to reduce global warming. Kyoto Protocol negotiations have reached a legally binding agreement limiting the amount of gas emissions all industrialized countries. The protocol also included provisions for emission trading between industrialized countries. The overall nominal effect of the Kyoto protocol is for a reduction of 5.2% of emissions by 2010. However the agreement has many flaws and could lead to emission rising above 1990 levels. The protocol specifies that Japan must reduce emissions by 6%, USA by 7% and the European Union by 8%. The chairman of the conference negotiators, Raul Estrada said that further discussions were needed to find a way of implementing a system of trading in emissions. Trading allows countries that produce high levels of greenhouse gases, such as the USA,to buy the right to retain or even increase emissions. 15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)~~\\nGlobal warming refers to an expected rise in global average temperature due to the continued emission of greenhouse gases produced by industry and agriculture which trap heat in the atmosphere. Higher temperatures are expected to be accompanied by changing patterns of precipitation frequency and intensity, changes in soil moisture and a rise of the global sea level. To assess current examples relating to global warming, an examination is first needed on these examples. Sea levels could rise six feet and up in future centuries. The entire Amazon rainforest will be lost if the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases by more than 50%. But no matter whatever action the world takes to stop global warming, sea levels are set to rise and wipe out several island nations. The worst news is that whatever governments do to cut emissions, sea levels will rise by at least 2 metres over the next few hundred years, devastating Tuvalu and Kiribati in the Pacific and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean. Low-lying farmland and cities occupied by hundreds of millions of people will also be engulfed. Robert Nicholls of Middlesex University in London stated that thermal expansion of the ocean will continue for many hundreds of years after CO2 is stabilized, due to the gradual penetration of heat deeper and deeper into the ocean. All around the world ice sheets and glaciers are melting at a rate quite remarkably since record keeping began. A worldwide institute, based in Washington DC says that glaciers and other features are particularly sensitive to temperature shifts, and that scientists suspect the enhanced melting is among the first observable signs of human induced global warming. Some of the effects of global warming are as follows: arctic ocean sea ice shrunk by 6% since 1978, with a 14% loss of thicker year round ice, Greenland ice sheet has thinned by more than a metre a year on its southern and eastern edges since 1993 and 22% of glacial ice volume on the Tien Shan mountains has disappeared in the last 40 years. Worldwatch declared that the Earth's ice cover reflects much of the sun's heat back into space and the loss of much of it would affect the global, raise sea levels, and threaten water supplies. They also stated that the land and water left revealed by the retaining ice would themselves retain heat, creating a feedback loop that would speed up the warming process. The institute pronounced that the world's glaciers, taken as a whole, are now shrinking faster than they are growing. Worldwatch also warns of the outcomes of retaining ice on wildlife. In northern Canada reports of hunger and weight loss among polar bears have been associated with ice cover changes. And in Antarctica, sea loss, rising air temperatures and increased condensation are altering the habitats and the feeding and breeding patterns of seals and penguins. Cornell University ecologists believe that global warming may account for millions of human deaths from disease. David Pimentel a professor of ecology at Cornell stated and assumes that Most of the increase in disease is due to numerous environmental factors, including infectious microbes, pollution by chemicals and biological wastes and shortages of food and nutrients. Global warming will only make matters worse. Global warming will produce a favorable climate for disease producing organisms and plant pests. Global climate change will result in a net loss of obtainable food, for example the decline in rainfall (due to global warming) causes crop and plant production to die out. Infectious disease and environmental factors are to blame for more than 75% of all deaths in the world. Environmental disease may comprise of organic and chemical pollutants, including smoke from tabacco and wood sources. More than three billion people are malnourished. Malnutrition increases vulnerability to pollution-related illnesses and diseases such as diarrhea. Therefore Pimental concluded, we're seeing the first signs that global climate change can influence the incidences of human disease. And that this change combined with population growth and environmental degradation, will probably intensify world malnutrition and increases in other diseases as well. Melting is taking on vast and unprecedented level in the Arctic sea ice, the Antarctic and in dozens of mountain and sub-polar glaciers, and the rate has accelerated immensely in the past decade. The Earth's ice cover could have intense changes on the global climate and rising sea levels could start regional flooding. Melting of mountain glaciers could also endanger urban water supplies and the habitats of plant and animal species in fragile environments. Within the next 35 years, the Himalayan glacial area is expected to shrink by one-fifth, to just 100, 000 kilometres. A prediction forecasts that the remaining glaciers could disappear in 30 years. The melting has been especially noticeable in the past three decades, and scientists believe that it is the result of human behaviour and the build up of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. All current examples of global warming are significant due to the effects that it has on the environment and people. For people, it can cause infectious diseases and pollution-related illnesses that in turn effect our standard of living. Some examples can be more significant than others. For example diseases amongst people is more so important than the rise in sea levels and melting of glaciers since peoples existence are endangered\\n\\n		\\n		\\n		\\nIn Your Home – Conserve Energy \\n1.

Its effects and causes have been on the rise and people need to do something about it before the problem gets any worse. Global warming is an increase in the earth's temperature, which can be caused by the use of fossil fuels, and industrial or agricultural processes. Man-made emissions are adding to the amount of carbon dioxide already being naturally released. These harmful processes have been leading to a large increase in the buildup of "greenhouse gases," which are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. Up until the industrial revolution the world did not have such a terrifying problem of dealing with the buildup of harmful gases in the atmosphere but now with the increasing population growth, increased fossil fuel burning, and.....

Author: Eastine Charles Taneo\\n\\nDate published: March 10, 2012\\n\\n                       Deforestation has important implications for life on this planet. The transformation of forested lands by human actions represents one of the great forces in global environmental change and one of the great drivers of biodiversity loss. The impact of people has been and continues to be profound. Forests are cleared, degraded and fragmented by timber harvest, conversion to agriculture, road-building, fire, and in other ways. The effort to use and subdue the forest has been a constant theme in the transformation of the earth, in many societies, in many lands, and at most times. \\n\\n                       Forests are habitats and shelters to millions of species, reduce flooding, soil conserver, provide products for human use and consumption, give valuable ecosystem services.  They are home to more than half of all species living on land.  They also play several roles in the flooding because trees hold and use more water than farms or grasslands. With enough water, the river must rise above its banks and flood. The faster water runs from the watershed into the river, the higher a flood will be. Tree roots hold the soil in place, reducing the movement of sediment that can shrink river channels downstream and it can prevent soil erosion. Forests provide useful wood products.  Roundwood can be processed into building materials, or made into plywood products, furniture, etc. \\n\\n                       The following are factors of deforestation: logging, fires, urban construction, agriculture and commercial purposes.\\n\\n \\n\\n                     The first factor of deforestation is logging. Logging, both legal and illegal, is the cutting, skidding of trees in the forest. It is one of the major causes of deforestation in the world today. Trees that are cut-down are usually used by humans to trade. The logs are then generally transported to a saw mill to be cut into timber, a paper mill for paper pulp, of for other purposes like fence posts (Glastra, 1999). Logging is also tagged to the term “clearcutting”. It is a harvest method that removes essentially all the standing trees in a selected area (Glastra, 1999). A “clearcut” may or may not have reserve trees left to attain goals other than regeneration.\\n\\n                        There are different logging methods applied and some of these are “tree-length logging”, “full-tree logging”, and “cut-to-length logging”. Tree-length logging is a mechanized form of logging that involves felling and topping trees at the stump inside the cutblock or by the roadside (Wiki, 2009). The felled trees are then transported to the roadside or a landing site for hauling to a mill. Full-tree length is defined as trees are felled and transported to roadside with branches and top intact (Pulkki, no date). Transporting trees to the roadside is mainly by cable or grapple skidders. Cut-to-length method is trees are cut-off above the stump with stump height less than one-half butt diameter and bucked to various assortments directly in the stump area.\\n\\n                       The second factor of deforestation is fire. Forest fire is often used to signify an uncontrolled intense fire that breaks out in the wooded areas, grasslands, bushes, scrublands and peats due to many factors ranging from natural to man-made causes. It can easily spread to a vast area. It can also change its direction and overcome barriers like rivers and roads. Some of the causes of forest fires are natural such as lightning, and human activities and negligence like camp fire, lighted cigarettes (Bora, 2011) and kaingin system. Natural causes like lightning burns the trees and fire easily spread into the area.  About 14% of forest fires are due to lightning strikes (Dunn, 2009). Human activities and negligence are about 86% of forest fires (Dunn, 2009). Tourists or smokers sometimes leave camp fires or drop lighted items like cigarettes and matches in the forests which can easily set nearby bushes on fire and further develops into huge forest fire. On the other hand, kaingin or “slash-and-burn farming” system is an agricultural technique which involves intentional cutting and burning of trees in the forests to create fields. It includes a diverse collection of farming systems from long fallow shifting cultivation to short fallow shifting cultivation to forest pioneer farming. Unlike traditional farming methods that were used in harmony with the forests recuperative capacity, current slash-and-burn farming depletes the very soil resource upon which all agriculture and forestry depend. One of the strong commonalities of all slash-and-burn farmers is that they are among the poorest, most marginalized groups of their societies and have little or no influence on the important land use policy decisions made in their countries.\\n\\n                       The third cause of deforestation is urban construction. Forests are the way for residential houses, building and factories. Roads are building for trading and easier transports. This has made possible the needs of the social groups in the society. The cutting down of trees for lumber that is used for building materials, furniture, and paper products have a major impact on forest life. Forests are cleared to accommodate expanding urban areas.\\n\\n                       The fourth cause of deforestation is converting the forest to agricultural land. Trees in the forests are cut down to clear land for growing crops, build farms, ranches and other food growing lands. The economic consequences of deforestation and the process of becoming peasants are devastating. In contrast to the rich variety of foods the forest people are accustomed to plowing fields and peasants specialize in just four crops: rice, corn, tomatoes, and onions (Schelgel, 1999).  Hunting and fishing and gathering played almost no role at all in the cleared regions. The forests are gone and the rivers and creeks are seriously depleted. Commercial agriculture's role in deforestation is two-fold. First, agribusiness can indirectly result in deforestation. Commercial farms occupy the best and most fertile agricultural soils located in the valleys. This land is not available to the growing rural population that depends on agriculture for their subsistence. Without access to farmland in their immediate area, farming families have had to relocate to less fertile and less productive forested land. Second, agribusiness can be a direct cause of deforestation. Through a concession agreement, land purchase, or an informal land occupation; companies take possession of forested land with the intention of converting it to another use.\\n\\n                       The fifth cause is cattle ranching and livestock grazing. A cattle ranching is a major cause of deforestation. Ranchers occupy large tracts of forests and clear the land themselves or they buy the improvements made by small farmers. Traditionally, ranchers favored the more easily managed range and pasture lands of the dry forest zones, but for the last four decades there has been intensive clearing of the forests. Open-range grazing as is practiced in the dry woodlands can be a major contributor to deforestation when herd populations exceed the carrying capacity of the range. It can also seriously degrade the composition and quality of the forest when practiced too intensively.\\n                       The sixth cause of deforestation is mining and oil exploration that are locally important to deforestation. Large mines consumed vast quantities of indigenous woodlands to supply fuel to their smelting operations before plantations of fast-growing species were established (Lovekar, 2011). Oil exploration activities, such as the clearing of the seismic lines in the forests not only destroy the forests but also open them up to colonization by subsistence farmers who follow the exploration crews. The impact of gold mining has been widely publicized but its negative impacts have affected the indigenous peoples and the quality of the water more than the adjacent forests.\\n\\n                       The effects of deforestation may include loss of topsoil, disruption of the water cycle, loss of biodiversity, loss of potential discoveries, flooding and drought and climate change.\\n\\n                      First effect of deforestation is the loss of topsoil. Deforestation results in rapid degradation of nutrient rich topsoil. Heavy rainfall and high sunlight quickly damage the topsoil in clearings of forests. When these forests are cut-and-burnt, nutrients are released in the form of ash (Schlegel, 1999). This allows for a year or two of good crop on the newly cleared virgin land but eventually the nutrients will be washed away by the heavy tropical rain.\\n\\n                       Second effect of deforestation is the disruption of the water cycle. In the water cycle there are only a few processes that give water back to the atmosphere, such as transpiration, expiration and evaporation. Transpiration is the process by which water is loss from plants to the atmosphere (Starr, 2006). So, if plants are removed, especially at a high rate such as deforestation, there will be less water returning in the atmosphere. This will eventually cause a reduction in the amount of water returning the earth's surface such as the seas, lakes, rivers etc.\\n\\n                       Third effect is the loss of biodiversity. Biodiversity is the sum of all species occupying a specified area during a specified interval, past as well as present (Starr, 2006). Deforestation affects biological diversity by the destruction of natural habitats, which forces species out of their native areas. Isolation and fragmentation restrict their range, forcing them into unnatural and restrictive habitats, which may lead to their extinction. Temperature changes caused by loss of the protective canopy of the forest also contribute to this. Deforestation through clear-cutting creates a patched look to the landscape. Not only is this unpleasant to the eye, but it is terrible to the local wildlife. For other species, fragmented landscapes become population sinks that are sustained by immigration from nearby forest tracts (Schlegel, 1999). \\n\\n                       The fourth effect is the loss of potential discoveries. There is the possibility that the basic elements of potential medical treatments, cures and vaccines may lie undiscovered within these environments. The key active ingredient in one-fourth of the world’s prescription and non-prescription drugs come from plants growing in tropical rain forests. Fewer trees translate into an insecure future for forest workers. Some indigenous peoples’ way of life and survival are threatened by the loss of forests. Often, the stakeholders associated with forest areas are not always consulted before clearcutting occurs. This has sometimes lead to non-violent and violent confrontation and fueled bitter rivalries between area residents, the forest sector and environmentalists.\\n\\n                        The fifth effect is flooding and drought. One of the functions of forests is to absorb and store great amounts of water quickly when there are heavy rains. When the trees are cut down, it will not regulate or hold the flow of the water which leads to flooding and alters to drought. Deforestation causes a lack of soil cohesion and, because tree roots absorb water from the soil and allow it to absorb more water, it creates an ideal environment for flooding. A flat, treeless surface is perfect for flash floods. Flash flood has been the deadliest disaster that struck and killed hundreds of people in the cities of Cagyan de Oro and Iligan (Villanueva, 2011) last December  2011.\\n\\n                       The sixth effect of deforestation is global warming. Global warming is a phenomenon (greenhouse effect) whereby solar radiation that has reflected back off the surface of the earth remains trapped at atmospheric levels, due to the build-up of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, rather than being emitted back into space (Starr, 2006).\\n\\nThe major greenhouse gases and their sources/causes are:\\n\\nCarbon dioxide (CO2)\\n	-Fossil fuel, deforestation, animal respiration.\\n\\nMethane (CH4)\\n	-Cattle, rice paddies, gas leaks, termites, mining\\n\\nNitrous oxide (N2O)\\n	-Burning of fossil fuels, deforestation.\\n\\nChlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)\\n	-Air conditioning, solvents                             \\n\\nOzone (O3) and other trace gases\\n	-Car exhaust, power plants, photochemicals. \\n\\n\\n                       Global temperature is also rising. Different studies have shown the world’s average temperature has risen by 0.5o F-1.0o F on an average (Lovekar, 2011). The rise in the mean surface air temperature over the past hundred years supports this long term estimate. It is unknown whether the rise is part of Earth’s natural climate cycle or a result of the increase in greenhouse gases from human activity. A study in Canada, analyzing ground surface temperature, has found a one to two degree increase in ground surface temperature at the time of deforestation at each site (Swemson, 2011).\\n\\n                        The possible ways to protect and preserve the forests may include the following: reforestation, educating the farmers about deforestation, strict implementation of law about the problem, sustainable forest and water management.\\n\\n                       The first way is reforestation. It is causing a forest to occur again. This can be done by letting deforested land go fallow for several years or by replanting native species in open areas or adjacent to remaining forest. Here in Mindanao, some government and non-government organizations are doing tree planting projects. They plant trees to lessen the effect of climate change and recover what has been damaged by logging in the forest. The Philippine government supplies the seedlings but according to Pres. Benigno Aquino III there is an inadequate supply of seedlings that we could use in the country (Porcalla, 2011).\\n\\n                       The second way is educating the farmers.  There are peasant farmers who have left their traditional farm lands in search of new opportunities on the forest frontier. With a growing local population, restricted access to arable land, and few economic alternatives they have been forced to migrate to forested state lands to establish a new farm and homestead. They become prisoners of illiteracy and endemic poverty, and driven by the lack of access to arable lands and the lack of alternative employment opportunities, subsistence farming families must survive by clearing the forests to plant their crops. Though education, they can be responsible farmers. They must know the importance of our forests. The government may also give them alternative source of income like sustainable livelihood projects instead of clearing the forest to be converted in agricultural lands.\\n\\n                       The third way is the strict implementation of the laws concerning about deforestation. The authorities must strictly impose penalties to the one who breaks the law. Here in our country, Philippines, these are examples of the law of our government to fight deforestation: DENR Memorandum No. 52 and Executive Order No. 23.\\n\\n                      DENR(Department of Environment and Natural Resources) Memorandum No. 52 is limiting the processing of application permits of forest tenure holders within their plantation sites only (Villanueva, 2011). Environment and Natural Resources Ramon Paje announced last year, 2011, that chainsaws, bulldozers graders, and other logging tools and implements are now off-limits in natural and residual forests nationwide.\\n\\n                       Executive Order No. 23 is declaring a logging ban. President Benigno Aquino III issued the ban after visiting the provinces hit by floods and landslides in the country.\\n\\n                       The fourth way is sustainable forest and water management. According to Dr. Victor Rex Cruz, dean of the UP College of Forestry and Natural Resources, a sustainable forest management program to put in a place to assure sustainable harvest from natural forest, more investments in plantations and tree industries, and protection of watershed and protected areas while assuring the continuity of forest products and environmental services from all types of forests (Porcalla, 2011).\\n\\n                        Therefore, deforestation has a great impact in our society. It threatens not only biodiversity but it also endangers us humans which should protect the forest. It is true that it gives economic improvement to us but it also gives bad environmental effects. Controlling the problem is not a simple matter of enacting new laws and enforcing new regulations because laws and regulations already exist. What we need to do is to follow and obey this laws and regulations to lessen the bad effects of deforestation. We should be part of the solution and not adding to the problem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n•	Bora, C.

Individual differences psychology focuses on this second level of study. It is also sometimes called Differential Psychology because researchers in this area study the ways in which individual people differ in their behavior. This is distinguished from other aspects of psychology in that although psychology is ostensibly a study of individuals, modern psychologists often study groups or biological underpinnings of cognition.\\n\\nFor example, in evaluating the effectiveness of a new therapy, the mean performance of the therapy in one group might be compared to the mean effectiveness of a placebo (or a well-known therapy) in a second, control group. In this context, differences between individuals in their reaction to the experimental and control manipulations are actually treated as errors rather than as interesting phenomena to study.\\n\\nThis is because psychological research depends upon statistical controls that are only defined upon groups of people. Individual difference psychologists usually express their interest in individuals while studying groups by seeking dimensions shared by all individuals but upon which individuals differ.
'''Introduction:'''\\n\\nFlood is a common phenomenon in Bangladesh. Flood related crises have a gender dimension and affect women, the silent gender, more than men, who have the least capacity to deal with the situation for a variety of cultural, economical, historical, political and social reasons. Floods hit women harder, not just because they are physically weaker, but because of their reproductive capacity, physical responsibility for children and vulnerable socio-economic status. The patriarchal social structure and norms, gendered economics and gendered culture of Bangladesh, underpinned by religious traditions restrict the mobility of women during floods. Wider household responsibilities of women like food processing and cooking, cleaning, collecting water and fuel, bearing and rearing children looking after livestock and income generation also become much more difficult to perform under flood conditions. This article is attempted to highlight how women become more vulnerable by their social status, both during and after the full impact of floods and also the strategies adopted by flood victim women, which are crucial for the household survival.\\n\\n\\n'''Flood and its causes:'''\\n\\nThe origins of floods in Bangladesh are diverse. Floodwater may come from three main sources:\\n\\n	Rivers\\n	Rainfall\\n	Sea\\n\\nThree together or independently, may all generate more water that can’t be drained quickly from the land. However, the specific causes of floods vary from region to region. Several explanations have been addressed here:\\n\\n	Confluence of the major rivers\\n	High monsoon rainfall\\n	Rise of sea level\\n	Siltation of rivers\\n	Flood control measures\\n	Deforestation\\n	Construction of Farakka barrage and others\\n\\nThe last three causes, flood control measures, deforestation and the construction of Farakka barrage, are not only due to natural environmental factors but also to social factors.\\n\\n'''Flood control measures and women:'''\\n\\nIn Bangladesh embankments have been used as a traditional flood control measure since long time. However, a number of studies and reports have pointed out the negative consequences of Flood Control and Drainage (FCD) and Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation (FCDI) projects: the benefits of these projects were not planned. Because such projects are often not based on the nature of the flood plain, they do not prevent flood but rather increase flood losses. Many embankments have had a negative effect on river regimes, land formation, agriculture and fisheries and on the overall environment. Researchers have pointed out that any step to control flooding should emphasize both the structural and non-structural methods. They have discussed the problems of floods and the negative consequences upon the environment, farmers (men), and fisheries and on many other aspects of life in Bangladesh. However, they have ignored the problems of women. There has been almost no discussion of the differential impact of flooding upon men and women and very little about its impact upon people in different socio-economic categories. Policy makers, however, have only recently started to think about the way in which women might be involved in different activities from men and have different experiences of flooding from men, They have agreed that women’s activities should be ‘visible’ in the development sector and therefore, should be integrated with development activities in the water sector (The Fourth Five Year Plan, 1995). There are only a few studies (e. g. Adnan, 1990; Hanchett, 1992) which briefly consider the situation of women during floods. FAP 14’s gender study was based on a few case studies of female-headed households and was not compared with men’s response.\\n\\n'''Problems faced by women during floods:'''\\n\\nDuring floods women face different types of problems. For example:\\n\\n	Women suffer from lack of food, clothing and shelter during floods. Owing to their lack of resources, poor women face greater problems than women in middle and rich households. They suffer from shortages of food and other essentials, resulting in increasing prices and a consequent decline in purchasing power. They often have to eat unusual food and adjust consumption patterns of this.\\n\\n	Unemployed men often sit idle or move elsewhere leaving their household members behind during floods. It is women, the household-based workers, who have to take responsibility for protecting their houses, children and other members of the family, livestock and belongings.\\n\\n	Traditional gender specific work, such as carrying water, cooking, caring for children and animals become too difficult for women during flood conditions. Especially gender-assigned tasks like procuring food and providing drinking water, storing fuel and child care are such that women have to bear more physical burden of coping than men do. \\n\\n	Women’s assets such milch cows, poultry, trees, kitchen and utensils are particularly vulnerable to flood.\\n\\n	Domestic violence also increases during floods. Husbands beat their wives and children when food-supply run out in flood-stricken households.\\n\\n	Many women often become unwilling to go to flood shelters because of the Muslim culture ‘purdah’ which means that women should not show themselves to unrelated men.\\n\\n	During floods poor widow women confine to their houses for many days and have to drink flood water as they have neither the physical strength to reach tube wells, nor the economic means to hire a boat to collect clean water.\\n\\n	Bangladeshi women wear long 'Shari', which hinders their movement from one place to another during floods. It often entangles in fixed debris and limits the speed of evacuation. Again, poor women with only one Shari are often oblige to remain in wet cloth for most of the days for the lack of private space and to dry off.\\n\\n	Victim women often don’t have cloths to come out to take relief. Again, many women lose their breast-feeding infants in flood and suffer from puffed breast pain. There also happen cases of miscarriage which don’t get proper medication during floods. Pregnant and lactating women suffer from malnutrition i.e. lack of vitamin A, iodine and iron deficiencies, which result in eye diseases, night blindness, anemia, goiter etc.\\n\\n	In flood shelters women face several problems, which are related to their gender identity. For example, it becomes impossible for women to disregard their inhibition and go to latrines, which are open to all. They often have to wait till dark/night to ensure privacy to response the calls by nature, even changing the clothes/sanitary pad with menstrual blood.\\n\\n	While distributing relief in shelters, women are often pushed down and left behind in the rush by men. Again, child care, illness and conservatism keep many women away from taking relief goods. Women also give part of their food ration to their children consequently denying themselves the opportunity to maintain their strength and support their families.\\n\\n	Women who are in their own for whatever reason, whether they are single, widowed, abandoned, unaccompanied, lone heads of households or who have been separated from male family members by the chaos of the flood situations, often become victim of sexual violence in flood shelters.\\n\\n	Women are further vulnerable to the secondary impacts of floods due to socio-cultural and economic factors. When resources such as temporary shelter, fresh water, food and medicines are distributed, women are again marginalized. For example, in many cases women are unable to make decisions about whether loans should be secured to rebuild homes or to purchase crop seeds or other means to generate an income such as the purchase of a boat for transporting goods.        \\n\\n'''Coping mechanisms of women during floods:'''\\n\\nFloods affect both women and men but the burden of coping with flood falls heavily on women. The tasks women perform before, during and after floods, the problems they face and the coping mechanisms they adopt are related to women’s gender identity. Women in poorer categories often act as men do in making platforms, cutting bamboo, making bamboo bridges protecting crops and livestock and engaging in income generating activities. On the other hand, men usually remain more restricted to their gender-assigned activities. Some of the coping mechanisms of women have been highlighted here.\\n'''\\nWomen and water collection:'''\\n\\nThe collection of water during floods causes great problems for women. Women are usually responsible for collecting and storing water. During floods tube-wells, the most common source of pure drinking water in Bangladesh, go under water and poor women have to take considerable risks to procure drinking water from great distances. They have to walk through chest-high water or swim to collect fresh or clean water. Again, they have not enough fuel to boil water or fitciri to purify it with alum. However, they help each other to get pure drinking water from different sources.\\n\\n'''Sale of women’s assets:'''\\n\\nThe sale of assets is a common way for rural households to survive any crisis. Non-productive assets like milking cows or goats, jewellery or household items cannot usually produce a continuous income as land or cattle but they can easily be converted to cash and are therefore the first to be disposed off to meet the immediate needs of family survival. These assets usually belong to women, and they are often their only assets. They are sold, or mortgaged by their husbands to repay loans, to educate sons or to maintain the livelihood of the households. Both women and men resist changing their status from farmer to landless as long as they have other options to cope with crisis. Most women don’t have own valuable assets as men do. Even if they have some assets they are considered ‘less valuable’ or ‘non-productive’. However, women’s ‘non-productive’ assets become more ‘productive’ when they are disposed off during floods. Women’s assets are used to meet the immediate needs of the households during floods when men’s assets are kept for the future. \\n\\n'''Women and food preparation:'''\\n\\nDuring floods there is a great difference in the kind of food, the amount and the frequency of food preparation and the sources of food among women in different socio-economic categories. The food supplies of the poor, undernourished and malnourished at the best of times, are further reduced during the floods and it is women who have the responsibility for adjusting the household food consumption. Women’s work is closely related with agricultural production, family food and income generation and that is why the burden of food shortage falls upon them.\\n\\nMost of the poor households don’t have a reliable and stable source of food during floods. Women in these categories play a vital role in acquiring food from many sources, some of which are totally different from flood-free sources. When there is a shortage they try to manage food through their own efforts by gathering edible or wild plants and small amounts of low quality food such as rotten or discarded vegetables or accepting rice gruel from better-off women. Destitute and landless women maintain their livelihood by a hand-to-mouth existence. During floods the normal pattern of food consumption in the household changes. The price of staple food items becomes so high that it goes beyond the purchasing power of the poor. So, they often cook khesari or kalai dal (kind of inferior pulse), mania or cheer paddy, which they consider to be animal food, curry with fen (rice gruel) and chhatu (flour normally made of barley or chickpea or maize), kura (the red powdery coating of rice under the husk), lumps of flour burnt in the fire, one handful of rice with lots of water and chili, fried broken bits of grain and different aquatic plants. It is also evident that both women and men in poorer categories suffer from food shortages and women commonly sacrifice their own meals for their husbands and children.\\n\\n''' \\nWomen and common village resources:'''\\nDuring floods women become undernourished subsisting on a lean diet of vegetables, creepers and herbs. Their dependence on food from the common land increases greatly. When men fail to earn any money, they become helpless and do not feel it incumbent upon them to find alternative source of food for their families. Women, on the other hand, are much more capable than men of collecting food for families. They usually collect variety of food items from village common land like Shapla (the stem of the water lily) which women use as a major food item and is often mixed with others like kolmi shak (arum leaves) or kochumukhi (wild arum). \\n\\n'''Women and family health care:'''\\n\\nThere are some general flood-diseases, such as, diarrhea, viral fever, jaundice, skin diseases, conjunctivitis and swelling of limbs. It is evident that without any healthcare facilities from government or other organizations during floods, it is women who provide health care for the sick. Only women have knowledge about certain medicinal trees and they use herbs, roots and barks to cure family members from different types of diseases. Poorer women take risks to collect medicinal herbs from distant places during the floods despite purda restrictions. Men, on the other hand, rarely do such work because providing herbal treatment or nursing is not their gender-assigned role. Men in poorer categories also do not have the resources to get modern treatment. However, most women in the poorer categories, despite their own sickness and other activities, try their best to cure sick family members themselves in order to avoid the cost of modern treatment.\\n\\n'''Women and social network:'''\\n\\nWith little or no support from the government during floods, the women of poor households sick help from their social networks. Such support mainly comes from their own and that of their husbands’ kin and sometimes from patrons and neighbors. Women are able to get more support from such relationships than men. Relatives and neighbors provide shelter, lend food, supply loans with little or no interest, provide temporary employment and help with money, labor or materials to rebuild houses after floods. Men, on the other hand, do not show such ability to provide for their households. Borrowing small things or food is not a man’s responsibility and asking for help is often considered below their dignity.\\n\\n'''Recommendations:'''\\n\\nDuring floods where people as a whole are vulnerable, women are more vulnerable as they bear the burden of managing the survival of the household. Therefore, special attention should be given on after-flood rehabilitation program for women. For example:\\n\\n	There should be more female volunteers. In the case of major floods, male volunteers can not adequately meet women’s needs. \\n\\n	Women relief workers face higher security risks and obstructive ness from local male leaders and government officials when trying to carry out their work. More women volunteers should be available to form a strong group, able to overcome these problems collectively.\\n\\n	Female doctors and nurses should be included in the volunteer team, alongside a male medical team. Emergency medicine and equipment should be available to cope with women’s needs. For example, many women lost their breast-feeding infants during floods. Pumps to express breast milk must be available, in order to avoid serious infection and debilitating pain. Equipment and medication is needed to handle the inevitable miscarriages. \\n\\n	Poor women generally know fewer languages. So, local volunteers are needed to overcome language problems, in order to get access to the women more easily and to understand their specific needs.\\n\\n	During relief distribution women should be given first priority, and a separate distribution line needs to be organized for them as they have the additional responsibility for children.\\n\\n	In particularly conservative areas women may need house-to-house distribution as they face social obstacles to come to the distribution line to compete in the struggle for food supplies, elbowing and pushing, with men.\\n\\n\\n	As women must be fully clothed to go out to get food, clothing is an essential part of emergency relief.\\n     \\n'''Conclusion:'''\\n\\nThe inclusion of gender perspective in the study of flood is very pertinent and justified considering the context of Bangladesh. During floods where people as a whole are vulnerable, women become more vulnerable who bear the burden of managing the survival of household under crisis. Therefore, for effective flood management programs to be conceived and implemented successfully, gender specific awareness must be fully realized and accounted for. Since many women become disoriented and threatened by the loss of their homes, flood management policies need to be sensitive and aware of the meaning and significance of home and the implications for dealing with female flood victims. To reduce the vulnerability of women during floods specific programs should be devised and implemented that raise the awareness of women to the risks they face and also the range of adjustments that they can make. Such programs also need to be culturally and socially sensitive. Because of women’s significant contributions to their households’ survival during floods, their activities need to receive attention in government planning. \\n\\n \\n'''Bibliography:''' \\n\\nAhsan, Rosie Majid and Khatun.

Environmental issues in India are many. Air pollution, water pollution, garbage pollution and wildlife natural habitat pollution challenge India. The situation was worse between 1947 through 1995. According to data collection and environment assessment studies of World Bank experts, between 1995 through 2010, India has made one of the fastest progress in the world, in addressing its environmental issues and improving its environmental quality.[1][2] Still, India has a long way to go to reach environmental quality similar to those enjoyed in developed economies. Pollution remains a major challenge and opportunity for India.\\n\\nSome believe economic development is leading to environmental issues in India. Others believe economic development is key to improving India's environmental management and preventing pollution in India.\\n\\nSome suggest India's growing population is the primary cause of India's environmental degradation. Systematic studies challenge this theory. Empirical evidence from countries such as Japan, England and Singapore, each with population density similar or higher than India, yet each enjoying environmental quality vastly superior than India, suggests population density may not be the only factor affecting India's issues.[3]\\n\\nMajor environmental issues are forest and agricultural degradation of land, resource depletion (water, mineral, forest, sand, rocks etc.), environmental degradation, public health, loss of biodiversity, loss of resilience in ecosystems, livelihood security for the poor.[4]\\n\\nThe major sources of pollution in India include the rampant burning of fuelwood and biomass such as dried waste from livestock as the primary source of energy,[5] lack of organized garbage and waste removal services, lack of sewage treatment operations, lack of flood control and monsoon water drainage system, diversion of consumer waste into rivers, cremation practices near major rivers, government mandated protection of highly polluting old public transport, and continued operation by Indian government of government owned, high emission plants built between 1950 to 1980.[6][7][8][9][10]\\n\\nIndia's water supply and sanitation issues are related to many environmental issues.\\n\\nEnvironmental issues are one of the primary causes of disease, health issues and long term livelihood impact for India.\\nContents\\n [hide] \\n\\n    * 1 History\\n    * 2 Major issues\\n          o 2.1 Population growth and environmental quality\\n    * 3 Pollution\\n          o 3.1 Water pollution\\n          o 3.2 Recent efforts to address water issues\\n          o 3.3 Air pollution\\n          o 3.4 Solid waste pollution\\n          o 3.5 Noise pollution\\n          o 3.6 Land pollution\\n    * 4 Environmental issues and Indian law\\n    * 5 Conservation\\n    * 6 See also\\n    * 7 References\\n    * 8 Further reading\\n    * 9 External links\\n\\n[edit] History\\nAshoka Pillar Edicts were one of earliest efforts in India focussed on respecting and preserving environment, forests and wildlife.\\n\\nYajnavalkya Smriti, a historic Indian text on statecraft and jurisprudence, suggested to have been written before 5th century AD, prohibited the cutting of trees and prescribed punishment for such acts. Kautalya's Arthashastra, written in India's Mauryan period, emphasized the need for forest administration. Ashoka went further, and his Pillar Edicts expressed his view about the welfare of environment and biodiversity.\\n\\n    "Happiness in this world and the next is difficult to obtain without much love for the dhamma, much self-examination, much respect, much fear of evil, and much enthusiasm. [...] Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi (Ashoka), speaks thus: Animals were declared to be protected – parrots, mainas, aruna, geese, wild ducks, nandimukhas, gelatas, bats, queen ants, terrapins, boneless fish, vedareyaka, gangapuputaka, sankiya fish, tortoises, porcupines, squirrels, deer, bulls, okapinda, wild asses, wild pigeons, domestic pigeons and all four-footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible. Also protected were nanny goats, ewes and sows which are with young or giving milk to their young, and so are young ones less than six months old. Cocks are not to be caponized, husks hiding living beings are not to be burnt, and forests are not to be burnt either without reason or to kill creatures. One animal is not to be fed to another. Our king killed very few animals."\\n\\n    — Ashoka's Seven Pillar Edicts[11]\\n\\nBritish rule of India saw several laws related to environment. Amongst the earliest ones were Shore Nuisance (Bombay and Kolaba) Act of 1853 and the Oriental Gas Company Act of 1857. The Indian Penal Code of 1860, imposed a fine on anyone who voluntarily fouls the water of any public spring or reservoir. In addition, the Code penalised negligent acts. British India also enacted laws aimed at controlling air pollution. Prominent amongst these were the Bengal Smoke Nuisance Act of 1905 and the Bombay Smoke Nuisance Act of 1912. While these laws failed in having the intended effect, British-enacted legislations pioneered the growth of environmental regulations in India.\\n\\nUpon independence from Britain, India adopted a constitution and numerous British-enacted laws, without any specific constitutional provision on protecting environment. India amended its constitution in 1976. Article 48(A) of Part IV of the amended constitution, read: The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country. Article 51 A(g) imposed additional environmental mandates on the Indian state.\\n\\nOther Indian laws from recent history include the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1974, the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981. The Air Act was inspired by the decisions made at Stockholm Conference. The Bhopal gas tragedy triggered the Government of India to enact the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986. India has also enacted a set of Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules in 2000.\\n\\nIn 1985, Indian government created the Ministry of Environment and Forests. This ministry is the central administrative organisation in India for regulating and ensuring environmental protection.\\n\\nDespite active passage of laws by the central government of India, the reality of environmental quality mostly worsened between 1947 to 1990. Most of Indian economy was nationalized and owned by India, and regulations were mostly ignored by state run enterprises. Rural poor had no choice, but to sustain life in whatever way possible. The state governments of India often regarded environmental laws enacted by the central government as a mere paperwork formality. Air emissions increased, water pollution worsened, forest cover decreased.\\n\\nStarting in 1990s, reforms were introduced. Since then, for the first time in Indian history, major air pollutant concentrations have dropped in every 5 year period. Between 1992 to 2010, satellite data confirms India's forest coverage has increased for the first time by over 4 million hectares, a 7% increase.[12]\\n[edit] Major issues\\nFloods are a significant environmental issue for India. It causes soil erosion, destruction of wetlands and wide migration of solid wastes.\\n\\nAir pollution, poor management of waste, growing water scarcity, falling groundwater tables, water pollution, preservation and quality of forests, biodiversity loss, and land/soil degradation are some of the major environmental issues India faces today.[13]\\n\\nIndia's population growth adds pressure to environmental issues and its resources.\\n\\nEnvironmental issues in India include various natural hazards, particularly cyclones and annual monsoon floods. An estimated 60% of cultivated land suffers from soil erosion, waterlogging, and salinity. It is also estimated that between 4.7 and 12 billion tons of topsoil are lost annually from soil erosion.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe Indian Agricultural Research Institute of Parvati has estimated that a 3 °C rise in temperature will result in a 15 to 20% loss in annual wheat yields.[citation needed] These are substantial problems for a nation with such a large population depending on the productivity of primary resources and whose economic growth relies heavily on industrial growth. Civil conflicts involving natural resources—most notably forests and arable land—have occurred in eastern and northeastern states.\\n[edit] Population growth and environmental quality\\n\\nThere is a long history of study and debate about the interactions between population growth and the environment. According to the British thinker Malthus, for example, a growing population exerts pressure on agricultural land, causing environmental degradation, and forcing the cultivation of land of poorer and poorer quality. This environmental degradation ultimately reduces agricultural yields and food availability, causes famines and diseases and death, thereby reducing the rate of population growth. Population growth, because it can place increased pressure on the assimilative capacity of the environment, is also seen as a major cause of air, water, and solid-waste pollution. The result, Malthus theorized, is an equilibrium population that enjoys low levels of both income and environmental quality. Malthus suggested positive and preventative forced control of human population, along with abolition of poor laws.\\n\\nMalthus theory, published between 1798 and 1826, has been analyzed and criticized ever since. The American thinker Henry George, for example, observed with his characteristic piquancy in dismissing Malthus: "Both the jayhawk and the man eat chickens; but the more jayhawks, the fewer chickens, while the more men, the more chickens." Similarly, the American economist Julian Lincoln Simon criticised Malthus's theory.[14] He noted that the facts of human history have proven the predictions of Malthus and of the Neo-Malthusians to be flawed. Massive geometric population growth in the 20th century did not result in a Malthusian catastrophe. The possible reasons include: increase in human knowledge, rapid increases in productivity, innovation and application of knowledge, general improvements in farming methods (industrial agriculture), mechanization of work (tractors), the introduction of high-yield varieties of wheat and other plants (Green Revolution), the use of pesticides to control crop pests.[15]\\n\\nMore recent scholarly articles concede that while there is no question that population growth may contribute to environmental degradation, its effects can be modified by economic growth and modern technology.[16] Research in environmental economics has uncovered a relationship between environmental quality, measured by ambient concentrations of air pollutants and per capita income. This so-called environmental Kuznets curve shows environmental quality worsening up until about $5,000 of per capita income on purchasing parity basis, and improving thereafter.[17] The key requirement, for this to be true, is continued adoption of technology and scientific management of resources, continued increases in productivity in every economic sector, entrepreneurial innovation and economic expansion.\\n\\nOther data suggests that population density has little correlation to environmental quality and human quality of life. India's population density, in 2011, was about 368 human beings per square kilometer. Many countries with population density similar or higher than India enjoy environmental quality as well as human quality of life far superior than India. For example: Singapore (7148 /km2), Hong Kong-China (6349 /km2), South Korea (487 /km2), Netherlands (403 /km2), Belgium (355 / km2), Japan (337/ km2), England (395 /km2), the state of Florida (353 / km2), the state of New York (412 / km2), the state of Massachusetts (840 / km2), the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (523 / km2), the region of Île-de-France (974 / km2), and the region of Lombardy (417 / km2).\\n[edit] Pollution\\n[edit] Water pollution\\nSee also: Water supply and sanitation in India\\nHanskhali drainage canal, it passes contaminated water direct to the Ganges at Howrah, West Bengal. Sewage and drainage canals like this are the dominant cause of water pollution in India.\\n\\nA 2007 study finds that discharge of untreated sewage is single most important cause for pollution of surface and ground water in India. There is a large gap between generation and treatment of domestic wastewater in India. The problem is not only that India lacks sufficient treatment capacity but also that the sewage treatment plants that exist do not operate and are not maintained. Majority of the government-owned sewage treatment plants remain closed most of the time due to improper design or poor maintenance or lack of reliable electricity supply to operate the plants, together with absentee employees and poor management. The wastewater generated in these areas normally percolates in the soil or evaporates. The uncollected wastes accumulate in the urban areas cause unhygienic conditions and release pollutants that leaches to surface and groundwater.[18]\\n\\nA 1992 World Health Organization study is claimed to have reported that out of India's 3,119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial sewage treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities.[19] Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. A 1995 report claimed 114 Indian cities were dumping untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River.[20] Open defecation is widespread even in urban areas of India.[21][22] This situation is typical of India as well as other developing countries.\\n\\nAccording to another 2005 report, sewage discharged from cities and towns is the predominant cause of water pollution in India. Investment is needed to bridge the gap between 29000 million litre per day of sewage India generates, and a treatment capacity of mere 6000 million litre per day.[23] A large number of Indian rivers are severely polluted as a result of discharge of domestic sewage.\\n\\nThe Central Pollution Control Board, a Ministry of Environment & Forests Government of India entity, has established a National Water Quality Monitoring Network comprising 1429 monitoring stations in 27 states and 6 in Union Territories on various rivers and water bodies across the country. This effort monitors water quality year round. The monitoring network covers 293 rivers, 94 lakes, 9 tanks, 41 ponds, 8 creeks, 23 canals, 18 drains and 411 wells distributed across India.[24] Water samples are routinely analyzed for 28 parameters including dissolved oxygen, bacteriological and other internationally established parameters for water quality. Additionally 9 trace metals parameters and 28 pesticide residues are analyzed. Biomonitoring is also carried out on specific locations.\\n\\nThe scientific analysis of water samples from 1995 to 2008 indicates that the organic and bacterial contamination are severe in water bodies of India. This is mainly due to discharge of domestic wastewater in untreated form, mostly from the urban centers of India.\\n\\nIn 2008, the water quality monitoring found almost all rivers with high levels of BOD. The worst pollution, in decreasing order, were found in river Markanda (590 mg O/l), followed by river Kali (364), river Amlakhadi (353), Yamuna canal (247), river Yamuna at Delhi (70) and river Betwa (58). For context, a water sample with a 5 day BOD between 1 and 2 mg O/L indicates a very clean water, 3 to 8 mg O/L indicates a moderately clean water, 8 to 20 indicates borderline water, and greater than 20 mg O/L indicates ecologically-unsafe polluted water.\\n\\nThe Mithi River, which flows through the city of Mumbai, is heavily polluted.\\n\\nThe levels of BOD are severe near the cities and major towns. In rural parts of India, the river BOD levels were sufficient to support aquatic life.\\n\\nTotal coliform and fecal coliform densities in the rivers of India range between 500 to 100,000 MPN/100 ml.[24] The presence of coliform suggests that the water is being contaminated with the fecal material of humans, livestocks, pets and other animals. Rivers Yamuna, Ganga, Gomti, Ghaggar, Chambal, Mahi, Vardha are amongst the other most coliform polluted water bodies in India. For context, coliform must be below 104 MPN/100 ml,[25] preferably absent from water for it to be considered safe for general human use, and for irrigation where coliform may cause disease outbreak from contaminated-water in agriculture.[26][27]\\n\\nIn 2006, 47 percent of water quality monitoring stations in India reported a total average annual coliform levels above 500 MPN/100 ml. During 2008, 33 percent of all water quality monitoring stations reported a total coliform levels exceeding those levels, suggesting recent effort to add pollution control infrastructure and upgrade treatment plants in India, may be reversing the water pollution trend.\\n\\nTreatment of domestic sewage and subsequent utilization of treated sewage for irrigation can prevent pollution of water bodies, reduce the demand for fresh water in irrigation sector and become a resource for irrigation. Since 2005, Indian wastewater treatment plant market has been growing annually at the rate of 10 to 12 percent. The United States is the largest supplier of treatment equipment and supplies to India, with 40 percent market share of new installation.[28] At this rate of expansion, and assuming the government of India continues on its path of reform, major investments in sewage treatment plants and electricity infrastructure development, India will nearly triple its water treatment capacity by 2015, and treatment capacity supply will match India's daily sewage water treatment requirements by about 2020.\\n\\nWater resources have not been linked to either domestic or international violent conflict as was previously anticipated by some observers. Possible exceptions, notes a 2004 report, include some communal violence related to distribution of water from the Kaveri River and political tensions surrounding actual and potential population displacements by dam projects, particularly on the Narmada River.[29] A 1997 article claimed Punjab is another hotbed of pollution, for example, Buddha Nullah, a rivulet which run through Malwa region of Punjab, India, and after passing through highly populated Ludhiana district, before draining into Sutlej River, a tributary of the Indus river, is today an important case point in the recent studies, which suggest this as another Bhopal in making.[30]\\n\\nA joint study by PGIMER and Punjab Pollution Control Board in 2008, revealed that in villages along the Nullah, calcium, magnesium, fluoride, mercury, beta-endosulphan and heptachlor pesticide were more than permissible limit (MPL) in ground and tap waters. Plus the water had high concentration of COD and BOD (chemical and biochemical oxygen demand), ammonia, phosphate, chloride, chromium, arsenic and chlorpyrifos pesticide. The ground water also contains nickel and selenium, while the tap water has high concentration of lead, nickel and cadmium.[31] The Hindon River, which flows through the city of Ghaziabad, highly polluted and groundwater of this city has colored and poisoned by industrial effluents, Hindon Vahini is strongly opposing of water pollution activities.\\n\\nFlooding during monsoons worsens India's water pollution problem, as it washes and moves all sorts of solid garbage and contaminated soils into its rivers and wetlands.\\n\\nThe annual average precipitation in India is about 4000 billion cubic metres.[23] From this, with the state of Indian infrastructure in 2005, the available water resource through the rivers is about 1869 billion cubic meters. Accounting to uneven distribution of rain over the country each year, water resources available for utilization, including ground water, is claimed to be about 1122 billion cubic meters. Much of this water is unsafe, because pollution degrades water quality. Water pollution severely limits the amount of water available to Indian consumer, its industry and its agriculture.\\n\\nThe Ganges\\n\\nMillions depend on the polluted Ganges river.\\nMain article: Pollution of the Ganges\\n\\n    To know why 1,000 Indian children die of diarrhoeal sickness every day, take a wary stroll along the Ganges in Varanasi. As it enters the city, Hinduism’s sacred river contains 60,000 faecal coliform bacteria per 100 millilitres, 120 times more than is considered safe for bathing. Four miles downstream, with inputs from 24 gushing sewers and 60,000 pilgrim-bathers, the concentration is 3,000 times over the safety limit. In places, the Ganges becomes black and septic. Corpses, of semi-cremated adults or enshrouded babies, drift slowly by.\\n\\n    — The Economist on December 11, 2008[32]\\n\\nMore than 400 million people live along the Ganges River. An estimated 2,000,000 persons ritually bathe daily[citation needed] in the river, which is considered holy by Hindus. In the Hindu religion it is said to flow from the lotus feet of Vishnu (for Vaisnava devotees) or the hair of Shiva (for Saivites). The spiritual and religious significance could be compared to what the Nile river meant to the ancient Egyptians. While the Ganges may be considered holy, there are some problems associated with the ecology. It is filled with chemical wastes[citation needed], sewage and even the remains of human and animal corpses which carry major health risks by either direct bathing in the water, or by drinking (the Fecal-oral route).\\n\\nThe Yamuna\\n\\nThe Taj Mahal next to the polluted Yamuna river.\\nMain article: Yamuna\\n\\nNewsWeek describes Delhi's sacred Yamuna River as "a putrid ribbon of black sludge" where fecal bacteria is 10,000 over safety limits despite a 15-year program to address the problem.[33] Cholera epidemics are not unknown.[33] NewsWeek observes India's messy democracy is particularly ill equipped to handle the conflicting pressures of rapid growth and poverty. Even though India revised its national water policy in 2002 to encourage community participation and decentralize water management, the country's Byzantine bureaucracy ensures that it remains a "mere statement of intent." Responsibility for managing water issues is fragmented among a dozen different ministries and departments without any coordination. The government bureaucracy and state-run project department has failed to solve the problem, despite having spent many years and $500 million on this project.\\n[edit] Recent efforts to address water issues\\n\\nThe government of India envisions a US$100 billion project to interlink all major river networks in India.[34] This initiative would connect water-deficient areas to water-abundant ones by interlinking 37 Indian rivers.[35] One of the largest projects anywhere in the world, it would transfer water through 30 links across 9,600 kilometers. It would connect 32 dams and use 56 million tons of cement and 2 million tons of steel. The project aims a transformation of India's water treatment, management, transmission and distribution. The Indian government has proposed reforms to attract investment and privatization of its water networks. Water companies from all over the world have established a presence in India to pursue an estimated 70 projects worth several billion dollars in 20 Indian cities.[28] India is debating the social and environmental impact of this project. One of the first projects under consideration is the linking of Ken and Betwa rivers in northern India.\\n[edit] Air pollution\\nCooking fuel in rural India is prepared from a wet mix of dried grass, fuelwood pieces, hay, leaves and mostly cow/livestock dung. This mix is patted down into disc-shaped cakes, dried, and then used as fuel in stoves. When it burns, it produces smoke and numerous indoor air pollutants at concentrations 5 times higher than coal.\\nA rural stove using biomass cakes, fuelwood and trash as cooking fuel. Surveys suggest over 100 million households in India use such stoves (chullahs) every day, 2-3 times a day. Clean burning fuels and electricity are unavailable in rural parts and small towns of India because of poor rural highways and limited energy generation infrastructure.\\nAir pollution is high in Indian cities.\\nTraffic congestion on inadequate road infrastructure is a daily reality of India's urban centers. Slow speeds and idling vehicles produce, per trip, 4 to 8 times more pollutants and consume more carbon footprint fuels, than free flowing traffic. This 2008 image shows traffic congestion in Delhi.\\nSee also: Global warming in India\\n\\nFuel wood and biomass burning\\n\\nFuelwood and biomass burning is the primary reason for near-permanent haze and smoke observed above rural and urban India, and in satellite pictures of the country. Fuelwood and biomass cakes are used for cooking and general heating needs. These are burnt in cook stoves known as chullah or chulha in some parts of India. These cook stoves are present in over 100 million Indian households, and are used two to three times a day, daily. As of 2009, majority of Indians still use traditional fuels such as dried cow dung, agricultural wastes, and firewood as cooking fuel.[36] This form of fuel is inefficient source of energy, its burning releases high levels of smoke, PM10 particulate matter, NOX, SOX, PAHs, polyaromatics, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and other air pollutants.[5][37][38][39] Some reports, including one by the World Health Organization, claim 300,000 to 400,000 people die of indoor air pollution and carbon monoxide poisoning in India because of biomass burning and use of chullahs.[40] Burning of biomass and firewood will not stop, unless electricity or clean burning fuel and combustion technologies become reliably available and widely adopted in rural and urban India.\\n\\nIndia is the world's largest consumer of fuelwood, agricultural waste and biomass for energy purposes. From the most recent available nationwide study, India used 148.7 million tonnes coal replacement worth of fuelwood and biomass annually for domestic energy use. India's national average annual per capita consumption of fuel wood, agri wate and biomass cakes was 206 kilogram coal equivalent. In 2010 terms, with India's population increased to about 1.2 billion, the country burns over 200 million tonnes of coal replacement worth of fuel wood and biomass every year to meet its energy need for cooking and other domestic use. The study found that the households consumed around 95 million tonnes of fuelwood, one-third of which was logs and the rest was twigs. Twigs were mostly consumed in the villages, and logs were more popular in cities of India. The overall contribution of fuelwood, including sawdust and wood waste, was about 46% of the total, the rest being agri waste and biomass dung cakes. Traditional fuel (fuelwood, crop residue and dung cake) dominates domestic energy use in rural India and accounts for about 90% of the total. In urban areas, this traditional fuel constitutes about 24% of the total.[41]\\n\\nFuel wood, agri waste and biomass cake burning releases over 165 million tonnes of combustion products into India's indoor and outdoor air every year. To place this volume of emission in context, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the United States estimates that fire wood smoke contributes over 420,000 tonnes of fine particles throughout the United States – mostly during the winter months. United States consumes about one-tenth of fuelwood consumed by India, and mostly for fire place and home heating purposes. EPA estimates that residential wood combustion in the USA accounts for 44 percent of total organic matter emissions and 62 percent of the PAH, which are probable human carcinogens and are of great concern to EPA. The fuelwood sourced residential wood smoke makes up over 50 percent of the wintertime particle pollution problem in California.[42] In 2010, the state of California had about the same number of vehicles as all of India.\\n\\nIndia burns tenfold more fuelwood every year than the United States, the fuelwood quality in India is different than the dry firewood of the United States, and the Indian stoves in use are less efficient thereby producing more smoke and air pollutants per kilogram equivalent. India has less land area and less emission air space than the United States. In summary, the impact on indoor and outdoor air pollution by fuelwood and biomass cake burning is far worse in India.\\n\\nA United Nations study[43] finds firewood and biomass stoves can be made more efficient in India. Animal dung, now used in inefficient stoves, could be used to produce biogas, a cleaner fuel with higher utilization efficiency. In addition, an excellent fertilizer can be produced from the slurry from biogas plants. Switching to gaseous fuels would bring the greatest gains in terms of both thermal efficiency and reduction in air pollution, but would require more investment. A combination of technologies may be the best way forward.\\n\\nBetween 2001 and 2010, India has made progress in adding electrical power generation capacity, bringing electricity to rural areas, and reforming market to improve availability and distribution of liquified cleaner burning fuels in urban and rural area. Over the same period, scientific data collection and analysis show improvement in India's air quality, with some regions witnessing 30 to 65% reduction in NOx, SOx and suspended particulate matter. Even at these lower levels, the emissions are higher than those recommended by the World Health Organization. Continued progress is necessary.\\n\\nScientific studies conclude biomass combustion in India is the country's dominant source of carbonaceous aerosols, emitting 0.25 teragram per year of black carbon into air, 0.94 teragram per year of organic matter, and 2.04 teragram per year of small particulates with diameter less than 2.5 microns. Biomass burning, as domestic fuel in India, accounts for about 3 times as much black carbon air pollution as all other sources combined, including vehicles and industrial sources.[44]\\n\\nOther sources of pollution in Indian cities are vehicles and emissions from industry. Until 1992, India protected its automobile industry using license raj. Many two wheel, three wheel and four wheel vehicles lacked catalytic converters. Per vehicle emissions were amongst the highest in the world. The refining of oil and supply of fuel was owned, regulated and run by the government; the fuel quality was lax.\\n\\nIn 2005, India adopted emission standard of Bharat Stage IV for vehicles, which is equivalent to Euro IV European standards for vehicle emissions. Nevertheless, the old pre-2005 vehicles, and even pre-1992 vehicles are still on Indian streets.\\n\\nFuel adulteration\\n\\nSome Indian taxis and auto-rickshaws run on adulterated fuel blends. Adulteration of gasoline and diesel with lower-priced fuels is common in South Asia, including India.[45] Some adulterants increase emissions of harmful pollutants from vehicles, worsening urban air pollution. Financial incentives arising from differential taxes are generally the primary cause of fuel adulteration. In India and other developing countries, gasoline carries a much higher tax than diesel, which in turn is taxed more than kerosene meant as a cooking fuel, while some solvents and lubricants carry little or no tax. As fuel prices rise, the public transport driver cuts costs by blending the cheaper hydrocarbon into highly taxed hydrocarbon. The blending may be as much as 20-30 percent. For a low wage driver, the adulteration can yield short term savings that are significant over the month. The consequences to long term air pollution, quality of life and effect on health are simply ignored. Also ignored are the reduced life of vehicle engine and higher maintenance costs, particularly if the taxi, auto-rickshaw or truck is being rented for a daily fee.\\n\\nAdulterated fuel increases tailpipe emissions of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). Air toxin emissions — which fall into the category of unregulated emissions — of primary concern are benzene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), both well known carcinogens. Kerosene is more difficult to burn than gasoline; its addition results in higher levels of HC, CO and PM emissions even from catalyst-equipped cars. The higher sulfur level of kerosene is another issue. The permissible level of fuel sulfur in India, in 2002, was 0.25 percent by weight as against 0.10 percent for gasoline. The higher levels of sulfur can deactivate the catalyst. Once the catalyst becomes deactivated, the amount of pollution from the vehicle dramatically increases. Fuel adulteration is essentially an unintended consequence of tax policies and the attempt to control fuel prices, in the name of fairness. Air pollution is the ultimate result. This problem is not unique to India, but prevalent in many developing countries including those outside of south Asia. This problem is largely absent in economies that do not regulate the ability of fuel producers to innovate or price based on market demand.\\n\\nTraffic congestion\\n\\nTraffic congestion is severe in India's cities and towns. Traffic congestion is caused for several reasons, some of which are: increase in number of vehicles per kilometer of available road, a lack of intra-city divided-lane highways and intra-city expressways networks, lack of inter-city expressways, traffic accidents and chaos from poor enforcement of traffic laws.\\n\\nTraffic congestion reduces average traffic speed. At low speeds, scientific studies reveal, vehicles burn fuel inefficiently and pollute more per trip. For example, a study in the United States found that for the same trip, cars consumed more fuel and polluted more if the traffic was congested, than when traffic flowed freely. At average trip speeds between 20 to 40 kilometers per hour, the cars pollutant emission was twice as much as when the average speed was 55 to 75 kilometers per hour. At average trip speeds between 5 to 20 kilometers per hour, the cars pollutant emissions were 4 to 8 times as much as when the average speed was 55 to 70 kilometers per hour.[46] Fuel efficiencies similarly were much worse with traffic congestion.\\n\\nTraffic gridlock in Delhi and other India cities is extreme.[47] The average trip speed on many Indian city roads is less than 20 kilometers per hour; a 10 kilometer trip can take 30 minutes, or more. At such speeds, vehicles in India emit air pollutants 4 to 8 times more than they would with less traffic congestion; Indian vehicles also consume a lot more carbon footprint fuel per trip, than they would if the traffic congestion was less.\\n\\nIn cities like Bangalore, around 50% of children suffer from asthma.[48]\\n\\nRecent trends in India's air quality\\n\\nMonsoons scrub India's air, bringing its natural diversity in better view.\\nHimalayan peaks in eastern India on a day without haze.\\n\\nWith the last 15 years of economic development and regulatory reforms, India has made progress in improving its air quality. The table presents the average emissions sampled at many locations, over time, and data analyzed by scientific methods, by multiple agencies, including The World Bank. For context and comparison, the table also includes average values for Sweden in 2008, observed and analyzed by same methods. Over 1995-2008, average nationwide levels of major air pollutants have dropped by between 25-45 percent in India.\\nAir quality, trends over 1995-2008, averaged for India Air quality indicator[49] 	India 	India 	India 	Sweden\\n	1995 	2005 	2008 	2008\\nPollutant, PM10 (micrograms per cubic meter) 	109 	67 	59 	11\\nPollutant, CO2 emissions (kg per 2005 PPP$ of GDP) 	0.7 	0.6 	0.5 	0.2\\nHealth, mortality rate (under 5, per 1000) 	100 	73 	67 	3\\nPollutant, methane, Agriculture emissions (% total) 	68.8 	64.4 	n.a. 	28.1\\nPollutant, nitrous oxide, Agriculture emissions (% total) 	75.2 	73.4 	n.a. 	60.2\\n\\nIndia's Central Pollution Control Board now routinely monitors four air pollutants namely sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), suspended particulate matter (SPM) and respirable particulate matter (PM10). These are target air pollutants for regular monitoring at 308 operating stations in 115 cities/towns in 25 states and 4 Union Territories of India. The monitoring of meteorological parameters such as wind speed and direction, relative humidity and temperature has also been integrated with the monitoring of air quality. The monitoring of these pollutants is carried out for 24 hours (4-hourly sampling for gaseous pollutants and 8-hourly sampling for particulate matter) with a frequency of twice a week, to yield 104 observations in a year.\\n\\nFor 2010, the key findings of India's central pollution control board are:[50]\\n\\n    * Most Indian cities continue to violate India's and world air quality PM10 targets. Respirable particulate matter pollution remains a key challenge for India. Despite the general non-attainment, some cities showed far more improvement than others. A decreasing trend has been observed in PM10 levels in cities like Solapur and Ahmedabad over the last few years. This improvement may be due to local measures taken to reduce sulphur in diesel and stringent enforcement by Gujarat government.\\n    * A decreasing trend has been observed in sulphur dioxide levels in residential areas of many cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Bhopal during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced clean fuel standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood, and the use of LPG instead of diesel in certain vehicles.\\n    * A decreasing trend has been observed in nitrogen dioxide levels in residential areas of some cities such as Bhopal and Solapur during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced vehicle emission standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood.\\n    * Most Indian cities greatly exceed acceptable levels of suspended particulate matter. This may be because of refuse and biomass burning, vehicles, power plant emissions, industrial sources.\\n    * The Indian air quality monitoring stations reported lower levels of PM10 and suspended particulate matter during monsoon months possibly due to wet deposition and air scrubbing by rainfall. Higher levels of particulates were observed during winter months possibly due to lower mixing heights and more calm conditions. In other words, India's air quality worsens in winter months, and improves with the onset of monsoon season.\\n\\nFor its 2008 annual report, Central Pollution Control Board used 346 operating Air Quality Monitoring Stations, covering 130 cities / towns in 26 States and 4 Union Territories. With the weekly data collected and then averaged over the year, Central Pollution Control Board reported the following annual trends from 1998 to 2008:[24]\\n\\n    * The average annual SOx and NOx emissions level and periodic violations in industrial areas of India were significantly and surprisingly lower than the emission and violations in residential areas of India.\\n    * The 24-hour average PM10 and suspended particulate matter emissions and violations in almost all areas of India violated India's and WHO targets. The PM10 and suspended particulate matter concentrations, in industrial areas of India were, however, lower than those in residential areas of India. Residential areas of India were the source of over 90% of the most serious and repeated violations in particulate air pollution.\\n    * Of the four major Indian cities, air pollution was consistently worst in Delhi, every year over 5 year period (2004–2008). Kolkata was a close second, followed by Mumbai. Chennai air pollution was least of the four.\\n    * The states of Kerala and Meghalaya, relative to other Indian states, experienced on average some of lowest air pollution levels. The cities of Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam and Shillong, relative to other Indian cities and towns, experienced some of lowest air pollution levels.\\n    * Air Quality data collected from the monitoring station at Taj Mahal, Agra since year 1991 to 2008, suggests that both particulate and acid rain pollutants at Taj Mahal have been declining over the years. The 2008 average annual air pollutant concentrations were between 38 to 67% lower than those in 1991.\\n\\n[edit] Solid waste pollution\\nSolid waste adds to water pollution in India, a 2005 image.\\nTrash and garbage disposal services, responsibility of local government workers in India, are ineffective. Solid waste is routinely seen along India's streets and shopping plazas. Image shows solid waste pollution along a Jaipur street, a 2011 image.\\n\\nTrash and garbage is a common sight in urban and rural areas of India. It is a major source of pollution. Indian cities alone generate more than 100 million tons of solid waste a year. Street corners are piled with trash. Public places and sidewalks are despoiled with filth and litter, rivers and canals act as garbage dumps. In part, India's garbage crisis is from rising consumption. India's waste problem also points to a stunning failure of governance.[7]\\n\\nIn 2000, India's Supreme Court directed all Indian cities to implement a comprehensive waste-management program that would include household collection of segregated waste, recycling and composting. These directions have simply been ignored. No major city runs a comprehensive program of the kind envisioned by the Supreme Court. Indeed, forget waste segregation and recycling directive of the India's Supreme Court, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that up to 40 percent of municipal waste in India remains simply uncollected. Even medical waste, theoretically controlled by stringent rules that require hospitals to operate incinerators, is routinely dumped with regular municipal garbage. A recent study found that about half of India's medical waste is improperly disposed of.\\n\\nMunicipalities in Indian cities and towns have waste collection employees. However, these are unionized government workers and their work performance is neither measured nor monitored.\\n\\nSome of the few solid waste landfills India has, near its major cities, are overflowing and poorly managed. They have become significant sources of greenhouse emissions and breeding sites for disease vectors such as flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches, rats, and other pests.[51]\\n\\nIn 2011, several Indian cities embarked on waste-to-energy projects of the type in use in Germany, Switzerland and Japan.[52] For example, New Delhi is implementing two incinerator projects aimed at turning the city’s trash problem into electricity resource. These plants are being welcomed for addressing the city’s chronic problems of excess untreated waste and a shortage of electric power. They are also being welcomed by those who seek to prevent water pollution, hygiene problems, and eliminate rotting trash that produces potent greenhouse gas methane. The projects are being opposed by waste collection workers and local unions who fear changing technology may deprive them of their livelihood and way of life.[53]\\n\\nAlong with waste-to-energy projects, some cities and towns such as Pune, Maharashtra are introducing competition and the privatization of solid waste collection, street cleaning operations and bio-mining to dispose the waste. A scientific study suggests public private partnership is, in Indian context, more useful in solid waste management. According to this study, government and municipal corporations must encourage PPP-based local management through collection, transport and segregation and disposal of solid waste.[54]\\n[edit] Noise pollution\\n[icon] 	This section requires expansion.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court of India gave a significant verdict on noise pollution in 2005.[55] Unnecessary honking of vehicles makes for a high decibel level of noise in cities. The use of loudspeakers for political purposes and by temples and mosques make for noise pollution in residential areas because using more speakers in an programs the noise is increase.\\n\\nIn January 2010, Government of India published norms of permissible noise levels in urban and rural areas.[56]\\n[edit] Land pollution\\n\\nIn March 2009, the issue of Uranium poisoning in Punjab came into light, caused by fly ash ponds of thermal power stations, which reportedly lead to severe birth defects in children in the Faridkot and Bhatinda districts of Punjab.[57][58][59][60]\\n[edit] Environmental issues and Indian law\\n\\nSince about late 1980s, the Supreme Court of India has been pro-actively engaged in India's environmental issues. In most countries, it is the executive and the legislative branches of the government that plan, implement and address environmental issues; the Indian experience is different. The Supreme Court of India has been engaged in interpreting and introducing new changes in the environmental jurisprudence directly. The Court has laid down new principles to protect the environment, re-interpreted environmental laws, created new institutions and structures, and conferred additional powers on the existing ones through a series of directions and judgments. The Court’s directions on environmental issues goes beyond the general questions of law, as is usually expected from the highest Court of a democratic country. The Supreme Court of India, in its order, includes executive actions and technical details of environmental actions to be implemented. Indeed, some critics of India's Supreme Court describe the Court as the Lords of Green Bench or Garbage Supervisor. Supporters of India's Supreme Court term these orders and the Indian bench as pioneering, both in terms of laying down new principles of law, and in delivering environmental justice.[61]\\n\\nThe reasons for the increasing interjection of India's Supreme Court in governance arenas are, experts claim, complex. A key factor has been the failure of government agencies and the state owned enterprises in discharging their Constitutional and Statutory duties. This has prompted civil society groups to file public interest complaints with the Courts, particularly the Supreme Court, for suitable remedies.\\n\\nPublic interest litigation and judicial activism on environmental issues extends beyond India's Supreme Court. It includes the High Courts of individual states.\\n\\nIndia's judicial activism on environmental issues has, some suggest, delivered positive effects to the Indian experience. The Supreme Court has, through intense judicial activism, the proponents claim, become a symbol of hope for the people of India. As a result of judicial activism, India's Supreme Court has delivered a new normative regime of rights and insisted that the Indian state cannot act arbitrarily but must act reasonably and in public interest on pain of its action being invalidated by judicial intervention.[62]\\n\\nIndia's judicial activism on environmental issues has, others suggest, had adverse consequences. Public interest cases are repeatedly filed to block infrastructure projects aimed at solving environmental issues in India, such as but not limiting to water works, expressways, land acquisition for projects, and electricity power generation projects. The litigation routinely delays such projects, often for years, while rampant pollution continues in India, and tens of thousands die from the unintended effects of pollution. Even after a stay related to an infrastructure project is vacated, or a court order gives a green light to certain project, new issues become grounds for court notices and new public interest litigation.[63][64][65]\\n\\nJudicial activism in India has, in several key cases, found state-directed economic development ineffective and a failure, then interpreted laws and issued directives that encourage greater competition and free market to reduce environmental pollution. In other cases, the interpretations and directives have preserved industry protection, labor practices and highly polluting state-owned companies detrimental to environmental quality of India.[66]\\n[edit] Conservation\\nGreater adjutant perched on a pile of trash and solid waste in Assam.\\nThe world's rarest monkey, the golden langur.\\nForests of India's Western Ghats\\nForests of Kerala.

Poor air quality, water pollution and garbage pollution - all affect the food and environment quality necessary for ecosystems.\\n\\nIndia is a large and diverse country. Its land area includes regions with some of the world's highest rainfall to very dry deserts, coast line to alpine regions, river deltas to tropical islands. The variety and distribution of forest vegetation is large. India is one of the 12 mega biodiverse regions of the world.\\n\\nIndian forests types include tropical evergreens, tropical deciduous, swamps, mangroves, sub-tropical, montane, scrub, sub-alpine and alpine forests. These forests support a variety of ecosystems with diverse flora and fauna.\\n\\nUntil recently, India lacked an objective way to determine the quantity of forests it had, and the quality of forests it had.\\n\\nForest cover measurement methods\\n\\nPrior to 1980s, India deployed a bureaucratic method to estimate forest coverage. A land was notified as covered under Indian Forest Act, and then officials deemed this land area as recorded forest even if it was devoid of vegetation. By this forest-in-name-only method, the total amount of recorded forest, per official Indian records, was 71.8 million hectares. Any comparison of forest coverage number of a year before 1987 for India, to current forest coverage in India, is thus meaningless; it is just bureaucratic record keeping, with no relation to reality or meaningful comparison.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, space satellites were deployed for remote sensing of real forest cover. Standards were introduced to classify India's forests into the following categories:\\n\\n    * Forest Cover: defined as all lands, more than one hectare in area, with a tree canopy density of more than 10 percent. (Such lands may or may not be statutorily notified as forest area).\\n          o Very Dense Forest: All lands, with a forest cover with canopy density of 70 percent and above\\n          o Moderately Dense Forest: All lands, with a forest cover with canopy density of 40-70 percent\\n          o Open Forest: All lands, with forest cover with canopy density of 10 to 40 percent\\n          o Mangrove Cover: Mangrove forest is salt tolerant forest ecosystem found mainly in tropical and sub-tropical coastal and/or inter-tidal regions. Mangrove cover is the area covered under mangrove vegetation as interpreted digitally from remote sensing data. It is a part of forest cover and also classified into three classes viz. very dense, moderately dense and open.\\n          o Non Forest Land: defined as lands without any forest cover\\n    * Scrub Cover: All lands, generally in and around forest areas, having bushes and or poor tree growth, chiefly small or stunted trees with canopy density less than 10 percent\\n    * Tree Cover: Land with tree patches (blocks and linear) outside the recorded forest area exclusive of forest cover and less than the minimum mapable area of 1 hectare\\n    * Trees Outside Forests: Trees growing outside Recorded Forest Areas\\n\\nThe first satellite recorded forest coverage data for India became available in 1987. India and the United States cooperated in 2001, using Landsat MSS with spatial resolution of 80 meters, to get accurate Indian forest distribution data. India thereafter switched to digital image and advanced satellites with 23 meters resolution and software processing of images to get more refined data on forest quantity and forest quality. India now assesses its forest distribution data biennially. The 2007 forest census data thus obtained and published by the Government of India suggests the five states with largest area under forest cover as the following:[67]\\n\\n    * Madhya Pradesh: 7.64 million hectares\\n    * Arunachal Pradesh: 6.8 million hectares\\n    * Chhattisgarh: 5.6 million hectares\\n    * Orissa: 4.83 million hectares\\n    * Maharashtra: 4.68 million hectares\\n\\nIndia hosts significant biodiversity; it is home to 7.6% of all mammalian, 12.6% of avian, 6.2% of reptilian, and 6.0% of flowering plant species.[68]\\n\\nIn recent decades, human encroachment has posed a threat to India's wildlife; in response, a system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was substantially expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial habitat; further federal protections were promulgated in the 1980s. Along with over 500 wildlife sanctuaries, India now hosts 14 biosphere reserves, four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; 25 wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.\\n\\nThese laws did not have the effect they intended.\\n\\nIn 1985, India created the Ministry of Environment and Forests. This was followed by a National Forest Policy and the major government reforms of early 1990s.\\n\\nOver the last 20 years, India has reversed the deforestation trend. Specialists of the United Nations report India's forest as well as woodland cover has increased. A 2010 study by the Food and Agriculture Organization ranks India amongst the 10 countries with the largest forest area coverage in the world (the other nine being Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, United States of America, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Australia, Indonesia and Sudan).[12] India is also one the top 10 countries with the largest primary forest coverage in the world, according to this study.\\n\\nFrom 1990 to 2000, FAO finds India was the fifth largest gainer in forest coverage in the world; while from 2000 to 2010, FAO considers India as the third largest gainer in forest coverage.[12]\\n\\nNational Forest Commission and India's afforestation program\\n\\nIn 2003, India set up a National Forest Commission to review and assess India's policy and law, its effect on India's forests, its impact of local forest communities, and to make recommendations to achieve sustainable forest and ecological security in India.[69] The report made over 300 recommendations including the following:\\n\\n    * India must pursue rural development and animal husbandry policies to address local communities need to find affordable cattle fodder and grazing. To avoid destruction of local forest cover, fodder must reach these communities on reliable roads and other infrastructure, in all seasons year round.\\n    * The Forest Rights Bill is likely to be harmful to forest conservation and ecological security. The Forest Rights Bill became a law since 2007.\\n    * The government should work closely with mining companies. Revenue generated from lease of mines must be pooled into a dedicated fund to conserve and improve the quality of forests in the region where the mines are located.\\n    * Power to declare ecologically sensitive areas must be with each Indian state.\\n    * The mandate of State Forest Corporations and government owned monopolies must be changed.\\n    * Government should reform regulations and laws that ban felling of trees and transit of wood within India. Sustainable agro-forestry and farm forestry must be encouraged through financial and regulatory reforms, particularly on privately owned lands.\\n\\nIndia's national forest policy expects to invest US$ 26.7 billion by 2020, to pursue nationwide afforestation coupled with forest conservation, with the goal of increasing India's forest cover from 20% to 33%.[70]
In the natural sciences an isolated system, as contrasted with a open system, is a physical system that does not interact with its surroundings. It obeys a number of conservation laws: its total energy and mass stay constant. They cannot enter or exit, but can only move around inside. An example is in the study of spacetime, where it is assumed that asymptotically flat spacetimes exist.\\n\\nTruly isolated physical systems do not exist in reality (except perhaps for the universe as a whole), because, for example, there is always gravity between a system with mass and masses elsewhere. However, real systems may behave nearly as an isolated system for finite (possibly very long) times. The concept of an isolated system can serve as a useful model approximating many real-world situations.
Reducing body fat has become a common challenge in our 21st century world.  Our days are filled with busy schedules and time restraints.  Hence we take quick and easy meals to satisfy our body metabolism.\\nThese meals may not be what our bodies need.  Our bodies are not able to work at the highest level of functioning; mentally, physically and spiritually.  We require answers to our questions; how we get beyond this challenge and how can we enable a recovery process if our bodies have been neglected in proper nutrition.  What complicates this challenge is the fact that every human being is different and requires different nutrients.\\n\\nThrough searching out and finding our body types we are able to assist in discovering the best nutrition and thus achieve the highest level of body functioning.

{{onesource|date=December 2015}}\\n{{short description|Type of emergency that causes severe environmental damage}}\\nAn '''environmental emergency''' is defined as a "sudden-onset disaster or accident resulting from natural, technological or human-induced factors, or a combination of these, that causes or threatens to cause severe environmental damage as well as loss of human lives and property." (UNEP/GC.22/INF/5, 13 November 2002.)\\n\\nFollowing a disaster or conflict, an environmental emergency can occur when people's health and livelihoods are at risk due to the release of hazardous and noxious substances, or because of significant damage to the ecosystem. Examples include fires, [[oil spill]]s, [[chemical accident]]s, [[toxic waste dump]]ing and [[groundwater pollution]]. \\n\\nThe environmental risks can be acute and life-threatening. According to the International Disaster Database ([http://www.emdat.be/ EM-DAT]), between 2003 and 2013, there were 380 industrial accidents reported, affecting 207 668 people and resulting in over US$22 million in losses. Climate change is having an unprecedented effect on the occurrence of natural disasters and the associated risk of environmental emergencies. With climate change already stretching the disaster relief system, future climate-related emergency events will generate increased and more costly demands for assistance.\\n\\n== Context ==\\nAll disasters have some environmental impacts.  \\n\\nSome of these may be immediate and life-threatening – for example, when an earthquake damages an industrial facility, which in turn releases hazardous materials. In such cases these so-called 'secondary impacts' may cause as much damage as the initial causal factor. \\n\\nFor example, [[Typhoon Haiyan]]/Yolanda that struck the Philippines in November 2013, caused massive destruction and had a huge human toll but also generated a spill of around 800,000 litres of heavy oil, when a power barge ran aground in Estancia, Iloilo province, at the height of the typhoon. \\n\\nDisasters may also have longer-term impacts. For example, natural disasters may cause long-term waste management difficulties or [[ecosystem]] damage.\\n\\n== Major international conferences ==\\nThe Environmental Emergencies Forum is a unique biennial international forum that brings together disaster managers and environmental experts from governments, [[UN]] agencies, industries, academies, NGOs and civil society to improve prevention, preparedness, response and overall resilience to environmental emergencies. It also provides guidance for the Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit, which provides a Secretariat to the meeting. The most recent meeting was held in Norway in June 2015. The next meeting will be held in Nairobi in June 2017.\\n\\n== Relevant organizations ==\\n\\n===United Nations===\\nThe Joint [http://www.unep.org/ United Nations Environment Programme] (UNEP)/[http://www.unocha.org/ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs] (OCHA) Environment Unit (JEU): By pairing the UNEP's technical expertise with OCHA's humanitarian response network, the Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit (JEU) mobilizes and coordinates a comprehensive response to environmental emergencies to protect lives, livelihoods, ecosystems and future generations. The JEU can be reached 24 hours/day, seven days/week, all year round and operates at the request of affected countries.

Silver was probably one of the first metals smelted from ore. Silver goes back to the times of the ancient Byzantine, Phoenician and Egyptian empires. Other than jewelry, silver has been forged into domestic utensils, buttons, boxes and other articles. Other than liquid mercury, silver is the brightest reflector among metals. This allows it to be polished to sheen. The Latin word for silver is Ag - Argentum that stands for 'white and shining'.\\n\\nAncient silver jewelry was handed down the generations among North and South American natives. Silver is extensively mined in the ores of Mexico and Peru. The comparatively low price of silver makes it a popular metal for jewelry, especially for fine and innovative designs. Silver jewelry craftsmen experiment with silver and later duplicate their patterns with gold.\\n\\nSilver jewelry is popular with women who want to achieve a less-formal look. Silver jewelry is popularly gifted to women and children. Even men can be gifted silver cuff links, tiepins or signet rings. It is representative of a tender emotion or a lovely memory. Sterling silver jewelry carries a stamp of sophistication without being over the top. Find out how to care for your silver jewelry.
\\nLove is an emotion of a strong affection and personal attachment.[1] Love is also a virtue representing all of human kindness, compassion, and affection; and "the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another".[2] Love may also be described as actions towards others or oneself based on compassion, or as actions towards others based on affection.[3] In English, love refers to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from pleasure ("I loved that meal") to interpersonal attraction ("I love my partner"). "Love" may refer specifically to the passionate desire and intimacy of romantic love, to the sexual love of eros, to the emotional closeness of familial love, to the platonic love that defines friendship,[4] or to the profound oneness or devotion of religious love.[5] This diversity of uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states. Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts.[6] Love may be understood as part of the survival instinct, a function to keep human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.
{{User:Kpalion/Polish cuisine sidebox}}\\n\\nThe '''history of [[Polish cuisine]]''' has been shaped by such factors as the country's climate, a mostly agrarian lifestyle with parallel strains of rustic and luxurious culinary tradition, religious dietary requirements of the Catholic Church, external influences coming from various directions, as well as periods of scarcity and culinary monotony, notably during the Second World and Cold Wars. \\n\\nDue to Poland's location in a moderate temperate climate with frosty winters and a relatively short growing season, storage of food for several colder months, when fresh produce becomes largely unavailable, is a necessity. Before the advent of modern preservation techniques, such pasteurization and refrigeration, Poles relied on such traditional methods as salting-curing, pickling by lactic fermentation or acidification in vinegar, as well as smoking and drying. As a result, salty, sour and smoky flavors are typical of many Polish foods. Traditional Polish cooking is highly seasonal. ''Add examples of foods availably only during certain seasons.''\\n\\nThe official adoption of Western-rite Christianity in the 10th century CE meant that the natural seasonality has been compounded with the Roman Catholic liturgical calendar of alternating festive and fasting periods. Polish people still associate certain foods with specific religious holidays, such as Easter and Christmas. Many Poles fast every Friday, the day of the week associated with the crucifixion of Jesus, by refraining from eating land-animal meat and opting for fish instead.\\n\\nThroughout most of Poland's history, it was a predominantly agricultural country with a large portion of the population living off the fields and pastures which they tended themselves. An agrarian lifestyle with an emphasis on self-sufficience has played an important role in the shaping of Polish cuisine. Food production has always been supplemented with foraging and hunting in forests, enriching\\nthe Polish table with a variety of berries, mushrooms and game. An income gap, which grew in the early modern period between the peasants and petty nobility on the one hand and affluent grain-exporting magnates on the other, led to two separate strains in Polish culinary history – a simple rustic fare dominated by groats and flour-based foods, cabbage and root vegetables, as well as animal fats as a substitute for meat, versus lordly cuisine featuring choice meats, expensive sugar and exotic spices. The latter was played down under the Communist regime, but has been making a comeback in the 21st century and Polish cuisine draws from both currents today.\\n\\n* foreign influence: English, French, Italian, German, Czech, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Russian, Tatar, Jewish, Armenian, Turkish, etc.\\n* periods of scarcity: importance of culinary creativity\\n\\n{{TOC limit|3}}\\n\\n== Middle Ages ==\\n{{See also|Medieval cuisine|Regional cuisines of medieval Europe}}\\n[[File:Ur-painting.jpg|thumb|Copy of a 16th-century painting of an aurochs]]\\nInformation about Polish medieval cuisine is scant.

The [[Heracleum mantegazzianum|giant hogweed]], known in Polish as ''barszcz'', was used to make a soup to which it lent its name.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=126–129}} Additionally, apples, pears, plums, sweet and sour cherries, and hazelnuts were grown in the orchards.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=132}} \\n\\nAll social groups consumed fairly large amounts of meat, mostly pork. Pigs, resembling small wild boars, were grazed in oak and beech forests.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|p=56}} Cattle was raised mostly for draft and milk, so beef was a more expensive treat. Both of these kinds of meat, as well as poultry, were usually spit-roasted, but also stewed, boiled, barbecued or pickled in their own jelly.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=83–94}} The immense forests, which then covered most of the country, were a source of game, which served as an important addition to the meat of domestic animals. Poles commonly hunted the small game, such as hares, [[beaver]]s, [[badger]]s, [[Grey Partridge|partridges]], and [[black grouse]], and occasionally the big game, from [[roe deer]] to [[red deer]], elk ([[moose]]), wild boars, bears, [[European bison|wisent]], to [[aurochs]], the now-extinct ancestor of domestic cattle.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=84–85, 94–96}}\\n\\n* Seasonality, pickled vegetables, salted meat, ''rosół''\\n* [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church]].

'''Patrick Shanahan:  artist-photographer'''\\n\\nPatrick Shanahan (born Manchester, England, 1955) is a British artist-photographer whose photographs investigate the contemporary cultural landscape, offering a seductive and unsettling re-imaging of modern urban environments.\\n\\nMaking full use of the scenographic, artificial aspects of large-scale photography, he produces topographic images that are close to the kinds of minimalism found in painting and sculpture. These largely unpopulated compositions are subjected to a pristine finish and treatment of light, colour and space that help to establish a tension between a real and constructed landscape - a landscape in which the distinction between reality and imagination seem to blur and we are left with a peculiar sense of spatial estrangement.\\n\\nShanahan works with a variety of medium and large-format cameras and shoots on colour negative film. The film is digitally scanned and then worked on in Photoshop. Large-scale chromogenic dye-coupler prints are produced in limited editions - see artist website for details.\\n\\nThe result is hyperreal and illusory images that transform the environs we may be used to seeing into something disturbing and strange - images that pose the artificial and natural in opposition to one another. We feel simultaneously connected to and spatially estranged from them and, in blurring the distinction between reality and imagination, his photographs alter the way we see and relate to the world.
Power Electronics Education E-Book\\n\\nwww.peeeb.com\\n\\nDr. Firuz Zare\\n\\n'Globalization' is a simple way of describing the spread of communication and technologies across the world. As the store of knowledge expands throughout the world, all of the world’s people should have as much access as possible. There are a range of new technologies and techniques such as the Internet, World Wide Web and other electronic media forms that allow for the dissemination of data, information and knowledge. These advanced information and communications technologies can provide a new learning system that aid professors and students in breaking the boundaries of space and time and assist students in gaining the skills and abilities and utilise knowledge contained in various forms in our global. I believe there is a need for enhanced virtual and networked activity to support learning and share our knowledge especially in some developing countries! After many years working in industry and university, I have decided to share my knowledge and experience with all students in the world who study Electrical Engineering. Now, it is not a dream anymore! In this website, you can virtually attend my lectures, tutorials, computer Labs and quizzes and also access to lecture notes.
ALIA Institute\\n\\nThe ALIA Institute is a non-profit charitable organization located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It aims to support community and organizational leaders by bringing together systems-oriented tools and perspectives with the values and practices of authentic leadership. \\n\\nThe Institute began in 1998 as a dialogue among members of the Shambhala meditation community who were actively engaged in business, education, and civil society, and pioneering leaders in the fields of organizational and societal change - pathfinders such as Peter Senge, Margaret Wheatley, Juanita Brown, David Isaacs, and Art Kleiner. The intention behind this exploration was to discover a new model of leadership development that would adequately prepare organizational leaders for the challenges of the 21st century. This model would bring together Shambhala, as a source of pre-industrial wisdom and practices for realizing the potential of individuals and societies, with post-industrial research and methodologies related to leadership and whole-systems change.\\n\\nThis fusion turned out to be a powerful support for more effective action, especially in the domains of innovation, strategy, collaboration, and large-scale transformative change. It resulted in the week-long Authentic Leadership Summer Program, which was first offered in Nova Scotia in June 2001 and which has convened annually ever since.
"Anorexia mirabilis literally means "miraculous lack of appetite". It refers almost exclusively to women and girls of the Middle Ages who would starve themselves, sometimes to the death, in the name of God. The phenomenon is also known by the name "inedia prodigiosa" (a great starvation).[1]\\n\\nAnorexia mirabilis differs from the more modern, well-known anorexia nervosa in several distinct ways.\\n\\nIn anorexia nervosa, people usually starve themselves to attain a level of thinness, as the disease is associated with body image distortion. By contrast, anorexia mirabilis was frequently coupled with other ascetic practices, such as lifelong chastity, flagellant behavior, the donning of hairshirts, sleeping on beds of thorns, and other assorted self mutilations. It was largely a practice of Catholic women, who were often known as "miraculous maids".\\n\\nUntil recently, plumpness was a clear sign of affluence, and emaciation either a sign of poverty, ill health, or both. Women did not typically begin depriving themselves of food for outer beauty until the Victorian era, they did however starve themselves for spiritual fulfillment."
{{Business administration}}\\n{{short description|Trade of goods, services, technology, capital's and/or knowledge at a transnational scale}}\\n'''International business''' refers to the trade of Goods and service goods, services, technology, capital and/or knowledge across national borders and at a global or transnational scale. \\n\\nIt involves cross-border [[Financial transaction|transactions]] of goods and services between two or more countries. Transactions of economic resources include capital, skills, and people for the purpose of the international production of physical goods and services such as finance, banking, insurance, and construction. International business is also known as [[globalization]].\\n\\nInternational business encompasses a myriad of crucial elements vital for global economic integration and growth. At its core, it involves the exchange of goods, services, and capital across national borders. One of its pivotal aspects is globalization, which has significantly altered the landscape of trade by facilitating increased interconnectedness between nations. International business thrives on the principle of comparative advantage, wherein countries specialize in producing goods and services they can produce most efficiently. This specialization fosters efficiency, leading to optimal resource allocation and higher overall productivity. Moreover, international business fosters cultural exchange and understanding by promoting interactions between people of diverse backgrounds. However, it also poses challenges, such as navigating complex regulatory frameworks, cultural differences, and geopolitical tensions. Effective international business strategies require astute market analysis, risk assessment, and adaptation to local customs and preferences. The role of technology cannot be overstated, as advancements in communication and transportation have drastically reduced barriers to entry and expanded market reach. Additionally, international business plays a crucial role in sustainable development, as companies increasingly prioritize ethical practices, environmental responsibility, and social impact. Collaboration between governments, businesses, and international organizations is essential to address issues like climate change, labor rights, and economic inequality. In essence, international business is a dynamic force driving economic growth, fostering global cooperation, and shaping the future of commerce on a worldwide scale.\\n\\nTo conduct business overseas, multinational companies need to bridge separate national [[Market (economics)|markets]] into one global marketplace. There are two macro-scale factors that underline the trend of greater globalization. The first consists of eliminating [[Trade barrier|barriers]] to make cross-border trade easier (e.g. free flow of goods and services, and capital, referred to as "[[free trade]]"). The second is technological change, particularly developments in communication, [[Electronic data processing|information processing]], and [[Freight transport|transportation]] technologies.\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nThe discourse surrounding international business has  a transition in terminology over the years, reflecting shifts in understanding and the expanding scope of cross-border commerce. Initially, phrases such as "foreign trade" and "foreign exchange" were prevalent, embodying a static view of cross-border interactions. However, the term "foreign" often evoked notions of remoteness or strangeness, failing to capture the dynamic essence of international engagements.\\n\\nAs commerce evolved with the advent of firms engaging in substantial direct investments across borders, newer terms  to encapsulate the changing landscape. The mid-19th century marked the rise of companies owning and controlling production facilities in various countries, a departure from the earlier norm where firms held minor or passive ("portfolio") investments abroad. This paradigm shift necessitated a fresh nomenclature, leading to the introduction of the term "multinational enterprise" (MNE), referring to entities with substantial operations in multiple nations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burleigh |first1=Thomas D. |title=The Indian Tree Pipit (Anthus hodgsoni) Recorded for the First Time in North America |journal=The Auk |date=1968 |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=323 |doi=10.2307/4083598 |jstor=4083598 }}</ref>\\n\\n"International business" is also defined as the study of the internationalization process of multinational enterprises. A [[multinational enterprise]] (MNE) is a company that has a worldwide approach to markets, production and/or operations in several countries. Well-known MNEs include fast-food companies such as: McDonald's (MCD), YUM (YUM), Starbucks Coffee Company (SBUX), etc. Other industrial MNEs leaders include vehicle manufacturers such as: Ford Motor Company, and General Motors (GMC). Some consumer electronics producers such as Samsung, LG and Sony, and energy companies such as Exxon Mobil, and British Petroleum (BP) are also multinational enterprises.\\n\\nMultinational enterprises range from any kind of business activity or market, from consumer goods to machinery manufacture; a company can become an international business. Therefore, to conduct business overseas, companies should be aware of all the factors that might affect any business activities, including, but not limited to: difference in legal systems, political systems, [[economic policy]], [[language barrier|language]], [[accounting standard]]s, [[International labour law|labor standards]], living standards, [[environmental standard]]s, [[culture|local culture]]s, [[Organizational culture|corporate cultures]], [[Foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange markets]], [[tariff]]s, [[import]] and [[export]] regulations, [[trade agreement]]s, [[climate]], and [[education]]. Each of these factors may require changes in how companies operate from one country to another. Each factor makes a difference and a connection.\\n\\nOne of the first scholars to engage in developing a theory of multinational companies was Canadian economist [[Stephen Hymer]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Buckley |first1=Peter J. |title=Stephen Hymer: Three phases, one approach? |journal=International Business Review |date=April 2006 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=140–147 |doi=10.1016/j.ibusrev.2005.03.008 }}</ref> Throughout his academic life, he developed theories that sought to explain [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) and why firms become multinational.\\n\\nThere were three phases of [[internationalization]] according to Hymer's work.<ref>{{cite thesis |last1=Hymer |first1=Stephen H. |title=The international operations of national firms, a study of direct foreign investment |date=1960 |hdl=1721.1/27375 |hdl-access=free }}{{pn|date=March 2024}}</ref> In this thesis, the author departs from [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical theory]] and opens up a new area of international production. At first, Hymer started analyzing neoclassical theory and [[financial investment]], where the main reason for [[capital movement]] is the [[Interest rate parity|difference in interest rates]]. After this analysis, Hymer analyzed the characteristics of foreign investment by large companies for [[Production (economics)|production]] and direct business purposes, calling this Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). By analyzing the two types of investments, Hymer distinguished financial investment from direct investment. The main distinguishing feature was control. [[Portfolio investment]] is a more passive approach, and the main purpose is [[Profit (economics)|financial gain]], whereas in foreign direct investment a firm has control over the [[Operations management|operations]] abroad. So, the traditional theory of investment based on differential interest rates does not explain the motivations for FDI.\\n\\nAccording to Hymer, there are two main determinants of FDI; where an [[imperfect market]] structure is the key element. The first is the [[Competitive advantage|firm-specific advantages]] which are developed at the specific companies home country and, profitably, used in the foreign country. The second determinant is the removal of control where Hymer wrote: "When firms are interconnected, they [[Competition (economics)|compete]] in selling in the same market or one of the firms may sell to the other," and because of this "it may be profitable to substitute centralized decision-making for [[decentralized decision-making]]".\\n\\nHymer's second phase is his neoclassical article in 1968 that includes a theory of internationalization and explains the direction of growth of the international expansion of firms. In a later stage, Hymer went to a more [[Marxian economics|Marxist]] approach where he explains that MNC as agents of an international capitalist system causing conflict and contradictions, causing among other things [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[poverty]] in the world. Hymer is the "father of the theory of MNEs", and explains the motivations for companies doing direct business abroad.\\n\\nAmong modern economic theories of multinationals and foreign direct investment are [[internalization theory]] and [[John Harry Dunning|John Dunning's]] [[Eclectic paradigm|OLI paradigm]] (standing for ''ownership, location and internationalization''). Dunning was widely known for his research in economics of international direct investment and the multinational enterprise. His OLI paradigm, in particular, remains as the predominant theoretical contribution to study international business topics. Hymer and Dunning are considered [[Organizational founder|founders]] of international business as a specialist [[field of study]].\\n\\n==Physical and social factors of competitive business and social environment==\\nThe conduct of international operations depends on a company's objectives and the means with which they carry them out. The operations affect and are affected by the physical and societal factors and the [[competitive]] [[social environment|environment]].\\n\\n===Operations===\\nAll firms that want to go international have one goal in common; the desire to increase their respective [[Economic value added|economic values]] when engaging in international trade transactions. To accomplish this goal, each firm must develop its individual strategy and approach to maximize [[Value (economics)|value]], lower costs, and increase profits.  A firm's value creation is the difference between {{Math|''V''}} (the value of the product being sold) and {{Math|''C''}} (the cost of production per each product sold).{{sfn|Hill|2014|p=382}}\\n\\n[[Value creation]] can be categorized as: ''primary activities'' ([[research and development]], production, marketing and sales, [[customer service]]) and as ''support activities'' (information systems, logistics, human resources).{{sfn|Hill|2014|p=383}} All of these activities must be managed effectively and be consistent with the [[Corporate strategy|firm strategy]]. However, the success of firms that extend internationally depends on the goods or services sold and on the firm's core competencies (Skills within the firm that competitors cannot easily match or imitate). For a firm to be successful, the firm's strategy must be consistent with the environment in which the firm operates. Therefore, the firm needs to change its [[organizational structure]] to reflect changes in the setting in which they are operating and the strategy they are pursuing.\\n\\nOnce a firm decides to enter a foreign market, it must decide on a mode of entry. There are six different modes to enter a foreign market, and each mode has [[wiktionary:pros and cons|pros and cons]] that are associated with it. The firm must decide which mode is most appropriately aligned with the company's goals and objectives.  The six different modes of entry are exporting,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp|title=Export|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-19|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}</ref> [[turnkey project]]s, [[License|licensing]], [[franchising]], establishing [[joint venture]]s with a host-country firm, or setting up a new [[wholly owned subsidiary]] in the host country.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=453–454}}\\n\\nThe first entry mode is [[exporting]]. Exporting is the sale of a product in a different national market than a centralized hub of manufacturing. In this way, a firm may realize a substantial [[Economies of scale|scale of economies]] from its global sales revenue. As an example, many [[Automotive industry in Japan|Japanese automakers]] made inroads into the [[Automotive industry in the United States|U.S. market]] through exporting.  There are two primary advantages to exporting:  avoiding high costs of establishing manufacturing in a host country (when these are higher) and gaining an [[Experience curve effects|experience curve]].  Some possible disadvantages to exporting are high transport costs and high [[Tariff|tariff barriers]].{{sfn|Hill|2014|p=454}}\\n\\nThe second entry mode is a turnkey project. In a turnkey project, an independent contractor is hired by the company to oversee all of the preparation for entering a foreign market.  Once the preparation is complete and the end of the contract is reached, the plant is turned over to the company fully ready for operation.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=454–455}}\\n\\nLicensing and franchising are two additional entry modes that are similar in operation. Licensing allows a [[licensor]] to grant the rights to an intangible property to the licensee for a specified period of time for a royalty fee. Franchising, on the other hand, is a specialized form of licensing in which the "franchisor" sells the [[intangible property]] to the franchisee, and also requires the franchisee operate as dictated by the franchisor.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=456–457}}\\n\\nLastly, a joint venture and wholly owned subsidiary are two more entry modes in international business. A ''joint venture'' is when a firm created is jointly owned by two or more companies (Most joint venture are 50-50 [[partnership]]s). This is in contrast with a wholly owned subsidiary, when a firm owns 100 percent of the [[Capital stock|stock]] of a company in a foreign country because it has either set up a new operation or [[Corporate acquisition|acquires]] an established firm in that country.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=457–458}}\\n\\n====Types of operations====\\n[[Export]]s and [[import]] \\n* Merchandise exports: goods exported{{Em dash}}not including services.<ref>[http://thelawdictionary.org/merchandise-exports/ What is Merchandised Exports].

These channels play a crucial role in keeping stakeholders informed about global market trends, emerging opportunities, and potential risks. Here are some of the key types of international business media:\\n\\n*Industry-Specific Publications:* Specialized magazines, journals, and newsletters that focus on particular industries or sectors, providing in-depth analysis, expert commentary, and industry news.\\n\\n*Financial News Outlets:* Global media organizations that report on financial markets, economic developments, and business performance, offering insights into investment opportunities and economic trends.\\n\\n*Business Television Networks:* Broadcast and online channels dedicated to business news, featuring interviews with CEOs, market analysis, and reports on global business events.\\n\\n*Online Business Resources:* Websites, blogs, and social media platforms that provide news, analysis, and commentary on international business, often catering to specific regions or industries.\\n\\nIn addition  to traditional media, there are also a number of social media channels that focus on international business. These channels can be a good way to stay up-to-date on the latest news and developments, and they can also be a valuable platform for connecting with other businesses and professionals.\\n\\n===Physical and social factors===\\n* Geographical influences: There are many different geographic factors that affect international business. These factors are: the geographical size, the [[Climate change|climatic challenges]] happening throughout the world, the [[natural resource]]s available on a specific territory, the [[Population density|population distribution]] in a country, etc.<ref name=witiger>\\nWitiger, (2012).

The use of conventional [[SWOT analysis]], [[market research]], and cultural research, will give a firm appropriate tools to reduce risk of failure abroad. Risks that arise from poor planning include: large expenses in marketing, administration and product development (with no sales); disadvantages derived from local or federal laws of a foreign country, lack of popularity because of a [[Market saturation|saturated market]], vandalism of physical property due to instability of country; etc. There are also cultural risks when entering a foreign market.

The government might be [[Corruption|corrupt]], hostile, or [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]; and may have a negative image around the globe. A firm's reputation can change if it operates in a country controlled by that type of government.<ref name="okolo2"/> Also, an unstable political situation can be a risk for multinational firms. [[Elections]] or any unexpected political event can change a country's situation and put a firm in an awkward position.<ref name=heinsz>J. Henisz, W. and A. Zelner, B. (2010).

Accessed 9 May 2015.</ref> Political risks are the likelihood that political forces will cause drastic changes in a country's business environment that hurt the profit and other goals of a business enterprise. Political risk tends to be greater in countries experiencing [[social unrest]]. When political risk is high, there is a high probability that a change will occur in the country's political environment that will endanger foreign firms there. Corrupt foreign governments may also [[Expropriation|take over the company without warning]], as seen in Venezuela.<ref name="Charles H.L Hill">Charles H.L Hill</ref>\\n*'''Technological risk'''\\n\\nTechnological improvements bring many benefits, but some disadvantages as well. Some of these risks include "lack of [[Information security|security in electronic transactions]], the [[Non-recurring engineering|cost of developing new technology]] ... the fact that this new technology may fail, and, when all of these are coupled with the outdated existing technology, [the fact that] the result may create a dangerous effect in doing business in the international arena."<ref name="okolo2"/>\\n* '''Environmental risk'''\\n\\nCompanies that establish a subsidiary or factory abroad need to be conscious about the externalizations they will produce, as some may have negative effects such as [[Noise pollution|noise]] or [[pollution]].  This may cause aggravation to the people living there, which in turn can lead to a conflict. People want to live in a clean and quiet environment, without pollution or unnecessary noise. If a conflict arises, this may lead to a negative change in customer's perception of the company. Actual or potential threat of adverse effects on living organisms and environment by effluents, emissions, wastes, [[resource depletion]], etc., arising out of an organization's activities is considered to be risks of the environment. As new business leaders come to fruition in their careers, it will be increasingly important to curb business activities and externalizations that may hurt the environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/environmental-risk.html|title=What is environmental risk? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|access-date=27 March 2018|archive-date=19 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200919103509/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/environmental-risk.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\\n\\n* '''Economic risk''' \\nThese are the economic risks explained by Professor Okolo: "This comes from the inability of a country to meet its financial obligations. The changing of foreign-investment or/and domestic fiscal or monetary policies. The effect of exchange-rate and interest rate make it difficult to conduct international business."<ref name="okolo2"/> Moreover, it can be a risk for a company to operate in a country and they may experience an unexpected economic crisis after establishing the subsidiary.<ref name=heinsz /> Economic risks is the likelihood that economic management will cause drastic changes in a country's business environment that hurt the profit and other goals of a business enterprise. In practice, the biggest problem arising from economic mismanagement has been inflation. Historically many governments have expanded their domestic money supplying misguided attempts to stimulate economic activity.<ref name="Charles H.L Hill"/>\\n* '''Financial risk'''\\n\\nAccording to Professor Okolo: "This area is affected by the currency exchange rate, government flexibility in allowing the firms to [[Repatriation|repatriate]] profits or funds outside the country. The [[devaluation]] and inflation will also affect the firm's ability to operate at an efficient capacity and still be stable."<ref name="okolo2"/> Furthermore, the [[tax]]es that a company has to pay might be advantageous or not. It might be higher or lower in the host countries. Then "the risk that a government will indiscriminately change the laws, regulations, or contracts governing an investment—or will fail to [[Enforcement|enforce]] them—in a way that reduces an investor's [[financial return]]s is what we call 'policy risk.'"<ref name=heinsz /> Exchange rates can fluctuate rapidly for a variety of reasons, including economic instability and diplomatic issues. <ref>{{cite web |title=These Are Four Risks of Doing International Business |url=https://www.bnsgoglobal.com/four-risks-of-doing-international-business/ |website=Business Navigational Solutions |date=27 March 2022 |access-date=3 May 2022}}</ref>\\n* '''Terrorism'''\\n\\n[[Terrorism]] is a voluntary act of violence towards a group(s) of people. In most cases, acts of terrorism is derived from hatred of religious, political and cultural beliefs. An example was the infamous [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], labeled as terrorism due to the [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks|massive damages]] inflicted on [[Society of the United States|American society]] and the global economy stemming from the animosity towards [[Western culture]] by some [[Radical Islam|radical Islamic groups]]. Terrorism not only affects civilians, but it also damages corporations and other businesses. These effects may include: physical [[vandalism]] or [[destruction of property]], sales declining due to frightened consumers and governments issuing public safety restrictions. Firms engaging in international business will find it difficult to operate in a country that has an uncertain assurance of safety from these attacks.<ref name="okolo2"/>\\n* '''Bribery'''\\n\\n[[Bribery]] is the act of receiving or soliciting of any items or services of value to influence the actions of a party with public or legal obligations. This is considered to an unethical form of practicing business and can have legal repercussions. Firm that want to operate legally should instruct employees to not involve themselves or the company in such activities. Companies should avoid doing business in countries where unstable forms of government exist as it could bring unfair advantages against domestic business and/or harm the social fabric of the citizens.\\n\\n==Factors towards globalization==\\nThere has been growth in [[globalization]] in recent decades due to the following factors.\\n\\n{{List incomplete|date=November 2018}}\\n\\n*[[Technology]] is expanding, especially in [[transportation]] and [[communications]].\\n*[[Governments]] are removing international business restrictions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\\n*[[Institutions]] provide services to ease the conduct of international business.\\n*[[Consumer]]s want to know about [[Foreign trade|foreign]] [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[service (economics)|services]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\\n*[[Competition]] has become more global.\\n*[[Political]] relationships have improved among some major [[economic]] powers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\\n*[[Countries]] cooperate more on transnational issues.\\n*[[Cross-national cooperation and agreements]] have increased.\\n\\n==Importance of international business education==\\n* Most companies are either international companies or [[Competition (economics)|compete]] with other international companies.\\n* Modes of [[Business operations|operation]] may differ from those used domestically.\\n* The best way of conducting business may differ by [[country]].\\n* An understanding helps one make better [[career]] decisions.\\n* An understanding helps one decide what [[Government policy|governmental policies]] to support.\\n\\nManagers in international business must understand [[social science]] disciplines and how they affect different functional business fields.\\n\\nTo maintain and achieve successful business operations in foreign nations, persons must understand how variations in culture and traditions across nations affect business practices. This idea is known as [[cultural literacy]]. Without knowledge of a host country's culture, corporate strategizing is more difficult and error-prone when entering foreign markets compared with the home country's market and culture. This can create a "blind spot" during the decision making process and result in [[ethnocentrism]]. Education about international business introduces the student to new concepts that can be applicable in international strategy in topics such as marketing and operations.\\n\\n===Importance of language and cultural studies===\\n\\nA considerable advantage in international business is gained through the knowledge and use of language, thereby mitigating a [[language barrier]]. A study by Lohmann (2011) in ''Economics Letters'' delved into the impact of language barriers on trade. The findings suggest that fluency in the local language can significantly enhance trade interactions.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lohmann |first=Johannes |date=2011-02-01 |title=Do language barriers affect trade? |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176510003617 |journal=Economics Letters |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=159–162 |doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2010.10.023 |issn=0165-1765}}</ref> Advantages of being an international businessperson who is [[Fluency|fluent]] in the [[local language]] include the following:\\n*Having the ability to directly communicate with employees and customers\\n*Understanding the manner of speaking within business in the local area to improve overall [[productivity]]\\n*Gaining respect of customers and employees from speaking with them in their native tongue\\n\\nIn many cases, it plays a crucial role. It is truly impossible to gain an understanding of a culture's buying habits without first taking the time to understand the culture.  Examples of the benefit of understanding local culture include the following:\\n*Being able to provide marketing techniques that are specifically tailored to the local market\\n*Knowing how other businesses operate and what might or might not be social taboos \\n*Understanding the time structure of an area.  Some societies are more focused on timeliness ("[[Punctuality|being on time]]") while others focus on doing business at "[[Business hours|the right time]]".\\n*Associating with people who do not know several languages.\\n*Language barriers can affect transaction costs. ''[[Linguistic distance]]'' is defined as the amount of variation one language has from another. For example, French, and Spanish are both languages derived from Latin. When evaluating dialogue in these languages, you will discover many similarities. However, languages such as English and Chinese or English and Arabic vary much more strongly and contain far fewer similarities. The [[writing system]]s of these languages are also different. The larger the linguistic distance there, the wider language barriers to cross. These differences can reflect on transaction costs and make foreign business operations more expensive.\\n\\n===Importance of studying international business===\\n\\nThe international business standards focus on the following:\\n*raising awareness of the inter-relatedness of one country's political policies and economic practices on another;\\n*learning to improve international business relations through appropriate communication strategies;\\n*understanding the global business environment—that is, the interconnections of cultural, political, legal, economic, and ethical systems;\\n*exploring basic concepts underlying [[international finance]], [[management]], [[marketing]], and trade relations; and\\n*identifying forms of business [[ownership]] and international business opportunities.\\nBy focusing on these, students will gain a better understanding of [[Political economy]]. These are tools that would help future business people bridge the economic and political gap between countries.\\n\\nThere is an increasing amount of demand for business people with an education in international business. A survey conducted by Thomas Patrick from [[University of Notre Dame]] concluded that [[bachelor's degree]] and [[master's degree]] holders felt that the training received through education were very practical in the working environment. Increasingly, companies are sourcing their human resource requirement globally. For example, at [[Sony|Sony Corporation]], only fifty percent of its employees are Japanese.<ref>{{Cite book|title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS|author=ASWATHAPPA|year=2003 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9781259051166}}</ref> Business people with an education in international business also had a significantly higher chance of being sent abroad to work under the international operations of a firm.\\n\\nThe following table provides descriptions of [[higher education]] in international business and its benefits.\\n{| class="wikitable"\\n|-\\n!  !!

Digital Libraries are catering to information services interacting with online databases of journals and other resources Digital Library are important in creating, indexing and retrieving the various forms of digital resources.
Flipgigs is an online talent based student services marketplace connecting savvy consumers and businesses with an affordable network of talented , motivated, scrappy students from High Schools and Colleges who are eager to take on part-time jobs and gigs. \\n\\nFlipgigs was founded in the Spring of 2011 by Jayati Sengupta. According to Angel Investor Ron Conway, the most thought-provoking sector to develop in 2012 is the proliferation of peer-to-peer markets and the emergence of “collaborative consumption”. The age of so-lo-mo explosion has made it easier to share anything from resources to skills to assets and services.We are seeing a big shift in human relationships in the aftermath of web success in Facebook and LinkedIn era and I think this is just the beginning. A social platform like Flipgigs has the potential to very powerful. While everything else seems to be plummeting in today's tough economic times, one thing that continues to rise is the sticker price of college education. Moreover, with the stock market slump, the vast majority of parents are finding it extremely tough to dip into their dwindling retirement savings . Also, the student loan bubble is another bomb waiting to explode just like the housing mortgage crisis. That is where talent comes in. We already know students are very connected, resourceful and talented. We need a platform like Flipgigs to tap into this talent and have them find gigs easily. Students today need to start to wear a PIY attitude.(pay-it yourself)

\\n== History ==\\n\\nOver the past 20 years, the Dutch Postcode Lottery raised almost 3 billion euros in the Netherlands to support civil society: environmental protection, the conservation of nature, human rights and sustainable development. From the very beginning the lottery supported charitable organisations both international and in the Netherlands by raising money through a lottery and informing the public about the work of the charities concerned. With its 2.5 million participants, the lottery has grown to become the Netherlands’ biggest charity lottery and it supports 75 charitable organisations.\\n\\n== International Scope ==\\n\\nThe Postcode Lottery was also introduced internationally and is now established and successful in Sweden, England and Scotland. The mission of the Postcode Lotteries is to achieve a better world for people and nature; a world in which all people, animals and plants can live healthily, and are treated justly and with respect.\\nThe Postcode Lotteries believe in an entrepreneurial, innovative and creative approach
{{Userspace draft|Aeolian processes on Mars|date=April 2010}}\\nSand dunes have been observed throughout the surface of the planet Mars.  Movement of these dunes has been theorized and inferred from the lack of craters on dunes.  Dune movement has not yet been directly imaged, however.  Understanding sand movement processes is vital to a correct Martian climate model, as well as the safety of future missions to Mars.\\n\\n==Introduction==\\nOn Earth, sand is a very plentiful resource.  Wind, water and ice, as well as chemical reactions and biological activity, all serve to break apart rocks and other solid material into sand on a large scale.  While much of this sand is quickly stabilized by biological and hydrological processes, and converted into sedimentary rock, some of it, especially in desert climates where these influences are minimal, remains in the form of unconsolidated sand and dust for thousands of years or more, subject to influence by the wind.    \\nSand is an especially interesting material to study because of its granular nature.  When acted upon by wind, sand behaves in ways that, at first glance, seem peculiar.  Instead of being deposited evenly along a surface, sand self-accumulates into ripples, drifts, and dunes.  It can be piled high, but can only sustain slopes up to the material's angle of repose for the local gravitational force, beyond which the pile will undergo gravitational collapse.\\n\\nSand dunes cover an estimated 5,000,000 km2 of Earth’s surface (more than half the area of the United States), mostly in desert climes and along shorelines (Hayward et al., 2007).  Where surface sand dominates, it can present a serious hazard to machinery when made airborne.  For example, sand storms famously foiled President Jimmy Carter's attempt to rescue American hostages being held in Iran in 1980.  Granules of sand and dust are so small that they can sneak through microscopic gaps into the workings of complex machinery, causing serious malfunctions and short-circuits.  The abrasive action of airborne sand can damage or destroy structures and equipment alike.  Unchecked, dunes can cover and rend useless vitually anything downwind: roads, machinery, even entire settlements (Hayward et al., 2007; Jones, 2001).\\n\\nIt has been apparent that dunes exist on Mars since 1971, when Mariner 9 imaged the first extraterrestrial dune fields (Iverson, 1976).  Observations of extensive dune fields across the Red Planet in 1972, as well as the absence of any substantial liquid water or geological activity on the present Martian surface, make it clear that aeolian processes are indeed the dominant geomorphic forces which are shaping present-day Mars (Phillips, 1998).\\nThe United States’ “Vision for Space Exploration” includes stipulations for future exploration of Mars by both unmanned probes and crewed missions (Bush, 2004).  With a clear goal of establishing the presence of complicated machinery, where great expenditures and potentially the lives of astronauts will be at stake, it is absolutely essential to understand the mechanics of aeolian processes as they take place on Mars.  An essential part of this understanding would be determining the activity of the current Martian surface.\\n\\nDespite several successful lander and rover missions to Mars in the past few decades, as well as a steady improvement in the resolution of images taken from orbit, there is still no hard evidence of dune movement anywhere on present-day Mars (Williams, 2006).  This study sought to use available imagery from Mars orbiters and Opportunity rover to search for any dune movement.  The analysis concluded that saltation is likely occurring during the most severe storms on present day Mars, and that one saltation event likely occurred as recent as July, 2007.  However, no conclusive evidence for dune movement on present-day Mars was found.\\n\\n==Background==\\n\\n===The nature of sand on Earth===\\nDeserts cover approximately 20% of Earth’s surface, and sand covers 20% of Earth’s deserts (Watson, 1997).  Sand is created by the erosion of rock containing quartz, feldspar, or other hard minerals, as well as the erosion of coral and volcanic glass.  It is mainly found near seashores, where it is created by wave action, along rivers, where rocks frequently collide in strong currents, and in deserts, where it is created by aeolian processes.\\n\\nIt seems natural, when dealing with a problem of sand movement, to first define exactly what sand is.  Sand is a subset of all granular materials.  Granular materials can be as large as boulders, and can be as small as 1 µm (the scale where thermal vibration effects become significant).  Sand can be defined as any granular material which can be influenced by fluid flow, however, this definition must be restricted one degree further by putting a limit on the diameter of the material’s individual grains.  The need for this restriction is clear; while both a fine powder and a heap of boulders fit neatly into the granular material definition, they behave quite unlike traditional sand under a fluid in motion. A powder will be dispersed quite quickly and suspended under the action of a typical wind, while larger rocks will be entirely unaffected, disregarding abrasive erosion.\\n\\nThe definition of sand used by Bagnold is a very good general one for the purpose of dune study (Bagnold, 1941).  A lower limit for sand grain size can be found by investigating the behavior of a fluid flowing over a granular surface.  In natural situations, fluid flow is very rarely fully laminar; it will contain eddies, or “gusts”, which represent a local increase in wind speed and change in direction.  Some of these eddies will be in an upward direction, giving the potential for small particles to be suspended.  However, nearer to the ground, the upward and downward components of the eddies are weaker than other directions. While the intensity of these upward gusts is variable, it is commonly approximated as 20% of the mean wind velocity (Alghamdi and Akyurt, 2001).  Therefore, any particle with a terminal velocity lower than 0.2 times the mean wind velocity will be carried up and suspended indefinitely, provided the wind keeps up. Any particle which can achieve this suspension is defined as dust.\\n\\nAn upper limit for sand grain size is even easier to define.  Sand moves through two modes of transport: saltation and surface creep.  There is an additional mode, reptation, which is the minor saltation of sand grains physically dislodged by impacting particles, which typically do not have the energy to dislodge further grains (Lancaster, 1995; Parteli, 2007).  However, as is apparent by the definition, reptation is merely a subset of saltation, and so shall be included within this category.\\n\\nSaltation is the process where by sand grains actually become airborne, while surface creep is sand movement by which the grains never actually leave the ground.  At some upper limit, however, the combination of wind pressure and sand impact are no longer sufficient to move a grain of sufficient size.  Grains which remain stationary even in the most intense wind are defined as pebbles.  Therefore, any granular material which does not fall under the definition of dust or pebbles is sand.\\n\\nNatural sand never consists of uniformly-sized grains.  There will always be some natural variation in the size of sand grains, even those formed from the same rock and by the same process.  The distribution of sand grain sizes is known as the grading of the sand.\\n\\n===Nature of sand movement===\\nFluid-based sand transport takes place close to the planetary surface, within what is known as the boundary layer; the layer of wind above the ground where surface friction affects the local wind velocity.  Within the boundary layer, wind tends to vary logarithmically by height, defined by Equation 1.  \\n\\n	 	1\\n\\nThe terms used in this equation will be defined later, however there is an important term to point out now: u*, which is known as the shear velocity.  The shear velocity is not an actual velocity, but a mathematical parameter of a wind profile with units of velocity.  The shear velocity is constant for a given wind profile, so it is considered more convenient, in discussions of sand movement and other near-surface processes, to refer to boundary layer winds in terms of shear velocity rather than actual velocity.  \\n\\nA single grain can be moved in a variety of ways.  It can be moved as part of a sand avalanche on a slip face or it can be knocked forward along the ground (or even into the air) by an impacting airborne grain.  When analyzing the initiation of sand movement, however, it is necessary to study the case where a sand grain is moved by the direct pressure of the wind.\\n\\nA sand sheet is obviously stable under a fluid with no velocity.  At very low velocities, friction between individual grains in the sand sheet keeps them from moving.  However, as wind velocity increases, eventually drag and lift forces overcome the forces of friction and gravity keeping the sand grains in place, and the most exposed sand grains will become airborne (Lancaster, 1995).\\n\\nA grain lifted in this manner will likely have a small initial velocity in relation to the mean wind velocity at its initial height.  Therefore, the faster wind will impart some of its momentum upon this grain, possibly reaching an equilibrium, where the grain is moving at the local wind speed.  However, the airborne state of the sand particle is short-lived.  When the particle impacts the sand bed, it transfers its momentum, usually into several sand grains.  In this way, even grains not exposed enough or too large to be moved by the fluid threshold shear velocity may be dislodged and set in motion, which initiates a type of sand movement known as saltation.  Saltation is a mode of sand movement involving short jumps by individual particles, and is the process by which approximately 75% of sand movement occurs (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\nWhen the grain impacts the sand bed, it creates a splash, which is the propulsion of multiple sand grains at the impact site into the wind stream.  If the wind remains constant at or above u*ft, the flux of saltating grains q will initially increase exponentially as more and more grains are impacted and driven into the wind stream.  Since each additional saltating grain draws more momentum from the wind, the wind speed in the saltation layer decreases.  Eventually, the system reaches an equilibrium airborne grain density, where the force of the wind lifts as many grains as it possibly can into saltation.\\n\\nIn addition to increasing the number of grains in saltation, impacting grains also serve to initiate another type of sand movement, known as surface creep.  Even though grains that are a bit too large to saltate by direct wind pressure can be dislodged by impacting grains, other grains are too large to become airborne even when given this extra boost of momentum.  However, if these grains are not too large, they may be knocked forward along the sand surface without ever becoming airborne.  This is the process of surface creep:  descending grains impact other larger grains, moving them forward slightly before friction stops them.\\n\\nOnce saltation has been initiated, the main producer of saltating particles is the impact of other saltating particles on the sand bed.  A peculiar consequence of this property is that after the initiation of saltation, the shear velocity may drop below u*ft, and saltation will still continue.  At this point, the fluid threshold shear velocity becomes unimportant, and a new, lower threshold comes to light.  It is only when the shear velocity drops below this new level, the impact threshold shear velocity (u*t), that saltation will cease.\\n\\nThe aforementioned saturation of the boundary layer is not an instantaneous process.  For any given grain distribution and wind speed, there is a lag between the time saltation is initiated and when the maximum grain density is reached.  The saturation length is the distance a parcel of fluid moves before achieving the maximum grain density (Bagnold, 1941).  It also represents a rough measure of the distance it takes for a change in one property of the wind flow to reform into a new velocity profile according to Equation 1.\\n\\nSand movement, taken on the level of individual grains, is understandably chaotic.  A single wind-blown grain impacting the surface can knock multiple grains into random trajectories.  However, taking the average paths of individual saltating grains gives the characteristic path for a given sand and wind.  The length of this path is the saltation length, Ls, an important parameter in many sand transport models, as well as in the formation of ripples, which will be described later (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\nThe velocity distribution of the wind in the boundary layer is roughly logarithmic by height, as can be seen in Equation 1.  However, the level at which the velocity actually drops to zero is slightly above the actual ground level.  In fact, for different values of shear velocity over the same surface, the wind speed drops to zero at the same height.  This term, z0, is known as the surface roughness, which will be explained later.  It changes greatly between different types of terrain, and is dependant mainly on the degree of sand movement and dominant grain size.\\n\\n==Physics of sand movement==\\nSand, a granular material, has some properties of a fluid, some properties of a solid, and some of neither.  As such, it requires unique equations to describe its behavior, particularly when under the influence of a flowing fluid.\\n\\nSome of the first equations to accurately predict the movement of sand and sand formations were formulated by Ralph A. Bagnold.  His book, Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes, was the first comprehensive study on all forms of sand transport.  It is still used actively many decades later, and may still be the best work on the physics of sand dunes.  Many of his original equations will be useful in this analysis.\\nWithin the planetary boundary layer, mean wind velocity u varies logarithmically with height z according to the relation shown here\\n\\n	 	1\\n\\nwhere κ = 0.40 is the von Kármán constant (AMS, 2000), u* is the wind shear velocity, and z0 is the surface roughness. The terms u∗ and z0 are independent variables which may be determined experimentally.  The von Kármán constant does not depend on atmospheric properties; it is an experimentally derived universal constant.  It should be noted that z0 is not an actual measure of surface roughness, but an apparent measure, which will be explained later.\\n\\nWith the wind velocity distribution known, it is natural to investigate what strength of wind is needed to initiate sand movement.  Individual sand grains are rough, irregular chunks of material, varying widely from the theoretical spherical shape.  Therefore, as Bagnold pointed out, it is convenient to find a scaling factor for determining the diameter of a sphere of equivalent composition as the non-spherical sand grains which will behave identically under the influence of a fluid.  This shape factor is dependant largely upon the amount of weathering that the sand has undergone, as well as the average grading of the sand.  It must often be determined experimentally; for desert sand on Earth, 0.75 is a good approximation. (Bagnold, 1941)  Multiplying the actual average diameter of sand grains by the shape factor yields the apparent grain diameter, which will be used from here on in place of the actual grain diameter.\\n\\nThere are actually two forces imparted upon an exposed sand grain by the wind. (Parteli, 2007)  The first, a drag force, is due to the friction of the moving air on the grain, and is in the direction of the fluid flow.  It is described by the equation\\n\\n	 	2\\n\\nwhere d is the diameter of the particle, σ is its density, β is a constant which depends on the packing of the grains, and u* is the shear velocity.  The second force, the lift force, is\\n\\n	 	3\\n\\nwhere Δp is the difference in pressure from the bottom to the top of the grain.  On the scale of sand grains, due to the strong velocity gradient near the surface, the lift force is very significant.  On Earth, it is approximately equal to 85% of the magnitude of the drag force. \\n\\nAt the initiation of sand movement, the drag and lift forces work to rotate the grain over some pivot point p.  These forces are resisted by the grain’s weight, which is \\n\\n	 	4\\n\\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid and g is the planetary gravitational constant.  Thus, with a momentum balance, it is easily possible to find the threshold parameters for grain movement.  \\n\\nThe forces balance over a pivot point p seen on the right.  Therefore, when (5) is true, \\n\\n	 	5\\n\\nthe saltation process begins (Parteli, 2007).\\n\\nThere are several important parameters which govern sand movement, as well as two important thresholds which indicate when movement will begin.  Under unchanging topographic conditions, the shear velocity is defined by another important quantity, the shear stress, τf according to the relation\\n\\n	           	6\\n\\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid.  The shear stress is merely a measure of the drag force per unit surface area.\\nAs the shear velocity increases, the drag force and lift force increase as well.  The value of u* where the inequality shown in (5) is true is called the fluid threshold shear velocity (u*ft).  An equation for u*ft is \\n\\n	 	7\\n\\nwhere A is the Shields parameter.  The Shields parameter has been determined experimentally in the past, and is relatively constant on Earth.  Under low atmospheric pressure, however, the Shields parameter has a complex dependence upon the grain diameter and wind velocity.\\n\\nAt the fluid threshold, the most exposed sand grains begin to be entrained in the fluid.  Because the velocity of the wind works parallel to the surface, the motion of the grain is temporary; soon, any upward motion of the grain is checked by the grain’s weight, and the grain impacts the sand bed some distance downstream (Bagnold, 1941).\\nAs mentioned above, the additional momentum imparted to grains on impact allows grains of larger sizes to enter saltation.  Thus after the initiation of saltation the impact threshold shear velocity (u*t) becomes the more important parameter.  It is typically near 80% of the value of u*ft (Parteli, 2007).  \\n\\nIf dune movement is indeed occurring, then an important factor to know is the sand flux q, or the weight of sand transported per second.  Here is where Bagnold’s work becomes insufficient, as his sand flux equations are fairly accurate, but do not predict the existence of a threshold velocity.  A universal sand flux equation, which has been confirmed by both wind tunnel and field experiments, here shown as Equation 8 (White, 1979; Lancaster, 1995).\\n\\n	 	8\\n\\nThe problem, then, for determining the existence of dune movement on Mars through calculation, lies in the knowledge of several key features of the local Martian surface.  Indeed, it is very possible that there are places on Mars where saltation still occurs, and others where aeolian features are “petrified”, no longer influenced by the prevailing winds.\\n\\n==Dune formation and movement==\\n\\n===Small-scale sandforms===\\nSand under the influence of wind can be found in many different formations, dependant upon many factors, including grain size, average shear velocity, sand availability, and the presence of obstacles.  Sandform is a generic term for any sandy deposit or formation.\\n\\nThe simplest sandform is one found in the wake of an immobile object, such as an exposed rock, known as a sand shadow (Bagnold, 1941).  Sand shadows are formed by deposition of sand in saltation due to localized reduction of shear velocity in the wind shadow of such an immobile object.  \\n\\nBehind any object within a fluid flow, there is a surface of discontinuity, outside of which the flow is roughly laminar near the mean wind speed, but inside of which is turbulent, with a mean velocity lower than the mean wind speed.  The reason that sand, not dust, is deposited in these areas is a direct consequence of the definition of sand we are using here.  While sand is highly influenced by the wind, it will tend to follow a uniform trajectory rather than a changing streamline in the wind.  So a grain flying over or around an object while in saltation may, by chance, fall into the wind shadow behind the object, where it will likely stay.  A dust grain in suspension, however, will tend to follow the changing streamlines and fly past the wind shadow.\\n\\nIn addition to sand deposits found in the wake, any obstacle will also have a small pile in front of it, due to yet another wind shadow in front.\\n \\nFigure 3: Wind flow around a surface object.  Sand will tend to accumulate in the wind shadow, where the wind is turbulent with a lower average speed\\n\\nA related sand formation is a sand drift, which forms in gaps between objects and in wind shadows caused by changes in terrain.  \\n\\nSand shadows and drifts require the presence of obstacles to alter the boundary layer fluid flow.  However, one of the most interesting properties of sand is that a flat sand sheet is unstable under a fluid flow.  The mechanism for this peculiar property becomes apparent when you analyze the case of saltation over a flat sheet of sand.  \\nTake the simplifying case of a flat sheet of sand undergoing a uniform barrage of saltating grains.  In addition to there being a characteristic path to describe the average path of saltating grains, it turns out that all grains descend at a very uniform angle of descent.  Because of this, the descending grains can be represented by parallel vectors, as in Figure 4.  \\n\\nA “flat” sand sheet can not be perfectly flat, as it consists of finite grains of roughly circular proportions.  As such, at any moment there exists a multitude of minuscule pits and discontinuities.  Figure 4 shows just such a deformation, where a small depression has formed momentarily due to a few saltating grains being removed.  Because of the near-uniform descent angle of grains in saltation, the existence of the depression causes more sand grains to impact in the downwind slope of the crater than the upwind slope.\\n\\nThe sand flux due to surface creep, qc, is proportional to the number of impacts per surface area.  Therefore, the downwind side of the temporary depression is suddenly subjected to a much higher sand flux.  Since there are now more grains moving out of the depression than into it, a continuous saltation will serve to deepen the depression and extend it downwind.\\n\\nWhen the sand surface begins to deviate from the ideal flat sand sheet case, the ideal situation seen in Figure 4 with an even distribution of descending grains at a constant angle no longer applies.  Knowing that saltating grains have a characteristic path, a grain leaving the sand bed at some point will tend to land very near to a point one saltation length downwind.  Therefore, if an area has a much higher sand flux due to increased saltation impacts, the same will apply for an area one saltation length downwind.  In this way, a single chance depression will soon become an extended area of sand ripples.  These sand ripples have a very regular wavelength which is dependent upon the prevailing wind speed, and is remains constant over time as long as the wind speed remains constant.\\n\\nThe shape and height of these ripples depends on the surface sand grading, or the distribution of sand grain size.  This can be deduced by a simple analysis of growing ripples:  as the height of each ripple increases, the average velocity at the grains will increase according to the boundary-layer wind distribution (Equation 1).  If the range of grain sizes in a particular sand bed is small, the higher wind speed at the top of ripples will tend to topple the grains at the crest into the next trough.  Therefore a narrower range of grain sizes will result in smaller ripples.  A wider range of grain sizes will allow for larger ripples.\\n\\nAs seen previously, an area of increased grain impacts will also see an increase in the grains moved by surface creep.  Therefore, if a significant portion of the grains in the sand bed can only move by surface creep, a different kind of sand formation will be seen.  In this case, after the initiation of saltation, the smaller grains are slowly removed until the larger grains begin to dominate.  Ripple-like formations will still emerge, but they will have essential differences.  Larger grains only capable of surface creep will begin collecting at each crest, creating a wind shadow for the subsequent trough similar to that in Figure 4.  Since the larger grains are moved much slower than the smaller grains, and cannot move in their own shadow due to a lack of saltation, the collection at each crest grows larger, as shown in Figure 5.  These features are known as ridges.\\n\\nAt some point, assuming uniform conditions throughout the sand bed, the ridges will grow large enough to shelter the troughs completely, halting saltation, and creating a stable configuration of small, steep-faced ripples.  However, a more common case is one where there is an oncoming saltation from upstream.  In this scenario, the surface creep will continue to build the ridges higher.  With higher ridges, the wind shadows grow longer, and subsequently the wavelength increases.  If saltation conditions prevail for long periods, ridges can grow indefinitely.  So unlike ripples, the wavelength of ridges does not depend on the mean wind velocity.\\n \\nFigure 5:  A typical ridge.  The line AC represents the wind shadow where no saltation or surface creep is taking place, the line DA is the area of maximum surface creep, and the line AB is where creeping grains from the crest are avalanching down the downwind slope.  From Bagnold, 1941.\\n\\nThere is a third feature, known as a megaripple, which can form under the same conditions as normal ripples.  They are widely spaced, less regular in their repetition than normal ripples.  It is unknown whether their wavelengths are dependant upon grain distribution or properties of the local wind regime.  Little is known about their genesis or evolution, and many consider them to be dunes rather than ripples or ridges, but they have been widely observed on the surface of Mars. \\n\\nOne important feature distinguishes ripples and ridges from other sand forms.  In ripples and ridges, the coarsest grains appear at the crests, with finer grains in the troughs.  The opposite is true for so-called large-scale sand formations, the majority of which are true sand dunes.\\n\\n===Dune formation===\\nThe genesis of dunes has actually been observed only rarely in any detail (Lancaster 1995).  Only a few studies have documented properties of dunes from formation until maturity, and these only noted the physical transformation of the dune, not the sand properties believed to be important in dune genesis.  The accepted theory regarding dune formation comes mainly from the study of mature dunes and wind tunnel scenarios, so there is an inherent uncertainty in the exact processes which take place.\\n\\nContrary to popular belief, a sandy desert floor on Earth is rarely composed entirely of sand.  A typical desert floor is either composed of a sandy surface interspersed with pebbles and a few larger boulders, or what is known as a desert pavement, where all surface sand and dust have been removed, leaving a layer of interlocking pebbles.\\nThe desert pavement case is irrelevant for our purposes.  In other areas, large pebbles among smaller sand grains will tend to space themselves out evenly, regardless of their initial distribution.  Because of this, the presence of pebbles tends to stabilize a sand sheet, halting saltation by raising z0, the level at which average wind velocity drops to zero.  However, if a sand sheet stabilized by pebbles is subjected to a stronger wind, more sand may be removed, until another equilibrium level is reached where the sand grains are sheltered by the pebbles.\\n\\nA sandy area with large pebbles can sustain a much higher sand flux than a bare sand sheet.  This is due to the tendency of saltating grains to rebound higher and longer when impacting an immobile object such as a pebble.  So when a patch of bare sand forms by deposition or other processes, the tendency will be for upwind saltation to deposit sand on an existing sand patch.  However, a pebbly surface will have a much higher surface roughness than a surface of bare sand, and so the fluid threshold shear velocity will be much higher as well.  So if the shear velocity is not much higher than u*ft for the pebbly surface (a “gentle” wind), the sand patch will be stretched downwind and dispersed.\\n\\nIn the case of a shear velocity much higher than both fluid thresholds (around 4×u*ft, a “strong” wind), saltation will begin in earnest before the wind reaches the sand patch.  At the upwind edge of the sand patch, saltation increases violently, causing substantial drag which causes a reduction in the wind velocity at and just upwind of the bare sand patch, which in turn results in a net deposition of sand.  In this way, a strong wind will serve to increase the thickness of a sand patch, as well as extend it upwind. The same process has been shown to occur in areas where the surface roughness changes more gradually, due to a change in the sand grading.\\n\\nIn order for dunes to form in these areas of changing surface roughness, four conditions must be satisfied.  First, wind which causes saltation along the smoother sand surface must not blow for too long, lest it dissipate the sand accumulation entirely.  Second, for the duration that the strong wind blows, there must be a consistent supply of sand from upstream, or else the smoother sand patch will quickly dissipate in much the same manner.  Third, there must not be a large amount of grains in surface creep, as these grains will tend to encroach upon the smoother patch of sand, preventing dune growth.  Fourth and lastly, the smoother sand must be at least as long as the saturation length, as there will be varying instances of removal and deposition as the new wind profile adjusts.  This saturation length, usually between 4 and 6 meters on earth, represents a lower limit for the size of true sand dunes.\\n\\nThere are two mechanisms by which upwind saltation could be sustained.  The first case we will consider is a unidirectional wind profile, where both strong and gentle winds blow in the same direction (±15º) (Lancaster, 1995).\\nIn a unidirectional wind regime, any sand patches will have no mechanism by which to become wider, and may only extend in the downwind direction.  This leads to the appearance of sand strips, which are arranged parallel to the prevailing wind.  Unless the wind is much higher than the sand’s threshold shear velocity, these sand strips will soon thin out to the point where buried pebbles start to reemerge, in addition to encroaching grains in surface creep.  However, if a period of strong winds occurs, an interesting self-sustaining wind regime may form close to the surface.  The intense saltation ongoing over the sand strips saturates the boundary layer, slowing the near-surface wind velocity significantly.  \\n\\nThe intervening areas between strips are pebbly, and under a gentle wind the higher surface roughness dictates that the near-surface wind velocity will be lower than over the sand strip.  This situation changes in the above case of a very strong wind.  While there may or may not be saltation over the pebbly surface, the density of saltating grains will be less, assuming the wind is not so strong that this area is saturated as well.  This creates alternating streams of slower and faster wind, which tends to create small eddies and vortices, the sum of which is a convergent wind pattern on the sand strips.  This process can be seen in Figure 7.  If the strong wind can be sustained for a long enough time, these sand strips may eventually build into longitudinal dunes, which are arranged parallel to the wind flow.\\n\\nThe second case, where gentle winds blow in a different direction than the stronger winds, is much simpler.  If an isolated sand patch is created, a strong wind will build it up, at the expense of a now-denuded area just downwind.  If gentle winds occur, just barely above the saltation threshold, from a different direction, they will thin out the accumulated pile slightly, but also replenish the denuded area with a fresh layer of sand.  This regime tends to create oblique dunes or transverse dunes, depending on the magnitude of the direction difference.  Oblique dunes are arranged at an angle to the direction of dune propagation, while transverse dunes are perpendicular to the direction of dune propagation.  Regardless of which case occurs, a continuation of strong winds will build a budding dune steadily up to a certain point.  However, when the dune reaches a size where it begins to alter the nearby wind profile, it no longer needs a strong wind to sustain it.  \\n\\nWhen a dune first forms, a cross-section taken parallel to the dune-building wind typically takes a shape similar to the one shown in Figure 8.  Because of the projection of the dune up into the wind stream, the dune significantly alters the wind profile.  Closer streamlines on the upwind or stoss side of the dune show areas of higher wind velocity, indicative of a net positive sand flux, or sand removal.  On the downwind or lee side of the dune, the streamlines spread apart, showing an area of net negative sand flux, or sand deposition.  In this way, a dune can move essentially unaltered across a desert floor, even if the wind is only strong enough to move the bare sand on the dune.\\n \\nFigure 8:  New dune altering the wind profile above itself.  The streamlines appear closer together on the stoss side of the developing dune, and further apart on the lee side, so sand is removed from the front of the dune and deposited downwind, causing dune movement.\\n\\nA sand dune can not remain in this uniform, hill-like profile for long.  Equation 9 gives the sand flux on a simple hill-shaped dune undergoing no net flux (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\n	 	9\\n\\nwhere x is the horizontal distance from the upwind foot of the dune, c is the velocity of the dune, ρs is the density of the sand in bulk (including air between grains), and α is the inclination of the dune surface at point x.  Therefore, all other factors being equal, the both the net removal and deposition of sand will occur at the point where the slope is the steepest, shown in Figure 8.  With an unequal sand flux, different areas of the dune will begin to advance at different rates, leading to an oversteepening of the lee slope as seen in Figure 9.\\n\\nWhen sand is piled on itself, like any granular material, it can only support itself against the force of gravity to a certain point.  Because of frictional and inter-grain cohesive forces, a sand pile can achieve a fairly large angle, typically around 34º for sand on Earth.  Any slope steeper than this angle will collapse, avalanching until the slope below this critical angle, known as the angle of repose.  In the case of a moving dune, sand avalanching in this manner will eventually morph the lee slope into a fairly straight slope just shallower than the angle of repose.  This straight slope is known as a slip face, and is always roughly transverse to the direction of winds above the saltation threshold.\\n\\nWith the formation of the slip face, the lee of the dune now contains a wind shadow, with a surface of discontinuity roughly equal to the surface of the ideal “sand hill” shown in Figure 8.  The wind shadow will serve to increase deposition even further at the foot of the dune, causing dunes with slip faces to continue to grow.  The dune has now reached maturity, and will continue to evolve and migrate as long as there is a consistent wind above the saltation threshold.  \\n\\n===Dune types===\\nThe exact evolution of the dune beyond its initial formation depends upon two factors:  the amount of sand available for saltation outside of the dune, and the wind regime complexity.  The previous descriptions of dunes as, longitudinal, oblique, or transverse refers only to the arrangement of individual dunes in a group in reference to the prevailing wind regime.  These terms have little or no bearing on the actual dune type.  There are three major types of dunes, each of which represents different local conditions, and, most importantly, all of which are found on Mars (Lancaster, 1995).\\n\\nThe first dune type, arguably the easiest to recognize, is the barchan dune.  Barchans form in areas of limited sand availability and unidirectional wind regimes.  The stoss side of the dune is relatively featureless and dome-shaped.  The slip face is curved, resembling a bite which has been taken out of a dome-shaped dune, terminating with two horns extending downwind, one on each side of the dune.\\n\\nNow, the curved slip face is not an indication of changing wind directions.  It is a consequence of the change in sand-wind interaction as the dune grows.  A larger dune begins to interrupt the linear fluid flow, causing it to curve slightly around both sides of the dune.  Since the local wind speed is the most important factor in determining the slip-face orientation, this slight curvature of the horizontal wind profile causes the slip-face to become curved (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\nFigure 10 shows a very neat example of a Martian barchan dune.  This dune exists near 41.4°S 44.6°E, on the western rim of Hellas Basin, the largest impact crater on Mars, and is part of a chain of barchans not seen to the lower left and upper right.  In this image, by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE imager, all the classic barchan features are visible.  The curved, crescent-shaped slip face is prominently featured in the center, dissipating into two “horns” downwind.  The remainder of the dome-shaped dune is covered in sand ripples, which tend to form on barchans due to their unidirectional wind environment.  The dune-forming wind is from ENE-to-WSW, and the ground outside of the dune is a jumbled bedrock terrain, distributed with small sand deposits, suggesting very limited sand availability.  The dune is about 120 m long from stoss foot to horn tip, with the horn-to-horn distance of about 40 m, fairly typical of large barchans found on Earth.\\n\\nThe barchan is one type of the larger group of crescentic dunes, all of which are formed under unidirectional wind regimes.  Another type of crescentic dunes is very closely related, crescentic ridges (not actual ridges, but a type of dune).  Crescentic ridges resemble parallel chains of barchan dunes which tend to overlap.  Logically, crescentic ridges form in areas where sand availability is higher than with pure barchans, but the wind regime is still unidirectional (Lancaster, 1995).  \\n\\nOn earth, the most common type of dune is the linear dune.  However, on Mars, linear dunes only appear to be dominant in about 5% of large dune fields (Hayward et al., 2007).  Linear dunes appear when there are two dominant sand-moving directions, separated by more than 15º. (Lancaster, 1995)  The slip face is not fixed with respect to a linear dune, but shifts from one side of the crest to the other as the wind regime changes.  A related dune type which has also been found on Mars is the reversing dune, which is formed by a wind regime which periodically changes direction close to 180º.\\n\\nAn even more complicated wind regime, featuring three or more prominent wind directions, results in the formation of star dunes.  These can be the largest dunes, building to several hundred meters high on Earth.  These dunes have multiple slip faces, which are active and inactive depending on the current direction of the wind.  On Mars, they are often found on the floor of smaller craters such as Victoria Crater.\\n\\n==Expected nature of sand-surface interaction on Mars==\\n\\n===Martian weather and climate===\\nMars has long been theorized to have an active atmosphere, possessing many of the familiar transient atmospheric characteristics which we on Earth call “weather”.  As early as 1877, Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli observed what he thought were “clouds” in the Martian sky (Parteli, 2007).  While it is almost certain that what he observed were dust storms which cover the surface of Mars every year or so, it began the race to determine just how “alive” the Martian atmosphere currently is.\\n\\nMariner 9 offered the first up-close look at the planet and its atmosphere in 1971.  Imagery at Mariner 9’s arrival indicated that Mars was in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm, obscuring the surface to the point that the striking polar ice caps were not even visible (Parteli, 2007).\\n\\nAfter a few weeks, the dust storm cleared, allowing for the first clear, high-resolution images of the Martian surface.  These images clearly showed large expanses of dune fields on all corners of the planet.  This spurred theories of an active atmosphere with ongoing sand movement.\\n\\nFive years later, the Viking landers reached the surface of Mars, taking the first direct measurements of wind speed in an extraterrestrial environment.  They measured a mean wind speed which rarely exceeded 10 m/s, which corresponds to a wind shear velocity of approximately 0.8 m/s, assuming several theoretical values are correct (Moore, 1985).  These wind measurements were only taken at one height (1.6 m), so the typical wind profile on Mars could still only be estimated.\\n\\nThere were several significant dust storms during the Viking missions, each of which was associated with a peak in wind speeds to 20 m/s or more.  In at least one case, the wind reached 40-50 m/s (wind shear velocity 3-4 m/s) for a period of around 40 seconds at the Viking 1 lander, causing the first observed saltation event on Mars.\\n\\nThe Pathfinder rover, Sojourner, contained instruments to gather this missing data.  The Pathfinder landing site (19.33 N, 33.55 W) was not far from the Viking 1 site (22.697° N latitude and 48.222° W longitude), and in an area of similar surface composition (Sullivan, 2002).  Sojourner  featured a meteorological boom with three wind socks, which was to help fill in the missing data.  Unfortunately for the meteorological goals of the mission (although probably fortunately for the mission in general), the weather was calm for the entire 83 Martian-day mission, with the wind never climbing above 10 m/s at the 1 meter elevation, and no observed sand or dust movement (Sullivan et al., 2000; Sullivan 2002).  There was enough data to estimate a fluid threshold shear velocity of 4.5 m/s, much higher than the numerically and experimentally predicted value of 2.0-2.5 m/s, likely due to the abundance of boulders and large rocks (Sullivan, 2002).\\n\\nThus it is expected that the average weather on Mars is relatively calm.  However, during dust storms, it appears that winds above the saltation threshold can occur, and have occurred in the past.  These planet-wide dust storms occur almost every year in the Martian northern-hemisphere autumn, and likely happen with such repetition because the atmospheric pressure is highest at that time (Larsen et al., 2002).\\n\\nTemperature at the surface has only a minor influence on saltation, aside from possibly preventing it in the case where water or CO2 frost accumulates.  Temperature has been found to vary widely with season, latitude, and time of day, just as on Earth, but typically is in the range of 180-260 K (-135ºF to 10ºF) in the summer and 160-200 K (-170ºF to -100ºF) in the winter.\\n\\n===Global distribution of sand dunes and sheets on Mars===\\nAlthough aeolian processes are ubiquitous on Mars, large-scale sand sheets/seas, dune fields and ergs are not as extensive on Mars as on Earth.  A recent estimate of the coverage of large-scale sand features (dune fields and sand sheets) on Mars is on the order of 800,000 km2, or about 1% of the Martian surface surveyed in that study (Hayward et al., 2007).  On Earth, large-scale sand features cover approximately 5,000,000 km2, and while this is 1.0% of the Earth’s total surface area, it is 3.4% of Earth’s land area.\\n\\nOn Mars, dunes are found almost exclusively within craters and Valles Marineris, the 4000 km-long canyon system near the planet’s equator.  While on Earth most dunes are linear in nature, on Mars a vast majority of dunes are crescentic, with a smaller amount being linear (Hayward et al., 2007).  Large dune fields feature very few star dunes; however, smaller dune fields in medium-sized craters almost universally have a star-like appearance.\\n\\nAs aeolian processes seem to be the only active geological processes on Mars, aside from impact craters and very localized water action, the lower concentration of dunes compared to Earth suggests that there is less sand available for saltation, either because winds above the saltation threshold are less prevalent or there is less total sand on Mars.  Indeed, it may be a combination of the two.  The main source of erosion which produces sand-sized particles on Earth is oceans and other hydrological processes; these are obviously absent from present-day Mars.  On top of that, evidence for present-day winds above the saltation threshold is very sparse.  Prior to the landing of the Mars Exploration Rovers, there has only been one verified instance of indirectly observed saltation on Mars, during the (Viking 1) Martian Dust Storm of Sol 1742 (Moore, 1985).\\n\\n===Properties of the surface and atmosphere at Meridiani Planum===\\nWhile the initial scope of this study was a planet-wide search for dune movement, eventually the search for directly-observed movement of sand moved to Meridiani Planum, in the area around Victoria Crater, where Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has been aggressively imaging the landscape.  \\n\\nWind data is sparse for the Martian surface.  Only three landers have succeeded in making wind measurements, and only the two Viking landers have a data set more than a few months long.  However, these data sets agreed that the shear velocity rarely exceeds 1.0 m/s, and only dust storms contain winds strong enough to produce saltation. This is much lower than u*ft, which is estimated to be approximately 2.0 m/s at Meridiani Planum (Sullivan et al., 2005).\\nFor the area of Meridiani Planum, as with most of the surface of Mars, the sand is composed of basaltic sandstone.   The grains are approximately 50-150µm in diameter, topped by a scattering of pebbles as large as a few millimeters.  The density of grains has been estimated as approximately 3200 kg/m3 (Sullivan et al., 2005).\\n\\nLike Earth, the wind is rarely dead calm on Mars.  This is apparent from wind speed measurements by both Viking landers and Sojourner rover, which were typically less than 10 m/s (22 mph), but were rarely dead calm.  At Meridiani Planum, prevailing winds during apparently calm weather gradually removed dust from Opportunity’s solar panels over a period of 50 Martian days in the summer of 2006.\\n\\n===Expectations for sand dune movement on Mars===\\nMany studies have attempted to find conclusive evidence of sand movement on Mars.  It is apparent that dunes are either migrating very slowly now, or have migrated in the recent past.  There are two main bodies of evidence which support this:  first, there are very few known impact craters on dunes, and second, most Martian dunes appear crisp, with well-defined slip faces.  Studies have estimated that, if sand movement does occur, it is at a rate of 1-8 cm per year at most (Fenton, 2006).\\n\\nDune fields at Rabe Crater (44 ºS, 35ºE) and Proctor Crater (48ºS, 30ºE) have shown strong evidence for dune movement.  Images of Rabe Crater dunes show alternating dark and light streaks on the dunes’ slip faces which change even over the course of a single Martian year, which have been interpreted as saltation-induced grainflows (Fenton, 2006).  Images of Proctor Crater dunes indicate possible slip face reversing on barchanoid dunes (Fenton et al., 2005).  There is even a suggestion in this study that one slip face moved as much as 37 m, however, no study has yet succeeded in directly imaging a large-scale change in dune positions, which would confirm dune migration.\\n\\n==Observation techniques==\\n\\n===History of early observations of Mars===\\nMars is a prominent visible feature in the night sky.  At its closest approach to Earth, it is the 4th brightest object in the night sky, and one of the only visible objects to be bright red.  As such, it has been observed since man first gazed upward, and was recorded by many ancient civilizations as a star signifying war or death.  Until the 17th century, however, it was merely a mote of red light, varying in brightness over the period of a few years.\\n\\nThe first observations of recognizable features on the planet’s surface are attributable to Christiaan Huygens, who sketched a dark plain now known as Syrtis Major, as well as the bright southern polar ice cap, in 1672.  In the same year, Giovanni Domenico Cassini observed a transit of a small star by Mars, and concluded that it must have a very thick atmosphere; although it turned out that his observations were flawed, this was the first “evidence” of a dynamic Martian atmosphere.  In the early 18th century, Giacomo Filippo Maraldi drew what he thought were clouds stretched across the planet, though these turned out to be permanent features of the planets surface which are still visible today.  He also described changes he observed in the southern ice cap, and suggested that the properties of the surface there changed somehow from year to year (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nIn 1783, William Herschel observed another Martian transit and concluded that Cassini’s observations of a very thick Martian atmosphere were false.  However, he also observed what he called “occasional changes of partial bright belts”, concluding they were storm clouds above the planet.  As the few clouds known to exist on Mars are not visible even today from Earth, Herschel likely was observing local dust storms.  In the 1820s and 1830s, Johann Heinrich Mädler and Wilhelm Beer made many contributions to the study of Mars, conclusively proving that the previously observed dark patches were permanent surface features, and determining the planet’s rotational period to within a few seconds.  In 1837 they observed that Mars was nearly featureless save the ice caps, possibly indicating the first observation of a planet-wide dust storm.  In 1864, Rev. William Rutter Dawes improved greatly upon Mädler and Beer’s observations, making drawings depicting almost every major albedo feature identified today (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nAt this point, there was little more that could be learned from earth-bound telescopes, given the limitations imposed by atmospheric aberrations.  In fact, further refinement of observations, more often than not, were completely wrong.  In the 1870’s, Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli first made the infamous claims of canali, Italian for “canals” or “channels”, on the surface of Mars.  As it turned out, the “channels” were either illusions due to optical effects, or simply imagined features (Sheehan, 1996).  Until the 1960s, the prominent theory was that the dark albedo features on Mars were swaths of vegetation, and the ice caps were seasonal patches of water-ice (Sheehan, 1996).  There were observations of yellow clouds, thought to be dust storms, and white clouds, thought to be analogous to earthbound clouds.  There was even a scientific consensus that many dark features were blue in color (Sagan and Kellogg 1963).\\n\\nHowever, there were some doubters to the scientific consensus.  Some theorized a desert-like planet with large dune fields and no vegetation.  As early as the 1950s the idea of a Martian surface dominated by sand dunes was proposed (Gifford, 1964).  A few scientists also doubted the existence of the canali as anything more than mere optical illusions.\\n\\n===Observations from Martian probes===\\nThose doubters were proven right by the observations of Mariner 4 in 1965.  Sending spacecraft to Mars was no small task—several probes launched by both Russia and the United States failed to reach Mars successfully in early 1963 and mid-1965.  Mariner 4 performed the first successful fly-by of Mars in July, 1965.  It was only able to take 22 discontinuous, low-resolution, blurry images, but they were sufficient to reveal that the traditional view of Mars’s atmosphere was quite wrong.  The images taken by the television camera revealed an old, dry, cratered surface, with no canals, no vegetation, and no evidence of life whatsoever.  Indeed, it looked closer in appearance to the moon than to Earth.  To further disprove the contemporary theories, atmospheric measurements indicated that the surface pressure was at most a few millibars, and was composed almost entirely of carbon dioxide (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nIt was at this time that the idea of dust storms as the main form of weather on the planet first rose to prominence.  It was the only plausible explanation for the seasonal changes in albedo features, with the idea of liquid water and vegetation now all but debunked.  The images were not nearly detailed enough to image sand dunes, however, it was widely believed that the atmospheric dust was lifted by surface sand movement and saltation impacts (Goody, 1969).\\n\\nThe next probes sent to Mars, Mariner 6 and Mariner 7, would add detail to the planets surface (high-resolution imagery of about 10% of the planet’s surface), and confirm the atmospheric measurements made by Mariner 4.  By chance, they photographed no dust storms or dune fields, especially because only a few dozen images from these two probes were of high enough resolution.  However, they did capture images of frost in craters, as well as confirm that the ice caps were likely CO2 ice (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nThe next successful mission, Mariner 9, was also the first successful Mars orbiter.  In fall of 1971, it began returning images of a planet completely devoid of surface features.  After shutting down for a month to conserve power, it began returning images rich in detail, including craters, valleys, and, most importantly, sand dunes.  Mariner 9 was able to image most of the surface down to a resolution of 100 meters or so.  \\n\\nSince then, the resolution of images sent back from Mars has steadily improved.  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Viking orbiters imaged much of the planet down to a resolution of 40-90 meters, with many areas of interest imaged as well as 10-meter resolution.  The next Mars orbiter, the Mars Global Surveyor, arrived almost 20 years later in 1997.  It’s Mars Orbiter Camera imaged about 70% of the planet to better than 7-meter resolution in almost 10 years orbiting Mars.  Finally, the current Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera is imaging areas of interest with a resolution of 25-50 centimeters.\\n\\n11.	References\\n*Alghamdi, A. A. A. and Akyurt, M.

The French Revolution was a true revolution due to the fact that it follows many of the steps necessary to be called a revolution.  One step that should be mentioned is that the public was willing to use violence in order to protect the Third Estate.   This is significant due to the fact that the Third Estate is able to make the changes to the government that people want.  This is shown in the Storming of Bastille where revolutionists broke into the fortress in order to seize gunpowder and weapons.  In Addition, this act convinced King Louis XVI to withdraw his troops from Paris.   Withdrawing his troops showed that he was intimidated by the people, a major step in a revolution.  This also shows the weakness of the French government, which makes the people confident in a revolution.  This step leads to many different steps needed to revolutionize a country. ~tony's

As a physicist and chemical engineer, my scientific loyalties sometimes conflict with my spiritual loyalties.   As a philosopher, seeking eternal, universal truths, my discoveries are being chronicled in a book which I call, True Freedom, which finds much resonance with Ayn Rand's Objectivism and Individualism.\\n\\nTrue Freedom requires individual equality, lest one person or group infringe upon the freedoms of others.  Therefore privacy establishes impartiality and fairness.  Privacy protects individuals from inequality by restricting the ability to discern and thus segregate individuals or groups by any particular characteristic.  Security requires that every person be uniquely, positively, and easily identified so that trust may abound and privacy may be most fully preserved.  True Democracy extends equality by allowing every citizen an equal voice in matters of governance (that there may be no masters or tyrants).
A large proportion of homes include traditional radiators for heating, which over the years, have been mainly left uncovered, but due to growing demand and the awareness caused by exposure on TV shows, radiator cabinets have changed from an upmarket fashion accessory to an essential item in the home. Providing effective protection against coming into contact with hot surfaces is important for all members of the family, especially the young and elderly. Adding covers eliminates the likelihood of this occurring whilst creating attractive room features throughout the home. An ever increasing selection of cabinets in a variety of styles and finishes is available nationwide in standard sizes to cover the majority of UK radiators and adjustable versions are also available. These are designed to fit a number of different sized radiators by adjusting in width to provide a custom made look. With special made to measure services ensuring non-standard radiators can also be covered, homeowners will welcome the safety and aesthetic benefits of adding radiator cabinet.
\\n<big>DATA BSE</big>\\n                       A database is an organized collection of data for one or more purposes, usually in digital form. The data are typically organized to model relevant aspects of reality (for example, the availability of rooms in hotels), in a way that supports processes requiring this information (for example, finding a hotel with vacancies). This definition is very general, and is independent of the technology used.\\nThe term "database" may be narrowed to specify particular aspects of organized collection of data and may refer to the logical database, to physical database as data content incomputer data storage or to many other database sub-definitions.\\nThe term database is correctly applied to the data and their supporting data structures, and not to the database management system (referred to by the acronym DBMS). The database data collection with DBMS is called a database system.\\nThe term database system implies that the data is managed to some level of quality (measured in terms of accuracy, availability, usability, and resilience) and this in turn often implies the use of a general-purpose database management system (DBMS).[1] A general-purpose DBMS is typically a complex software system that meets many usage requirements, and the databases that it maintains are often large and complex. The utilization of databases is now spread to such a wide degree that virtually every technology and product relies on databases and DBMSs for its development and commercialization, or even may have such embedded in it. Also, organizations and companies, from small to large, heavily depend on databases for their operations.
{{failed}}\\n\\nAmong those who have spent significant amounts of time editing on Wikipedia are those who have had the misfortune of dealing with Administrators who have gone far beyond their administrative role of applying Wikipedia policy and respecting consensus, and have granted themselves authority to dictate Wikipedia policy as they see fit, regardless of consensus.

'''<big>BLAST INJURIES</big>'''\\n\\n\\n'''WHY ARE BLAST INJURIES AN IMPORTANT ISSUE RIGHT NOW?'''\\n\\nAmerica's armed forces are sustaining attacks from explosions or blast by rocket-propelled grenades, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and land mines almost daily in deployed settings. Civilian workers and military personnel working in these combat zones are at increased risk of blast-related trauma, particularly blast-related traumatic brain injury (TBI). \\n\\nSome of the TBI and concussive injuries associated with significant blast may not be identified acutely for several reasons. Initially, the blast-related TBI or concussion may have occur simultaneously with other more obvious life threatening injuries. Initially, the focus of medical care providers must be on the most life threatening injuries. Sometimes, in the case of a concussion/mild TBI (mTBI) resulting from blast, there may be no outward sign of injury; service members may also be reluctant to endorse acute symptoms because they do not want to be medically evacuated and separated from their unit. Because blast exposure is so common in the combat zones and almost everyone has had some of the acute symptoms of concussion, it may not be identified as problematic until the service member returns home from the deployment. \\n\\nFinally, concussions and TBI related to significant blast exposure are also likely to have other important co-morbid conditions present. For example, the patient may also have combat stress or depression associated with a return from deployment; it is very challenging for the medical providers in these situations to determine what symptoms are due to the concussion and which symptoms are due to the combat stress or depression. \\n\\n'''HOW DOES BLAST EXPOSURE CAUSE A CONCUSSION OR A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY?'''\\n\\nA TBI is caused by a blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the function of the brain. Exposure to blast events can affect the body in a number of ways; in addition, these different injuries mechanisms can interact and result in more impairments or prolonged periods of recovery.\\nPrimary blast injury is the result of exposure to the over pressurization wave or the complex pressure wave that is generated by the blast itself. This blast over-pressurization wave travels at a high velocity and is affected by the surrounding environment; for example, the effects of the blast wave may be increased in a closed environment such as a vehicle. Air-filled organs such as the ear, lung, and gastrointestinal tract and organs surrounded by fluid-filled cavities such as the brain and spinal cord are especially susceptible to primary blast injury (Elsayed, 1997; Mayorga, 1997). The over pressurization wave dissipates quickly, causing the greatest risk of injury to those closest to the explosion.\\nSecondary blast injury is the result of energized fragments flying through the air; these fragments may cause penetrating brain injury.\\nTertiary blast injury may occur when the individual is thrown from the blast into a solid object such as a adjacent wall or even a steering wheel. These types of injuries are associated with acceleration/ deceleration forces and blunt force trauma to the brain similar to that observed following high speed motor vehicle accidents.\\nFinally, quaternary blast injury can occur in the presence of severe blast related trauma resulting from significant blood loss associated with traumatic amputations or even from inhalation of toxic gases resulting from the explosion.\\nIn summary, TBI resulting from blast exposure can be much more complex compared to TBI from other causes. As such, it is challenging to differentiate blast related TBI and/or concussion from other conditions. Finally, it is also difficult to estimate the course of recovery in these cases, as it may vary widely depending on various types of blast injury and other injury variables, such as the size of the blast, distance from the blast, etc. Because of these issues, it may be difficult to assess blast related TBI and concussion in the same manner that other brain injuries are examined. A better approach may be to conduct an evaluation based on the mechanism (cause) of the injury; that is, screen all individual service members exposed to a blast for any symptoms which might be resulting from the effects of blast on the brain. \\n\\n'''WHAT SYMPTOMS MAY INDICATE A BLAST RELATED BRAIN INJURY?'''\\n\\nDifficulties experienced as a result of a closed brain blast injury may include a range of physical, emotional, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Many of these symptoms are non-specific, however; that is they occur with other conditions such as depression or combat stress. It requires an experience clinician who is familiar with the many variables involved in blast injury and has an understanding of how these variables can affect recovery and ultimately impact return to everyday activities.\\n\\n'''WHAT IS DVBIC DOING TO CARE FOR THOSE WITH BLAST INJURIES?'''\\n\\nDVBIC works to identify all service members who have sustained a closed brain injury during combat operations and to ensure that they receive the best care available. \\n\\nBecause the effects of blast injury on the brain are still being discovered, DVBIC has led the way in developing a number of important research projects examining specific variables involved in the blast. In addition, DVBIC has been involved in studies on developing combat gear which will better protect the brain should a blast occur. \\n\\nFinally, DVBIC has been involved in the validation of several important diagnostic tests for better identifying the blast effects on the brain; these include the use of advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as Diffuse Tensor-weighted Imaging (DTI) and advanced technologies for measuring the function of the brain as the individual works on specific tasks; this technique is known as Magnetoencephalography (MEG).\\n\\n<ref>{{cite web|title=BLAST INJURIES|url=http://www.dvbic.org/TBI---The-Military/Blast-Injuries.aspx|publisher=http://www.dvbic.org|accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref>
'''Non Deliverable Forwards:'''''[[Italic text]]''\\n\\nThe standard FX transaction was designed to facilitate the exchange of notional currencies for the purpose of cross-border commerce.  The standard FX forward transaction allows for parties to the transaction to agree a rate of exchange days, weeks, months or even years in advance of the actual transaction occurring.  The use of these transactions has evolved from its original purpose.  FX transactions are commonly used to hedge exposure to exchange rate risk.  An example of such use would be a manufacturing company making a product in Europe and selling the product in the United States.  Such an organisation would have expenditure (plant, machinery, salary etc.) in Euros and revenue (from the sales of its product) in US Dollars.  If the value of the Euro against the US Dollar increases, the cost base, relative to revenues, would increase, resulting in less profit.  Conversely, the company would become more profitable if the value of the US Dollar increased against the Euro.  To hedge against fluctuations in the exchange rate, the company might enter into a forward FX contract to sell US Dollars against Euros at the end of its fiscal year.  If the value of the Euro increased against the US Dollar, the core business of the company would be less profitable.  However, the value of the FX contract would increase and the profit from this transaction would offset the reduction in profitability.\\n\\nThis hedging strategy works well if currency exchange between the two counties is unrestricted.  However, when exchange controls are in place, the strategy becomes less effective.  This is particularly true in countries where the exchange controls either forbid, or heavily penalise large cross-border cash transfers.  The Non-Deliverable Forward transaction was designed to overcome some of the problems of exchange controls by eliminating the need for cross-border cash transfers without eliminating the risk profile (and hence the hedge effectiveness) of the transaction.
== salt water crockdile ==\\n\\nSaltwater crocodiles are extremely dangerous animals, but data on attacks are limited outside of Australia, and estimates of human fatalities vary wildly between dozens to thousands annually. It is likely that, given this species' low population within most of its non-Australian / New Guinean range, the number of attacks is probably within the lower range of estimates. Most attacks by adult "salties" are fatal, given the animals' size and strength. In Australia, attacks are rare and usually make headlines when they do occur. There are, on average, no more than one or two fatal attacks reported per year in the country.[25] The low level of attacks is most likely due to the extensive effort by local wildlife officials to post crocodile warning signs at nearly every billabong, river, lake and even at some beaches and also due to the relatively well-informed nature of the local citizens. In the Aboriginal community of Arnhem Land, which occupies roughly half of the top end of the Northern Territory, attacks may go unreported and may be more common. There have also been recent, less-publicized attacks in Borneo,[26] Sumatra,[27] eastern India,[28] and in Myanmar.[29]\\nthere are two types of crockadile a fresh one and a salt water one.\\n\\n== chembackolie ==\\n\\nchemabackolie is in ammrica and the wheather is monsoon sun
'''Background'''\\n\\nNowadays, the problems of climate changing and global warming become more and more serious, numbers of countries have implemented carbon taxes or energy taxes that are related to carbon dioxide emission in order to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and thereby reduce the speed of global warming. In Europe, numbers countries, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Italy, Switzerland, and the UK have imposed energy taxes based on carbon content. More surprisingly, in the most powerful manufacturers’ country, China Daily (2010) stated that the Chinese government has proposed to introduce a carbon tax from 2012 or 2013. According to Australian government (2011), Australia is one of the top carbon dioxide emission countries which produce 500million tones of carbon pollution each year. \\nA carbon tax is also called as a price instrument, since it sets a price for carbon dioxide emissions. In economic aspect, the carbon dioxide pollution is considered as negative externality, a negative effect on a party not directly involved in a transaction, which results in a market failure. A tax on a negative externality is called a Pigovian tax which should be equal to marginal damage costs. \\nAustralian carbon tax is a tax on energy sources which charging based on the amount of emission level. It can be implemented by taxing the burning of fossil fuels. The carbon tax involved in producing a product would start to be factored into its final price. Moreover, Australia government plans to use the tax income to investing clean energy. In the future, the carbon tax will simulate the pollution-intensive companies to use other clean production processes in order to reduce their emission and lower their costs.\\n\\n'''Impact on mining'''\\n\\nWhile the Australian Government sees great benefit from the carbon tax, in the mining community, a very different view exists. Unsustainable increases in operating costs could lead to the closure of many mines and thus mass job losses, while businesses which rely on the mining of resources such as airlines could be forced to use cheaper alternatives, thus reducing the required output from these mines. \\nThe introduction of the tax would ‘hinder Australian mining’s ability to operate in the world market’ (Mineral council of Australia 2011). It is estimated that by 2020 the Australian mining industry will have paid between 18 - 25 billion dollars in tax, meaning that Australia’s industry will be at a disadvantage in the world market. This common concern amongst the Australian mining industry is highlighted by the fact that in Europe 73% of all mining exporters are subsidised by the government while only 16% would be in Australia under the carbon tax. The mining industry in Australia already has to compete with mining industries overseas, namely Indonesia, Columbia and China. These countries have significantly cheaper operating costs than Australia ($34 to lift one tone of coal opposed to $42 in Australia), mainly due to the substandard working conditions that exist in these countries. \\n\\nThe Australian Coal Association’s chairman, John Pegler, believes that 17% of all black coal mines in Australia will close putting ‘at risk more than 21000 jobs in the next ten years’ as a consequence of the carbon tax. The ‘economic deadweight cost’ (Marius Kloppers, BHP Billiton’s CEO 2011) will be too large for the smaller mining companies to absorb, forcing the closure of these mines. This ultimately could mean that a monopoly will begin to exist within the mining industry, with larger companies such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto becoming the only mining operators in Australia.\\n\\n'''Political impact'''\\n\\nThe carbon tax has received heavy criticism from opposing parties. One of the major criticisms of the proposed plan is that it will increase inflation. Treasury modelling suggests that household cost will increase by an average of $9.90 per week as a result of the tax. This is because polluters are expected to pass on the cost to consumers. The demand for services such as electricity is said to be relatively inelastic. This means that there aren’t any good substitutes for this service which in turn allows firms to increases prices freely. Therefore, the tax could essentially become politically unsustainable.  Since the tax is linked to the production of goods and services such as electricity, which the consumer cannot live without, there will be constant political pressure on the government to remove the tax. \\n\\nThe labour government is convinced that the carbon tax will work successfully in achieving its aims of lowering greenhouse gases and promoting green energy. The government believes in the concept of climate change, which was a contributing factor towards their decision of developing of this policy. Australian’s are the highest per capita polluters in the developed world, so it does make sense that Australia should join the ranks of other countries such as France and Denmark in introducing a carbon tax. However, the question remains as to weather such a tax will reduce pollution. There are no guarantees that emissions will decline if consumption of the goods and services that produce carbon emissions remains unresponsive to price increases. \\n\\nThe liberal government knows that climate change has not been proven, and that studies are still sketchy. Therefore, their approach has been to adopt the stance of not believing in climate change and going against the carbon tax policy. This could be a clever tactic if the policy is proven to be ineffective after its implementation. \\nThe carbon tax has without a doubt been a huge talking point within Australia and its potential success is crucial to the survival of the labor government.
Sustainable Cleaning\\n\\nIn the 1980’s the United Nations created a commission title the UN Decade for Education for Sustainable Development in response to a growing realization of the need to balance economic and social progress with the concerns for the environment.  The Commission defined sustainable development in the publication as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. \\n\\n\\nPeople and corporations need to be responsible and do the right thing when it comes to protecting our earth.  There are many factors that can help contribute to sustainability, but the one discussed here is chemicals.  Each year, millions of tons of carcinogens are washed down drains.  Harsh chemicals in cleaning products often contain chemicals that have adverse effects on the environment.  In addition to negative effects on the environment, chemical cleaning products also have health effects on those that work with them on a daily basis or are exposed to them in the workplace.  \\n\\n\\n"Green chemicals" started to show up in the marketplace in the late 1980's.  However, during the introduction stages of these types of products, many companies purchased these chemicals at premium prices only to learn that they did not work.  Recently with improvements in technology and a better understanding of customer needs, several companies have began to develop cleaning products that work, are priced right, and are better for the environment and human health.  Today, many businesses are beginning to use sustainable cleaning chemicals to clean their facilities.  Employees, workers, and customers were demanding it.  But, with so many products out there to choose from, how do you know which ones to pick?\\n\\n\\nWhile Green Seal and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Design for the Environment (DfE) program are a good benchmark, they should not be the only consideration if you are selecting green cleaning products.  One item that may be helpful to remember that certifications are based on a process that can take a long time to complete.  Therefore, while these certifications are relevant, they may not be the most up-to-date source of information in "green" chemicals.  Some other helpful tips might include reviewing the ingredients in the product.  Are they made from naturally derived ingredients like sugar, surfactants, citrus, milk and soybeans?  Natural ingredients in products are effective cleaners and are more sustainable for human health and the environment.  Another tip is looking at the company supplying the product.  What is their commitment to Sustainability and how long have they been manufacturing the product?\\n\\n\\nAn innovator in this space is a company called Coastwide Laboratories, a regional distributor located in the Pacific Northwest.  Coastwide began looking into this area in the early 1980's.  Chief Science Officer, Roger McFadden reviewed several products and found various harmful ingredients such as volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde, and carcinogens in the products.  McFadden recognized the danger in these chemicals and developed the Sustainable Cleaning Product Design Standard (SEGC-114) in which all products developed by the manufacturer must comply with.  In addition, the company developed a “green gatekeeper” policy that made sure that cleaning chemicals that they distribute also meet their sustainability requirements.  \\n\\n\\nMcFadden developed the Sustainable Earth® product line is 2003.  This development marks the first time a performance-driven product also complied with SEGC-114, Green Seal, and DfE requirements.  In July 2007, Sustainable Earth® became available to a national audience and made the product available to businesses everywhere in the U.S.\\n\\n[[User:Niccol9132|Niccol9132]] 14:41, 16 July 2007 (UTC)
Introduction\\n\\nDifferential equations arise in many areas of science and technology; whenever a deterministic relationship involving some continuously changing quantities (modeled by functions) and their rates of change (expressed as derivatives) is known or postulated. This is well illustrated by classical mechanics, where the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time varies. Newton's Laws allow one to relate the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body and state this relation as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time. In many cases, this differential equation may be solved, yielding the law of motion.\\n\\nDifferential equations are mathematically studied from several different perspectives, mostly concerned with their solutions, functions that make the equation hold true. Only the simplest differential equations admit solutions given by explicit formulas. Many properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without finding their exact form. If a self-contained formula for the solution is not available, the solution may be numerically approximated using computers. The theory of dynamical systems puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations, while many numerical methods have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy.

== assassin ==\\n\\na murderer, one who kills a person for fanatical,financial or monetary reasons.\\n\\n\\n:history:\\n\\nActive in Persia and Syria from the 8th to 14th centuries, the original Assassins were members of the Nizaris, a Muslim group who opposed the Abbasid caliphate with threats of sudden assassination by their secret agents. Other populations of the area regarded the Nizaris as unorthodox outcasts, and from this attitude came one of the names for the group, ḥaššāšīn, a word originally meaning "hashish users," which had become a general term of abuse. Reliable sources offer no evidence of hashish use by Nizari agents, but sensationalistic stories of murderous, drug-crazed ḥaššāšīn or Assassins were widely repeated in Europe. Marco Polo tells a tale of how young Assassins were given a potion and made to yearn for paradise—their reward for dying in action—by being given a life of pleasure. As the legends spread, the word ḥaššāšīn passed through French or Italian and appeared in English as assassin in the 16th century, already with meanings like "treacherous killer."\\n\\n:modern assassins:\\n\\n\\nIt is clear that assassins have taken a new shape today, using silenced guns, or the cliché knife. But, this idea of assassins derived long before video games and modern depictions. It derived in a time when it was necessary for survival. It was in fact a well-utilized tool to save their country from utter destruction.

Deforestation : Africa’s deforestation rate is twice that of the world’s. 90% of Africa’s population requires wood to use as fuel for heating and cooking. The rate of illegal logging, which is another main cause of deforestation, varies from country to country, such as 50% in Cameroon and 80% in Liberia. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, deforestation is primarily caused by the needs of the poor, along with unsupervised logging and mining.\\nIn Ethiopia, the main cause is the country’s growing population, which induces an increase in agriculture, livestock production, and fuel wood. Low education and little government intervention also contributes to deforestation. Madagascar’s forest loss is partially caused by citizens using slash-and-burn techniques after independence from the French.\\nNigeria has the highest rate of deforestation of primary forests, according to the FAO. Deforestation in Nigeria is caused by logging, subsistence agriculture, and the collection of wood for fuel. \\nAccording to the FAO, deforestation has wiped out nearly 90% of Africa’s forest. West Africa only has 22.8% of its moist forests left, and 81% of Nigeria’s old-growth forests disappeared within 15 years. Deforestation also lowers the chance of rainfall; Ethiopia has experienced famine and droughts because of this. 98% of Ethiopia’s forests have disappeared over the last 50 years.\\nWithin 43 years, Kenya’s forest coverage decreased from about 10% to 1.7%. Deforestation in Madagascar has also led to desertification, soil loss, and water source degradation, resulting in the country’s inability to provide necessary resources for its growing population. In the last five years, Nigeria lost nearly half of its primary forests.

'''Terrorism – A Global Issue'''\\n\\n----\\n\\n\\n\\nTerrorism is one of the most serious challenges the world faces today. It is war against democracy and crime against humanity. It has crossed national boundaries and has international ramifications. It is a new variant of genocide which threatens national unity and sovereignty. Terrorism in one way is a new threat to humanity in the 21st century. Terrorism is violence used by a few against fellow human beings. Terrorist have total disregard for human lives including their own. Violence is an essential part of terrorism. Terrorism is a systematic use of violence or the threat of violence to achieve specific political goals. It attempts to use violence to cause widespread panic, fear or terror to achieve its ultimate political aim. This fusion of crime and politics gives birth to terrorism. Terrorist use violence to demoralize the government and ultimately push them to a situation of counter violence. In this struggle it is the civilian population which suffers the most – physically, mentally and economically. Terrorism which is confined within the national boundary and is directed against one’s own government is called Insurgency.\\n\\nFew words are as politically or emotionally charged as terrorism. One 1988 study by the US Army found that over 100 definitions of the word "terrorism" have been used. Acts of terrorism are not intended to merely victimize or eliminate those who are killed, injured or taken hostage but rather to intimidate and influence the societies to which they belong. Modern terrorism has come to be defined in part by the influential power of the mass media that terrorists co-opt in their efforts to amplify and broadcast feelings of intense fear and anger. As a type of unconventional warfare, terrorism is designed to weaken or supplant existing political landscapes through capitulation or acquiescence as opposed to subversion or action. “Terrorist attacks" are usually characterized as "indiscriminate", "targeting of civilians" or executed "with disregard for human life". The term "terrorism" is often used to assert that the political violence of an enemy is immoral, wanton and unjustified. According to the most common definition of terrorism typically used by states, academics, counter-terrorism experts and non-governmental organizations, "terrorists" are actors who don't belong to any recognized armed forces or who don't adhere to the laws of war and who are, therefore, regarded as "rogue actors". Those who are accused of being "terrorists" rarely identify themselves as such and, instead, typically use terms that refer to their ideological or ethnic struggle, such as: separatist, freedom fighter, liberator, revolutionary, vigilante, militant, paramilitary, guerrilla, rebel, jihadi or mujaheddin, or fedayeen or any one of similar-meaning words in a number of languages. Terrorism has been used by a broad array of organizations to further their objectives. They including right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic and religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments. \\nTerrorism in the past was found in different places. Terrorism [terrorism] the threat or use of violence, often against the civilian population, to achieve political or social ends, to intimidate opponents, or to publicize grievances. The term dates from the Reign of Terror (1793-94) in the French Revolution but has taken on additional meaning in the 20th cent. Terrorism involves activities such as assassinations, bombings, random killings, and hijackings. Used for political, not military, purposes, and most typically by groups too weak to mount open assaults, it is a modern tool of the alienated, and its psychological impact on the public has increased because of extensive coverage by the media. Political terrorism also may be part of a government campaign to eliminate the opposition, as under Hitler, Mussolini , Stalin , and others, or may be part of a revolutionary effort to overthrow a regime. Terrorist attacks also are now a common tactic in guerrilla warfare. Governments find attacks by terrorist groups difficult to prevent; international agreements to tighten\\nIn the past few decades India has been badly affected by terrorist. Some hostile countries encourage fundamentalist forces, separatist tendencies and terrorism in India. As a result, secularism in India, which is built upon the principle of unity in diversity, gets adversely affected. Terrorism poses a direct threat to national sovereignty, territorial integrity and democracy in India. Some well known terrorist in India are People’s war group (PWG), Maoists communists centre (MCC) and the IKF. The world too has seen many terrorist in the past few years. The whole world has been shaken by the destruction caused by these terrorists. The major terrorist associations are Al-Qaeda and Taliban. Al-Qaeda was a association created by the great Taliban leader Osama Bin Ladein who ruthlessly caused the destruction of the World Trade Centre, Washington D.C on 9th September 2001.  He also crashed an airplane on the Pentagon, USA. \\n\\nAl-Qaeda or Al-Qaida is an armed Sunni Islamic organization with the stated objective of eliminating foreign influence in Muslim countries. The most prominent members of the group are adherents of Wahabism, an extreme, militant sect of Islam. While Osama Bin Ladein is generally recognized as the group’s leader, the group’s operations are not centralized, and many independent and collaborative cells exist in multiple countries linked by a common cause.\\nAs a matter of fact, all sectors are put to a stand still due to these terror strikes. The direct effect of these is seen in the sudden drop in the markets. The stock prices do drop down and the trading comes to a stand still, however the business seldom stops and the markets show their cushioning effect by regaining the vigor. But at times the loss of even trading day can be fatal to a country’s economy. Such attacks also incur a direct burden on the defense budget. It goes without saying that the governments do take desperate measures to minimize the losses and cover the country against the future threats. The new areas of defense research open up and thus fresh jobs are created. This brighter side of the attacks is over-shadowed by the loss of lives and panic that is created with in the country. The government, under such circumstances, looses the track of their priorities and the developmental works are sidelined. This causes damage to civic society. The worst hit by terrorist activities is the third world countries. The terrorists make these vulnerable counties their bases and from here carry out the destructive activities. Their influence in such countries shows and threatens the developed world of their power and dominance. Thus such countries make an appropriate guinea pig. If a terrorists strike a big country or a city, the whole world knows about it. The tragedy with these countries is that their miseries are not broadcasted because of their non connectivity with the rest of the world. They are thus the breeding grounds of terrorism and worst hit areas by this destructive activity. \\nFive years after the 9/11, the main security threat faced by nations is not Al-Qaeda. It is the growing ability of small groups to inflict levels of damage unprecedented in history, and the growing inability of nations to check it. Through history, the state has been powerful and individuals weak. But education and technology have now made small groups powerful enough to threaten or decimate the state. This is true of both Islamic and non-Islamic groups. It is Trans-religious.\\nIRA cadres in Ireland and Basque terrorists in Spain and France are Christian terrorists. The Tamil tigers in Sri Lanka are Hindu terrorists who invented suicide bombing. In the 1970s and 1980s, the JVP in Sri Lanka represented Buddhism. The Aum Shinrikyo killed thousands with nerve gas in Tokyo. Maoists in Nepal represent secular terrorism. So do Indian Maoists who operate in 162 out of 602districts. Islamic terrorists have plenty of company. In the US itself, the Unabomber Kaczynski maimed and killed peopled for 18 years before being caught. The Oklahoma bombers killed 168 people in 1995. After 9/11, envelopes with anthrax were sent to the capitol and other places, causing panic in Washington. \\nDeadly explosives like RDX are available globally through sophisticated black markets, sometimes through the internet. So are Assault rifles, grenades and rockets. Cell phones provide communications that only the most sophisticated armies once had. Throw-away cell phones and changing e-mail address provide enough anonymity to foil the most sophisticated, Powerful intelligence agencies.\\nTo change things there should be understanding between people and the willingness to rise against this form of corruptive disaster. Corruption is another cause for all the terrorist activities. The future looks grim. With advancing technology, small groups will become even more powerful, and the state will become even less capable of stopping them. The state will probably respond by acquiring draconian powers and crushing civil liberties.
Sustainability and development\\nProponents of sustainable development have been trying to reconcile the urgent needs of effective environmental protection and conservation of resources with economic development. While the concept has been politically successful at bringing sustainability into the mainstream, both in developed and developing countries, it remains controversial.[29]\\n\\nThe skeptics have pointed out that infinite economic growth is impossible on a finite planet, and that Earth’s limits also define the limits of all material-based activities. Some contend that the term itself is an oxymoron, creating the impression that humans can "have their cake and eat it too."[30] In reality, sustainable development has tended to mean nothing more than ecologically more sensitive growth — a slightly reformed status quo. Rebuttals involve, on one hand, the claims of expanding carrying capacity through human ingenuity, and on the other hand, a different conception of development.[31]\\n\\nSome of the advocates of sustainable development have argued it is best understood as qualitative improvement. In that case, development means “better” rather than “more” and an emphasis on quality of life, rather than material living standards. They call for better, not faster, lives and for a focus on values, not things. These advocates of a new paradigm urge a movement away from the dogma that the only wealth is material wealth, with the resulting development being recognized formally by an improvement in the quality of life indicators.[32]\\n\\nEnvironmental sustainability is the process of making sure current processes of interaction with the environment are pursued with the idea of keeping the environment as pristine as naturally possible.\\n\\nAn "unsustainable situation" occurs when natural capital (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of environmental degradation is the inability to sustain human life. Such degradation on a global scale could imply extinction for humanity.\\n\\nConsumption of renewable resources State of environment Sustainability \\nMore than nature's ability to replenish Environmental degradation Not sustainable \\nEqual to nature's ability to replenish Environmental equilibrium Steady-state economy \\nLess than nature's ability to replenish Environmental renewal Sustainable development \\n\\n\\n[edit] Human impact on the biosphere\\n \\nLand for nature - Catalonia \\nLand for humans - ChicagoThe Millennium Ecosystem Assessment provides the most comprehensive current synthesis of the state of the Earth’s ecosystems. Natural systems (often referred to as ecosystem services) are humanity's life-support system, providing the necessary conditions for humans to flourish. Over the last 50 years the rapidly escalating and potentially critical nature of human global impact on the biodiversity of these ecosystem services has become the source of major biological concern. [33] [26]\\n\\n\\nAt a fundamental level human impact on the Earth is being manifest through changes in the global biogeochemical cycles of chemicals that are critical to life, most notably those of water, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.\\n\\nThere is now clear scientific evidence that human activity is having a significant effect on all of these cycles.[34]\\n\\n\\nGLOBAL GEOCHEMICAL CYCLES CRITICAL FOR LIFE \\nNitrogen Cycle\\n \\nWater Cycle\\n \\nCarbon Cycle\\n \\nOxygen Cycle\\n \\n\\nPhosphorus cycle\\n \\n\\n\\n[edit] Protecting the biosphere\\nThere are two major ways of reducing human impact on the planet. The first is to monitor and respond to direct human impacts on the oceans and freshwater systems, the land and atmosphere (see direct impacts below). This approach is based on information gained from environmental science and conservation biology.[33] However, this is management at the end of a long series of causal factors (known to ecologists as drivers) that are initiated by human consumption, our demand for food, energy, materials and water [35] (see indirect impacts below). It is the assessment of consumer demand for these basic resources that is now a major study area for sustainability science which monitors resource use through the chain of human consumption starting with the effects of lifestyle choices and individual and collective spending patterns, through to the resources used in producing specific goods and services, the demands of economic sectors - and even national economies. This is pre-emptive demand management of causes, rather than a reactive response to the effects of this demand.Sustainability governance can be implemented at all levels of human and biological organization, from local to global.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Direct global environmental impacts\\n\\n[edit] Atmosphere\\nMain topic: climate change\\n\\n \\nUse of the atmosphere \\nTop of the atmosphereThe most obvious human impact on the atmosphere is the air pollution in our cities. The pollutants include toxic chemicals such as nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming the decrease is estimated at about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas: it also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.[36] [37] However, it is now human-induced climate change and the carbon cycle that have become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential for catastrophic effects on both biodiversity and human communities (see Energy below).\\n\\n\\n[edit] Oceans\\n \\nThorsmork, IcelandMain topics: overfishing, ocean acidification, marine pollution.\\n\\n \\nSaltwater fishOceans and their circulation patterns have a critical effect on climate and the food supply for both humans and other organisms. Major environmental impacts occur in the more habitable regions of the oceans – the estuaries, coastline and bays. Because of their vastness oceans act as a dumping ground for human waste. Trends of concern include: ocean warming, reef bleaching and sea level rise, all due to climate change together with the possibility for a sudden alteration of present-day ocean currents which could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe; over-fishing (beyond sustainable levels); and ocean acidification due to dissolved carbon dioxide.[4]\\n\\n\\nRemedial strategies include: more careful waste management, statutory control of overfishing, reduction of fossil fuel emissions, and restoration of coastal and other marine habitat.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Land\\nMain articles: Land use, land-use change and forestry, land cover, urbanization, deforestation.\\n\\nLand use change is fundamental to the operations of the biosphere. This includes alteration to biogeochemical cycles, effects of agriculture, proportions of forest and woodland, grassland and pasture.[4]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Forests\\nMain articles: forestry, deforestation, carbon sequestration, climate change.\\n\\nHistorically about 47% of the world’s forests have been lost to human use. Present-day forests occupy about a quarter of the world’s ice-free land with about half occurring in the tropics [38] In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but deforestation in the tropics is of major concern.\\n\\n \\nBeech Forest - Grib Skov, DenmarkForests can moderate the local climate and the global water cycle through their light reflectance (albedo) and evapotranspiration. They also conserve biodiversity, protect water quality, preserve soil and soil quality, provide fuel and pharmaceuticals, and purify the air. These free ecosystem services have no market value and so forest conservation has little appeal when compared with the economic benefits of logging and clearance which, through soil degradation and organic decomposition returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has estimated that about 90% of the carbon stored in land vegetation is locked up in trees and that they sequester about 50% more carbon than is present in the atmosphere. Changes in land use currently contribute about 20% of total global carbon emissions (in heavily logged Indonesia and Brazil it is the greatest source of emissions).[39] Climate change can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in reafforestation schemes, new plantations, and timber products. Wood biomass is a renewable carbon-neutral fuel.\\n\\n\\nThe FAO has concluded that, over the period 2005–2050, effective use of tree planting could absorb about 10–20% of man-made emissions – so clearly we need to monitor the condition of the world's forests very closely (both reafforestation and deforestation) as they must be part of any coordinated emissions mitigation strategy.[40]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Cultivated land\\nMain articles: agriculture, Green Revolution.\\n\\n \\nRice PaddyFeeding more than six billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth’s resources. This begins with the human appropriation of about 38% [41] of the Earth’s land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity[42]. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness – everything from the initial cultivation need for irrigation water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging, transport (now a major part of global trade) and retail. The benefits of food production are obvious: without food we cannot survive. But the list of costs is a long one: topsoil depletion, erosion and conversion to desert from tillage for monocultures of annual crops; overgrazing; salinization; sodification; waterlogging; high levels of fossil fuel use; reliance on inorganic fertilisers and synthetic organic pesticides; reductions in genetic diversity by the mass use of monocultures; water resource depletion; pollution of waterbodies by run-off and groundwater contamination; social problems including the decline of family farms and weakening of rural communities.[43]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Extinctions\\nMain articles: extinction, International Union for Conservation of Nature.\\n\\n \\nThe Dodo (Raphus cucullatus)In line with human migration and population growth, species extinctions have progressively increased to a rate unprecedented since the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event. Known as the Holocene extinction event this human-induced extinction of species ranks as one of the worlds six mass extinction events. Some scientific estimates indicate that up to half of presently existing species may become extinct by 2100.[44][45]\\n\\n\\nLoss of biodiversity can be attributed largely to the appropriation of land for agroforestry. Current extinction rate are 100 to 1000 times their prehuman levels with more than 10% birds and mammals threatened, about 8% of plants and 5% of fish and more than 20% of freshwater species.[4]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Biological invasions\\n \\nPueraria lobata, Kudzu infesting trees in Atlanta, GeorgiaMain articles: introduced species, invasive species.\\n\\nIncreasingly efficient global transport has facilitated the spread of organisms across the planet. The most stark examples are human diseases like HIV AIDS, mad cow disease and bird flu but invasive plants and animals are now, after climate change and land clearing, the greatest threat to native biodiversity.[46] Non-indigenous organisms often quickly occupy disturbed land but can also devastate natural areas where, in the absence of their natural predators, they are able to thrive.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Freshwater\\nMain articles: freshwater, desalination, limnology, list of countries by freshwater withdrawal, list of countries by total renewable water resources, water resources, water crisis.\\n\\n\\n \\nRiver Fluvia, CataloniaFreshwater habitat is the world’s most vulnerable of the major biological systems due to the human need for potable water for food irrigation, industry and domestic use. Human freshwater withdrawals make up about 10% of global freshwater runoff. [14] and of this 15-35% is considered unsustainable - a proportion that is likely to increase as climate change worsens, populations increase, and water supplies become polluted and unsanitary.[33]\\n\\n\\nIn the industrial world demand management has slowed absolute usage rates but in the developing world water security, and therefore food security, remain among the most important issues to address. Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water.[4]\\n\\n\\n\\n[edit] Indirect global environmental impacts\\nMain article: appropriate technology\\n\\nThe direct impacts on the environment described above are the result of a long chain of causal factors, which is why managing direct human impacts on oceans, atmosphere and land is sometimes called "end of pipe" management; it does not manage the indirect "start of pipe" drivers of this impact which can be reduced to three fundamental factors:\\n\\n \\nPeople - our numbers and consumption patterns (resource use) relate directly to environmental impactspopulation numbers \\nlevels of consumption (affluence) \\nimpact per unit of resource use (which is a result of the technology used) \\nThis has been expressed through an equation: [47]\\n\\nI = PAT\\n\\nwhere: \\nI = environmental impact \\nP = population \\nA = affluence \\nT = technology \\nThis equation has been criticised because: affluence may have positive and negative impact due to the fact that it could either provide the means to tackle environmental problems or promote a higher consumption rate; the equation does not include social considerations such the effect of efficient environmental governance; it is difficult to apply in a realistic and useful way. [48] Nevertheless, it provides a strong starting point for discussion.\\n\\n\\nAddressing sustainability now focuses much of its attention on managing levels of consumption and resource impact by seeking, for example, to modify individual lifestyles, and to apply ideas like ethical consumerism, dematerialisation and decarbonisation, while at the same time exploring more environmentally friendly technology and methods through ecodesign and industrial ecology.\\n\\nAt present individual and household use of resources like energy and water is monitored through domestic water and energy bills and car fuel use – but much greater quantities of these resources are embodied in the goods and services we use. In the same way society as a whole tends to consider environmental management in terms of direct impacts rather than their driver - human consumption. Patterns of consumption must reflect the cleverer use of resources: e.g. using renewable energy rather than fossil fuels and fewer embodied resources in goods and services.[49] [50]
Low-cost terminal\\n\\nThis term is usually applied to a terminal building at an airport, which offers only the most basic features associated with terminals. The advantage of this lies in rapid construction, simplicity in design, and across the range cheaper operating costs. \\n\\nTypical features of a low-cost terminal include:\\n\\n* Simple design \\n* Modularity - all internal functions are designed with future expansion in mind\\n* No air bridges - passengers either walk directly from the building to the departing aircraft, or are bussed to a remote stand\\n* Low development and operating costs - the operator of such a terminal usually aims to attract airlines by offering significantly lower costs to prospective tenants\\n* \\n\\nThese terminals have usually been born out of the demands from [[low-cost carrier]]s, who typically wish to turn around their aircraft in the shortest possible time.remote gates have proven to be the most efficient way of boarding and deplaning passengers.
{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n\\n==Proposed Notability Guidelines for Webcomics and New Media==\\n\\nWikipedia's current [[WP:GNG]]] are designed for a world where print publishing is king -- which is ironic, as the same technology that allows Wikipedia to be edited and accessed around the world also allows for vast amounts of new media, much of which is self-published, to exist and thrive online. Worse, much of the "notable" media available to give these new media entries press is limited, either by choice (e.g. being published by a otherwise notable publisher may require giving up significant intellectual property) or the added difficulty in gaining press in a dwindling collection of acceptable notable media outlets, due both to the closing of multiple long-running media outlets as well as the not-yet-established notability of newer media outlets, such as podcasts.\\n\\nIn short, the current attitude on Wikipedia makes adding articles on these subjects difficult, and leaves articles on these subjects vulnerable to deletion from editors following rigid policies that fail to acknowledge all but the most notable topics, which may frustrate readers interested in those subjects and discourage editors who happen to be experts in these topics if improving the articles becomes secondary to keeping those articles from being deleted.
Okinawa Volunteer Zombie Eradication Team\\n\\nBased out of Okinawa, Japan, the Zombie Eradication Team - Okinawa (ZETO) was establised by concerned deployed personnel.  The island of Okinawa is safe from most plague born infestations due to its location and removal from surrounding mainland.  However, its one strength is also it's demise as an infestation such as a Zombie plague may easily overun the local population if given the opportunity for transmission.  A single asymptomatic infected individual that arrived via boat or airplane could easily spread this infestation.  In almost any out-break scenario, modeling shows that not only would airlines be over-taxed and come to a complete stand still, but most harbours would simultaneously be overrun and eventually congested to the point that they would no longer be viable transportation options due to the large surge in refugees attempting to flee. Having all avenues of egress halted or otherwise inoperable, the remaining population is left to fend for its self against insurmountable odds, waging a fight against an enemy it never believed could exist. Chaos would undoubtedly ensue.\\n\\nIn light of this grim possibility, ZET was established to make the necessary precautionary methods to prevent such an outbreak.  Not only is this team among the few that even consider Zomibes a viable threat to man kind and have thus given thought to planning and considerations necessary for survival during a zombie contigency, they are also armed with skills and a select arsenal tailored towards zombie eradication. ZET is the best and only defense against a possible island-wide Zombie Horde.\\n\\nCurrently run under the control of Agent 666 and Agent 999.  ZET is quickly growing into a strong and effective force.\\n\\nUpdates to come soon.
'''Flood forecasting''' is the process of predicting the occurrence, magnitude, timing, and duration of floods in a specific area, often by analysing various hydrological, meteorological, and environmental factors. The primary goal of flood forecasting is to deliver timely and accurate information to decision-makers, empowering them to take appropriate actions to mitigate the potential consequences of flooding on human lives, property, and the environment. By accounting for the various dimensions of a flood event, such as occurrence, magnitude, duration, and spatial extent, flood forecasting models can offer a more holistic and detailed representation of the impending risks and facilitate more effective response strategies. \\n\\nFlood forecasting is a multifaceted discipline that aims to predict various aspects of flood events, including their occurrence, magnitude, timing, duration, and spatial extent. However, the scope and definition of flood forecasting can differ across scientific publications and methodologies. In some cases, flood forecasting is focused on estimating the moment when a specific threshold in a river system is exceeded, while in other cases, it involves predicting the flood extent and employing hydrodynamic information from models. \\n\\nWhen flood forecasting is limited to estimating the moment a threshold is exceeded, researchers often concentrate on predicting water levels or river discharge in a particular location. This approach provides valuable information about the potential onset of a flood event, enabling decision-makers to initiate preventive measures and minimize potential damages. In this context, flood forecasting models are designed to predict when the water level or discharge will surpass a predefined threshold, usually based on historical data and established risk levels.\\n\\nOn the other hand, more comprehensive flood forecasting methods involve predicting the flood extent by utilizing hydrodynamic information from models. These approaches not only consider the exceedance of a threshold but also aim to estimate the spatial distribution, timing and extent of the flooding. Hydrodynamic models, such as the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) or the MIKE suite of models, simulate water flow and its interaction with the surrounding environment, providing detailed predictions of flood extent, depth, and velocity.\\n\\nIncorporating hydrodynamic information into flood forecasting models allows for a more complete understanding of the potential impacts of flood events, accounting for factors such as the inundation of infrastructure, agricultural lands, and residential areas. By considering the spatial distribution of flooding, these models enable more effective flood management and response strategies, ensuring that resources are allocated appropriately and that vulnerable populations are adequately protected. \\n\\nFlood forecasting can be done using various methodologies, which can be broadly categorized into physically-based models, data-driven models, or a combination of both. The choice of the most suitable approach depends on factors such as data availability, catchment characteristics, and desired prediction accuracy. Here is an overview of each approach:  \\n\\n'''Physically-based models''' simulate the underlying physical processes involved in flood generation and propagation, such as precipitation, infiltration, runoff, and routing. These models are typically more stable and reliable due to their inherent representation of the physics, making them less susceptible to forecast errors in comparison to data-driven models, especially in the absence of inputs like rainfall. However, physically-based models are state-dependent and require accurate initial conditions for optimal performance. During the so-called "warming period" of the model, the performance might be lower due to the reliance on initial conditions. \\n\\n'''Data-driven models''' focus on discovering patterns and relationships within historical data without explicitly representing the physical processes. They can learn complex, non-linear relationships and adapt to changing conditions, making them useful in situations where data is abundant and accurate representation of physical processes is challenging. Examples of data-driven models include regression techniques, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and tree-based algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost. \\n\\n'''Hybrid models''' combine the strengths of physically-based and data-driven models to enhance flood forecasting accuracy and reliability. Hybrid models can utilize the physical understanding from physically-based models while benefiting from the adaptive learning capabilities of data-driven models. An example of a hybrid model is coupling a hydrological model with a machine learning algorithm to improve flood prediction accuracy. Hybrid models may also incorporate physical processes into the structure of the machine learning models.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Nearing |first1=Grey |last2=Cohen |first2=Deborah |last3=Dube

The main cause of the ecological crisis are human induced activities or anthropocentric acts like mining, pollution, deforestations, construction etcetera, for the global economy to grow.\\nThe solutions to the contemporary ecological crisis is sustainable development. Sustainable development is a type of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, not only for anthropocentric reasons but nature holistically. The concept of sustainable will be successful when the current population stabilize for natural resources to be evenly distributed’ for developed countries like the United States not to consume products that they do not need but they can rather make it accessible to countries who need those resources. \\nThe lifestyle as humans that we all should adopt is a culture of living in an environmentally friendly way. Like reusing, afforestation, and adopting traditions that have certain laws to use the environment sufficiently. The ideas of Saint Francis should be implemented because humans tend to have an idea that they are not part of nature or rather superior than nature which is not the case. \\nThe reason why human beings cause environmental degradation is because of the capitalistic regime. Humans in the ancient stages of life lived sustainably were they were part of nature. Nowadays humans maximize the use of natural resources to maximize their profits. That is why nature is exploited, it is a tool to produce and gain a lot of profit which will impact negatively now and in future.\\nHumans now have the obligation to make amends to the natural environment. Already climatic activities have been altered because of the human induced factors now it is up to humans to be part of nature. Humans need to be ethical about the actions that they act on.

Our gender includes a complex mix of beliefs, behaviors, and characteristics. (ADD CIT PP). Basic gender identity is usually formed by age three and is extremely difficult to change after that.[2] All societies have a set of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a social identity in relation to other members of society. Within the last 15 to 20 years, transgender has expanded to become an umbrella term applied to a diverse group of individuals whose gender identity or expression diverges from culturally deﬁned categories of sex and identity. (ADD CIT JOURNAL.) In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to males and females. In all societies, however, some individuals do not identify with the gender that is assigned to their biological sex. Some cultures employ processes of surgical or hormonal sex reassignment to bring people's biological characteristics in line with their gender identity. In other societies, membership of either of the gender categories is open to people regardless of their biological sex. Whether these differences are a product of nature or nurture has been a contentious topic in the social and biological sciences. It is still an open question to what extent genetic versus social factors plays in determining the gender identities of individuals.\\nThe term "gender identity" was originally a medical term used to explain sex reassignment surgery to the public,[3] but is also found in psychology, often as core gender identity.[4] Although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many factors have been suggested as influencing its development. Biological factors that may influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels and gene regulation.[5] Social factors which may influence gender identity include gender messages conveyed by family, mass media, and other institutions.[6] One's gender identity is also influenced by the social learning theory, which assumes that children develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors, and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way.[7] In some cases, a person's gender identity may be inconsistent with their biological sex characteristics, resulting in individuals dressing and/or behaving in a way which is perceived by others as being outside cultural gender norms; these gender expressions may be described as gender variant or transgender.[8]\\nSelf-concept or self-identity has come to mean how a person understands the way others perceive them. Gender identity does not only refer to the placing of a person into the categories male or female, but also includes the concept of interaction with society on a large scale. People who identify as transsexual may strongly desire that other people consider them to belong to a gender opposite of their karyotype; but often are simply trying to modify their bodies and behaviors to match how they feel inside. This may not have anything to do with being either male or female.\\nWith the development of gender identity being influenced by so many factors, there can also be many problems associated with gender identity as well. One of the major disorders is Gender Identity Disorder. Gender Identity Disorder is defined by strong, persistent feelings of identification with the opposite gender and discomfort with one's own assigned sex.[9] The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (302.85) has five criteria that must be met before a diagnosis of gender identity disorder (GID) can be made. "In gender identity disorder, there is discordance between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine."[3]\\nThe term "Gender Identity Disorder" is in and of itself an incredibly divisive issue. Identity conflicts need to continue over time to be a gender identity disorder. How the gender conflict occurs is different in each person. (ADD CIT .GOV). Many people including medical professionals, caregivers, scholars, researchers, students, human rights advocates, and members of the queer community advocate reform of the psychiatric classification of gender diversity as a mental disorder. This classification reinforces false, negative stereotypes of gender variant people and at the same time fails to legitimize the medical necessity of sex reassignment surgeries (SRS) and procedures for transsexual women and men who urgently need them. As a result, a widening segment of gender non-conforming youth and adults who are subject to the diagnosis of psychosexual disorder, are at risk of experiencing social stigma and loss of civil liberty.\\nToday there are many people supporting people with confusion about gender identity. People are fighting for positive movement towards LGBT people. Currently the President Obama is not signing the executive order protecting LGBT workers. This order would prohibit discrimination by federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. It has become a major focus for gay-rights groups. (ADD CIT) This order would protect an over 16 million more workers who are not already covered by existing corporate policies or state laws. They say LGBT workers suffer discrimination at a disproportionately high rate. The protection would add to an existing executive order prohibiting discrimination based on race, religion, sex and national origin.

Before the 20th century a person's sex would be determined entirely by the appearance of the genitalia, but as chromosomes and genes came to be understood, these were then used to help determine sex. Those defined as women, by sex, have genitalia that is considered female as well as two X chromosomes; those viewed as men, by sex, are seen as having male genitalia, one X and one Y chromosome. However, some individuals have a combination of these chromosomes, hormones, and genitalia that do not follow the traditional definitions of "men" and "women". In addition, genitalia vary greatly or individuals may have more than one type of genitalia. Also, other bodily attributes related to a person's sex (body shape, facial hair, high or deep voice, etc.) may or may not coincide with the social category, as woman or man. A survey of the research literature from 1955–2000 suggests that as many as one in every hundred individuals may have some intersex characteristic.[10] It is suggested that the disorder may be caused by genetic (chromosomal) abnormalities, hormone imbalances during fetal and childhood development, defects in normal human bonding and child rearing, or a combination of these factors.(ADD CIT WEB MD) Most people recognize that they have a gender identity problem before they reach adolescence. The disorder occurs more often in males than in females. ADD CIT WEB MD)\\nTranssexual self-identified people sometimes wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their primary sexual characteristics, secondary characteristics, or both. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. Historically, such surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is broadly against genital assignment, shaped to a significant extent by the mature feedback of adults who regret these decisions being made on their behalf at their birth. Gender reassignment surgery elected by adults is also subject to several kinds of debate. One discussion involves the legal sex-gender status of transgender people, for marriage, retirement and insurance purposes, for example. Another involves whether such surgery is ethically sound.[citation needed]\\nThe most easily understood case in which it becomes necessary to distinguish between sex and gender is that in which the external genitalia are removed—when such a thing happens through an accident or through deliberate intent, the libido and the ability to express oneself in sexual activity are changed, but the individual's gender identity may or may not change. One such case is that of David Reimer, reported in As Nature Made Him by John Colapinto. It details the persistence of a male gender identity and the stubborn adherence to a male gender role of a person whose penis had been totally destroyed shortly after birth as the result of a botched male circumcision, and who had subsequently been surgically reassigned by constructing female genitalia.[13] In other cases, a person's gender identity may contrast sharply with that assigned to them according to their genitalia, and/or a person's gendered appearance as a woman or man (or an androgynous person, etc.) in public may not coincide with their physical sex. So the term "gender identity" is broader than the sex of the individual, as determined by examination of the external genitalia, but also includes the sex or gender one identifies with mentally.\\n[edit]\\nHistory\\n[edit]\\nConceptual origins\\nIn 1905, Sigmund Freud presented his theory of psychosexual development in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality. Freud believed gender identity developed during the phallic stage of development. According to Freud, during this stage, young boys develop an Oedipus complex where they have an unconscious sexual desire for their mother and jealousy or hatred for their father. That jealousy turns into emulation as the child seeks to be like their father, eventually identifying with him.[7] In 1913, Carl Jung proposed the Electra complex as an analogous phenomenon in girls. This proposal, however, was rejected by Freud.[14]\\nDuring the 1950s and '60s, psychologists began studying gender development in young children, partially in an effort to understand the origins of homosexuality (which was viewed as a mental disorder at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the UCLA Medical Center for the study of intersexuals and transsexuals. Psychoanalyst Robert Stoller generalized many of the findings of the project in his book Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term gender identity to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in 1963. Behavioral psychologist John Money was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at Johns Hopkins Medical School's Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an interactionist theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book Man and Woman, Boy and Girl (1972) became widely used as a college textbook, although many of Money's ideas have since been challenged.[15]\\n[edit]\\nIn the DSM\\nFurther information: gender identity disorder\\nThe notion of gender identity appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in its third edition, DSM-III (1980), in the form of two psychiatric diagnoses of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and transsexualism (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, the DSM-III-R added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed the GIDC and transsexualism in a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder.[16]\\nThe conceptualization of sex-gender mismatch as a mental disorder is controversial.[16]\\n[edit]\\nInternational Human Rights Law\\nThe Yogyakarta Principles, which is a document on application of international human rights law, provides definition on gender identity. In the preamble, "gender identity" is understood to refer to each person's deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the person's sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other experience of gender, including dress, speech and mannerism. Further, in Principle 3, that each person's self-defined gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and Freedom. These Principles influenced the UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity.\\n[edit]\\nGender identity and sex\\nIn the English language, the terms sex and gender are often used interchangeably in the vernacular. However, in a medical and technically scientific sense, these words are not synonymous. Increasingly, the term gender is being accepted to define psychophysiologic processes involved in identity and social role. It is defined by one's own identification as male, female, or intersex; gender may also be based on legal status, social interactions, public persona, personal experiences, and psychologic setting. Sex, from the Latin word sexus, is defined by the gonads, or potential gonads, either phenotypically or genotypically. It is generally assigned at birth by external genital appearance, due to the common assumption that this represents chromosomal or internal anatomic status. (ADD CIT MEDSCAPE) Therefore gender and sex are different and is not being recognized as such.\\nWhen the gender identity of a person makes them one gender, but their genitals suggest a different sex, they will likely experience what is called gender dysphoria.[17] Some people do not believe that their gender identity corresponds to their biological sex, including transsexual people, transgender people, and many intersexed individuals. Consequently, complications arise when society insists that an individual adopt a manner of social expression (gender role) which is based on sex, that the individual feels is inconsistent with that person's gender identity. Complications can also arise with the stereotyping, or gender typing of behavior for individuals for behavior related to a specific sex, when they identify as a different gender. This dissonance can lead to gender identity disorder.\\nOne reason for such discordances in intersexed people is that some individuals have a chromosomal sex that has not been expressed in the external genitalia because of hormonal or due to other abnormal conditions during critical periods in gestation. Such a person may appear to others to be of one sex, but may recognize himself or herself as belonging to the other sex[citation needed]. The causes of transgenderism are less clear; it has been subject of much speculation, but no psychological theory has ever been proven to apply to even a significant minority of transgender individuals, and theories that assume a sex difference in the brain are relatively new and difficult to prove, because at the moment they require a destructive analysis of inner brain structures, which are quite small.\\nIn recent decades it has become possible to surgically reassign sex. A person who experiences gender dysphoria may then seek these forms of medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity. Alternatively, some people who experience gender dysphoria retain the genitalia that they were born with (see transsexual for some of the possible reasons), but adopt a gender role that is consistent with what they perceive as their gender identity.\\nThere is an emerging vocabulary for those who defy traditional gender identity; see Transgender and Genderqueer.[18]\\n[edit]\\nBiological causes of transsexuality\\nStudies of gonads, genitalia, and hormone levels in gender dysphoric persons have not been able to propose any biological explanations for why some persons experience gender dysphoria. One study of the brains of six transsexual male to female individuals have shown a correlation between the size of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc) and gender dysphoria. The BSTc is normally 2.5 times larger in men than in women, but the average among the male-to-female transsexuals was only 52% of the reference non-transsexual males, which lies within the normal female range.[19] Another study of the same group found that the number of somatostatin neurons in male-to-female transsexuals was also closer to the normal female range than to that of males, and one female-to-male transsexual was shown to have a neuron number within the normal male range.[20]\\n[edit]\\nNature versus nurture\\nAn ongoing debate in psychology is the extent to which gender identity and gender-specific behavior is due to socialization versus in-born factors. The mainstream view is that both factors play a role, but the relative importance of each is contentious.[citation needed]\\nBecause of the pervasiveness of gender roles, it is difficult to design a study which controls for the influence of such socialization. Individuals who are sex reassigned at birth offer an opportunity to see what happens when a child who is genetically one sex is raised as the other. The largest study of such individuals was conducted by Reiner & Gearhart on 14 children born with cloacal exstrophy and reassigned female at birth. Upon follow-up between the ages of 5 to 12, 8 of them identified as boys, and all of the subjects had at least moderately male-typical attitudes and interests.[21]\\nThe roles that are expected of men and women differ from culture to culture, indicating to some that nature may not be the sole determiner of gender identity.[citation needed]\\n[edit]\\nNon-Western gender identities\\nSee also: Third gender and Two-Spirit\\n[edit]\\nFa'afafine\\nIn some Polynesian societies, fa'afafine are considered to be a "third gender" alongside male and female. They are biologically male, but dress and behave in a manner considered typically female. According to Tamasailau Sua'ali'i (see references), fa'afafine in Samoa at least are often physiologically unable to reproduce. Fa'afafine are accepted as a natural gender, and neither looked down upon nor discriminated against.[22] Fa'afafine also reinforce their femininity with the fact that they are only attracted to and receive sexual attention from straight masculine men. They have been and generally still are initially identified in terms of labour preferences, as they perform typically feminine household tasks.[23] The Samoan Prime Minister is patron of the Samoa Fa'afafine Association.[24]\\n[edit]\\nHijra\\nIn the culture of the Indian subcontinent, a hijra is usually considered to be neither a man nor a woman. Most are biologically male or intersex, but some are biologically female. The hijra form a third gender, although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. They can run their own households, and their occupations are singing and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes prostitutes (for men), or long-term sexual partners for men. Hijras can be compared to transvestites or drag queens of contemporary western culture.[25]\\n[edit]\\nXanith\\nThe xanith form an accepted third gender in Oman, a gender-segregated society. The xanith are male homosexual prostitutes whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Xanith can mingle with women, and they often do at weddings or other formal events. Xaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their society, xaniths can marry women, proving their masculinity by consummating the marriage. Should a divorce or death take place, these men can revert to their status as xaniths at the next wedding.[26]\\n[edit]\\nSee also\\n	Gender bias\\n	Gender differences\\n	Sex/gender distinction\\n	Queer theory\\n	Queer studies\\n	Masculinity\\n	Femininity\\n	Intersexuality\\n	Identity (social science)\\n	List of transgender-related topics\\n[edit]\\nReferences\\n	^ Neil R., Carlson, and Donald Heth C..

Waterspouts exist on a microscale, where their environment is less than two kilometers in width. Their bigger cloud that develops them can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus, or as great as a supercell. While some waterspouts are strong (tornadic) like their land-based counterparts, most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics. They normally develop in moisture-laden environments with little vertical wind shear along lines of convergence, such as land breezes, lake effect bands, lines of frictional convergence from nearby landmasses, or surface troughs. Waterspouts normally develop as their parent clouds are in the process of development, and it is theorized that they spin up as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal shear near the surface, and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus or thunderstorm. Weak tornadoes, known as landspouts, have been shown to develop in a similar manner.[2]

Space owned by private organisations such as churches, corporations or charities can offer public access to their space, but with rules that do not apply to state owned public space. graveyards, National Trust coast line and art galleries blur this distinction of not always being state owned, but can be treated in many respects as Public Space.\\n\\nThe time of day can also change the way Public Space may be used.

THE CURRENT STATUS OF ICT IN ETHIOPIA\\n1 Overview An ICT policy should start with an assessment of the country’s current ICT situation. ICT in Ethiopia at present is at the very early stage of development. Nearly the entire rural population lacks telecommunications infrastructure. The vast majority of the population is dependent only on the conventional and traditional information delivery system, the radio or newspapers. Other major indicators pointing to the low level of ICT development in the country are: • Limitations in telecommunications network, which is mainly designed for voice grade communication, and limited numbers of both fixed and mobile telephones. • Lack of skilled human resources coupled with low ICT literacy. • Low level of Internet service and poor connectivity. • Underdeveloped physical and telecommunications infrastructure. • Underdeveloped market for computer hard- and software products aggravated by high cost of acquisition. • Lack of organized data and information resources, and poor accessibility to those that exist. • Limited or no public awareness on the role and potential of ICT. • Undeveloped private sector • Legal and regulatory constraints. \\nNot only is ICT least developed in Ethiopia; it is also highly skewed towards major cities and towns, particularly Addis Ababa. In part, this is due to limitations in both physical and ICT infrastructure, and partly due to the limited number of computers. Consequently, while the Internet and other forms of information and communications technology are readily available in Addis Ababa, limited access to ICT by the rural population continues to be a major impediment to the use of ICT nation-wide. These constraints present the Government with real challenges, but also opportunities, for an accelerated development of ICT in Ethiopia. \\n2 Government Efforts \\nEven though still in its infancy, ICT in Ethiopia has developed rapidly in recent years. In part this is because, in recognition of the vital importance of ICT in the development process, the Government has been undertaking several strategic policy initiatives that promote its development. Initiatives taken by the Government to 8 promote the development of ICT include the relevant components of PSCAP, in particular ICT capacity building, Electronic government (woreda-net) and Electronic education (school-net) programs. The development of ICT in Ethiopia has also been influenced by legal and regulatory measures. These include the 1996 proclamation providing for the introduction of competition and licensing for multiple operators. The private sector has since been active in providing ICT and related goods and services, and several firms provide computer hard- and soft-ware and services at present. Consistent with its policy objectives, the Government has been licensing large numbers of private sector operators to set up cyber-cafes and to engage in sales, installation and service of communications equipment. Although the private sector is expected to take the lead in ICT development, it has so far remained largely undeveloped with operations confined to major urban centers, particularly Addis Ababa, with limited or no activities in the rural areas of the country. Reform of Ethiopia’s telecommunications industry also resulted in the establishment of the Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation, a public telecom operator providing services in fixed, mobile, Internet and data communications. The establishment of the Corporation was followed by the introduction of Internet service in 1997 and mobile telephone service in 1998. The Corporation has been aggressively expanding rural connectivity in tandem with the Government’s decentralization, public and civil reform programs. The Government’s commitment to the development of ICT is also reflected in rising public expenditure in the sector. Public investment in ICT infrastructure and services increased substantially from a paltry US$29 million in 2002 to US$300 million in 2004. Increases in investment have resulted in improvements in ICT infrastructure and services nation-wide both in the public and private sectors. Technologies and services that have particularly experienced expansion include telephone infrastructure and services, mobile/cellular telephone, mobile radio communication, pay-phones, the Internet, Internet cafe services and community centers, which provide a broad range of multi-purpose communication services such as the telephone, fax, computer, e-mail and media services. Even though recent trends in the development of ICT have shown dynamic growth in both infrastructure and services, ICT in Ethiopia still remains the least developed as compared to countries in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere in the world. Proper data communication network is only beginning to make its appearance, the number of computers remains negligible, and the availability of computer hard- and soft-ware products limited. \\nIt is clear, therefore, that much remains to be done, and the Government is determined to step up efforts for the development of ICT in the interests of sustainable growth and poverty reduction, as well as for deepening the process of democratization and good governance. The Government is already taking aggressive measures towards this end and has embarked on programs aimed at improving and expanding physical and ICT infrastructure and services as the backbone for the development of a robust ICT sector in the country.
The Wikimedia Foundation and IBISWorld's Quality Project\\n\\nThe Wikimedia Foundation and IBISWorld share the goals of empowering and engaging people around the world, collecting and developing educational content and to disseminating it effectively and globally. \\n\\nOne of our key goals in this project is to help to continually improve Wikipedia's already high standard of quality, especially in relation to economic, industry and business data, our areas of expertise. \\n\\nPart of this process requires us to upload and update relevant information and facts from our studies on to wiki pages. Like Wikipedia, all our information is completely unbiased. Both our qualitative and quantitative studies are stringently scrutinized and clearly backed by meticulous research and resources. \\n\\nIBISWorld never promotes companies, governments or individuals.

Currently I am making contributions for several reasons: I want to practice my writing skills and request comment and feedback from other contributors as a means of improving my writing. I have read through Wikipedia's guidelines about quality and find it nearly impossible to digest all of it. Instead, small steps with criticism might be more productive. Secondly, I am interested in how the English speaking world has acted, reacted, and interacted with other parts of the world. My recent contributions focus on an Indian guru,  a newspaper editor, British colonial officials, a Togolese writer, and a Dutch-Indonesian writer.  I explore how these interactions shape and re-shape the English language. I see them as contributions to the most studied language in the world. Finally, I need to become more competent with the technical dimensions of writing, such as citing reliable sources, notability criteria, references and so forth. One of the most challenging things about Wikipedia is the opportunity to expand the notability criteria.

DGR believes that industrial civilization is endangering all life on the planet. It advocates for a radical shift in society's structure and function and calls for humans to actively fight for the Earth. DGR's goals are to stop those in power from destroying the planet and to stop industrial civilization altogether. Ultimately, they intend for landbases to be restored and for the human communities that inhabit these areas to be sustainable. DGR has attracted attention because of its controversial nature--it does not condemn violent protest as inappropriate environmental activism.\\n\\nBeliefs\\n\\nThe Deep Green Resistance movement believes that civilization, particularly industrial civilization, is fundamentally unsustainable and must be actively dismantled in order to secure a livable future for all species on the planet.[1] DGR identifies several traits that make industrial civilization a threat to the planet. Civilization relies heavily on machinery, which operates largely on non-renewable and unclean fossil fuels. Civilization has been mechanized beyond the scale at which human communities can operate equitably. Industrial agriculture has caused a dramatic population increase, which DGR cites as the cause of "global ecological devastation". In geological time civilization is a recent phenomenon and DGR argues that its expansion has resulted in the loss of a great deal of traditional knowledge. Cities, which form a basis for civilization, are believed to be unable to sustain themselves by DGR.  \\n\\nDGR's principles stem from the concept of Deep Ecology, which states that all species are inherently equal, and thus that humans are not superior to any other form of life. Deep Ecology attributes the current environmental crisis to the anthropocentrism that is embedded in Western perspectives. The term, first used by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess, was quickly taken up by a variety of radical environmental groups, such as Earth First!. Deep ecology provides a foundation upon which to base the cross-cultural nature-based spirituality that is often associated with radical environmental movements. \\n\\nThe movement differentiates itself from "Bright Green Environmentalism", which is characterized by a focus on personal, technological, or government and corporate solutions,[1] in that it holds these solutions as inadequate. DGR believes that lifestyle changes, such as using travel mugs and reusable bags and taking shorter showers, are too small for the large scale environmental problems the world faces. It also states that the recent surge in environmentalism has become commercial in nature, and thus it in itself has been industrialized. The movement asserts that per capita industrial waste produced is orders of magnitude greater than personal waste produced; therefore, it is industrialism that must be ended, and with that lifestyle changes will follow.\\n\\nTactics\\n\\nThe Deep Green perspective argues that the dominant culture, a term that encompasses all societies that are based on industrialism, will not undergo a voluntary transformation to a sustainable way of living. This includes the dismissal of a possible success of a slow and soft shift to sustainability. Individuals of the Deep Green movement believe that industrial civilization will inevitably collapse. This notion is based on historical evidence of the collapse of major civilizations such as Rome or the Mayan civilization. DGR maintains that humans must be act decisively before the collapse to ensure the Earth that remains is inhabitable for all organisms and that humans build a more sustainably structured society following the collapse. The Deep Green Resistance supports an active resistance movement with the objective of accelerating the collapse of industrial civilization.[1]\\n\\nWithin the Deep Green theory, lifestyle or personal changes are not considered effective methods of creating meaningful change. The mainstream environmental movement is seen as being distracted by its emphasis on individual lifestyle changes and technological solutions instead of confronting systems of power and holding individuals, industries, and institutions accountable. [2][3]\\nThe founders of the Deep Green movement view technological solutions, no matter how well intentioned, as unsatisfactory and warns they could even lead to accelerated ecological destruction and pollution (see Jevons Paradox). The Deep Green movement looks to pre-industrial and pre-civilization, land-based cultures as models for sustainable ways of living.[1]\\n\\nOrigins and Advocates\\n\\nThe term was created for a conference entitled "Deep Green Resistance. Confronting Industrial Culture" in April, 2007 in Deerfield, Massachusetts. Lierre Keith was the main organizer.\\n\\nDeep Green theory draws on elements of anthropology, phenomenology, deep ecology and ecofeminism.\\n\\nDerrick Jensen is a prominent public advocate of Deep Green Resistance. In addition to being a radical activist, he is also a writer, philosopher and teacher. Lierre Keith, another well-known member is a feminist activist, writer and small farmer. Another advocate is activist, writer and organic farmer Aric McBay. Waziyatawin, Stephanie McMillan, and Jack D. Forbes are also prominent members of the movement. DGR draws on the philosophy and writings of many authors, including Richard Manning, Andrea Dworkin, Peggy Reeves Sanday, David Abram, Chellis Glendinning, Chris Hedges, Joseph Tainter, Richard Heinberg, Daniel Quinn, Zoe Blunt and Jerry Mander, among others.[1]\\n\\nLiterature and References\\n\\nA book titled Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet by Aric McBay, Lierre Keith, and Derrick Jensen was released in May 2011, from Seven Stories Press.[4] The book is divided into four sections: Resistance, Organization, Strategy and Tactics, and the Future. Each section contains several essays written by McBay or Keith and concludes with Jensen's answers to common questions about resistance. The book intends to provide a framework from which readers can build upon in order to begin fighting for environmental change.\\n\\nCriticism\\n\\nMajor opposition against Deep Green Resistance is similar to opposition toward anarcho-primitivism and Deep Ecology. Opponents claim that technology and social changes will exist in the future to solve the problems. They also frequently state that advocates of DGR's beliefs are merely misanthropic, destructive nihilists, and that the end of industrial civilization would pose a moral dilemma because of the need for a reduced population (due to the end of industrial agriculture and mass production) and the relinquishment of life-saving technologies.[5][6] Therefore, many argue that DGR does not offer a feasible or desirable alternative human lifestyle. Opponents believe that DGR's goals are unrealistic because they are too extreme to become widely accepted in today's society.[7]\\n\\nDeep Green Resistance is controversial, in a large part, because they do not condemn violent action as a means by which to invoke environmental change. While DGR maintains that it is a strictly aboveground movement and denies having an underground, it does encourage underground action. This is construed as ecoterrorism by critics, and can be a deterrent to environmentalists who believe in nonviolent activism.\\n\\nIt may also be true that, as the environment's degradation[8] increases, DGR's viewpoint may gain more supporters. The Earth First![9] / Edward Abbey[10] perspective around monkey-wrenching[11] and eco-tage[12] were, arguably, a problematic way of addressing problems at that time (for an interesting display of division within the green radical movement on a previous occasion when a perspective similar to that held by DGR was popular, see the book Defending the Earth[13], which recounts debate between Earth First!'s David Foreman[14] and the social ecologist Murray Bookchin[15], centered around statements on the part of Foreman that Bookchin deemed anti-human). Now, it is possible that the ecological inertia[16] and the inertia of the global capitalist-industrial system[17] means that only such methods are meaningful. Many are, and should be, discomfited by such suggestions. However, it is a long time since the Club of Rome[18] report 'Limits to Growth'[19], the Brundtland report[20], and subsequent efforts to engage international governmental and corporate support were instituted (for example the Kyoto[21] and Rio[22] summits under the auspices of the UN), and many would now perceive them as having failed[23] [24] (and, to the extent that they are argued to have been successful, many would argue that there has been a profit-protecting greenwash[25] [26] to hide minimal actual change).\\nDGR is one response to a situation that many perceive as beyond control. Its members have an approach to fighting back, and see themselves as tomorrow's freedom fighters, whilst being fully aware that the underground (perhaps willing to use physical coercion, for example) part of the movement, at least, is currently more likely to be perceived as terrorist in nature, though the overground[27] part of the movement is more subtle, adhering to a code of conduct[28]. In the book, the activities of an underground are signposted more than they are explicated, which is a wise move on the part of its authors. And, in fact, they seek to inform and educate on 'security' and 'warfare' whilst at the same time denying that they represent an 'underground', as this quote from their website illustrates:\\n"It provides an exploration of organizational structures, recruitment, security, and target selection for both aboveground and underground* action. Deep Green Resistance also discusses a culture of resistance and the crucial support role that it can play.\\n"Deep Green Resistance is a plan of action for anyone determined to fight for this planet—and win\\n"*Note: We are strictly an aboveground movement. We will not answer questions regarding anyone’s personal desire to be in or form an underground. We do this for the security of all involved with Deep Green Resistance."[29]\\nFurther critique from this perspective, quite strongly expressed (the article accuses DGR of 'crypto-green-fascism') can be seen on the Libcom website, for example[30].
Sexual identity is associated with sex, gender, and sexual orientation. Sex is biologically and based on ones anatomy. Gender is the intergrated cognitive, social. And emotional schemes assosiciated with being male or female. Sexual orientation refers to ones preference for and attraction to sexually intimate partners. Sexual identity begins with the formation of gender identity in early childhood. (Newman). It involves applying the correct gender label and gender stability and consistancy. Sexual identity is later developed and formed during adolescence. Adolescence is a stage in which great identity (and sexual identity) confusion and exploration occurs. During adolescence we begin to apply and test the gender labels we have provided for ourselves. We do this through intimate and sexual relationships. During this stage, one can change their sexual orientation and identity.\\n\\nSexual orientation refers to ones preference and attraction to sexual partners. The terms used to describe sexual orientation includes, heterosexual (straight), homosexual (gay/lesbian), bisexual (attraction to both sexes), and asexual (no attraction to either sex). Once a person feels confident on their sexual orientation, has gender stability and consistence, that is when their sexual identity is formed.

LGBT individuals are less likely to have strong family support systems in place to have relatives to care for them during aging. They are twice as likely to enter old age living as a single person; and two and a half times more likely to live alone. Because discrimination and harassment still exist, they are less likely to access health care, housing, or social services. When using such services to meet our needs, they often have to cope with others’ homophobia or ignorance.\\n \\nAdditionally, because of legal protections for partnership, most gay and lesbian partners face additional financial difficulties related to tax burdens, health insurance, and inheritance rights, many of which becoming particularly acute later in life. It is still legal to fire gay or lesbian seniors in 34 states because of their sexual orientation. Surviving lesbian and gay partners face different financial difficulties upon the death of their loved one.  They are not eligible for the Social Security survivor benefits as is a heterosexual married partner, heavily taxed on retirement plans—401(k) or IRA—inherited from partners, while married partners inherit these plans tax-free, and charged estate tax on inheritance of home, even if jointly owned, a tax that does not apply to married spouses.\\n\\nDespite advances in the acceptance of lesbians and gay men in many aspects of American life and more individuals living “out,” most retirement communities still do not welcome lesbians and gay men as residents.  Almost no communities address this issue in their policies or practices, and few offer cultural competency training for their staff in working with the LGBT community.  For decades, lesbians and gay men have entered retirement communities only by retreating to “the closet,” pretending to be sisters or cousins, or couples have split up and entered as individuals rather than as partners.  Many others forego the option completely, unwilling to live in a community where they would have to hide their identity and history.\\n\\nCurrent studies document homophobic policies and practices by nursing home administrators, Area Agencies on Aging directors, and health care providers, as well as out-right discrimination and mistreatment by staff in long-term care facilities.  Thus, lesbians, gay men and transgender individuals are five times less likely to seek adequate health care or needed social services out of fear of discovery and ridicule. \\n\\nAs a result, a trend in the active adult and retirement community housing market is the creation of communities specifically for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. \\n\\n'''External Links\\n'''\\n----\\n\\n[http://www.gaylesbianretiring.org Gay and Lesbian Association of Retired Persons]<BR>\\n[http://www.asaging.org/networks/index.cfm?cg=LGAIN Lesbian and Gay Aging Issues Network]<BR>\\n[http://www.flock2it.com Birds of a Feather Resort Communities] - Pecos, New Mexico<BR>\\n[http://www.opencirclecommunities.com Open Circle Communities] - Rehoboth Beach, Delaware<BR>\\n[http://www.palmsofmanasota.com Palms of Manasota] - Palmetto, Florida<BR>\\n[http://www.paradise-one.com Paradise One] - Easthampton, Massachusetts<BR>\\n[http://www.rainbowvisionprop.com Rainbow Vision Properties] - RainbowVision
'''The Environmental impact of Uranium mining in Namibia'''\\n\\n[[Rossing Uranium Mine]] is owned by [[Rio Tinto Group]], the world’s largest mining group, which has annual Profits of over $1.4 billion.  It supplies enriched yellow cake uranium to power stations in France, UK, USA and Japan. The open-cast mine opened in 1976 and it has now been decided that the mine will close with the next few years. The company had an option of spending $100 million and expanding the mine, or closing down all operations by the year 2007; it close the latter. The mine also provides employment for 800 local people. In a country like [[Namibia]] which suffers from a severe lack of water, and has an annual rainfall of less than 30mm, that is a real probe Although mining causes environmental damage, these problems do not necessarily disappear with the closure of the mine. There are many dangerous waste products which would need to be disposed of and many methods that have been used at other mines in the past have been in effectual. Namibia is one of the African countries with a good environment compared to other countries.\\n\\nEvery prospecting and mining operation needs to comply with an environmental management plan (EMP), which is an outgrowth of the assessment of its environmental impacts (EIA). An EIA is mandatory before a prospecting or mining license is granted, and the EMP defines the activities that the operation must undertake to minimize environmental damage. The environmental impact of uranium mining in Namibia has also change the environment as Uranium mining is polluting the environment.  The uranium mining activities are done in the [[Namib-Naukluft National Park]], and this has even worried the Topnaar communities and has expressed their concern over the ongoing prospecting and mining of uranium in all areas that are protected because of their unique flora and fauna.  Mining in protected area is a threat to conservation of the desert and its living organisms.  The government should not give out too many prospecting licences, the Topnaar chief cautioned (New Era Oct. 13, 2008) mining uranium does not only possess health hazards but also environmental concerns such as water contamination, one of the serious issues that have not been addressed properly ( New Era April 21, 2005).\\n\\nAll the Namib uranium mines will bring ore to the surface, crush it, extract the valuable uranium and return the waste to the ground as rock piles or tailings dams or in-filled pits. A common denominator in all these operations is dust. Tons and tons of it – liberated at the surface and exposed to the desert winds. We all know that strong Namib winds pickup and carry dust over hundreds of kilometers, and some of this will blow over towns such as [[Swakopmund]], [[Arandis]] and [[Walvis Bay]]. How significant is this problem? It is difficult to tell, as the uranium mineral car notate can be found naturally on the surface of the gravel plains at Trek kopje, so we should not be surprised to find some of that material in the air.  \\n\\nThe activities that are being done at park is experiencing environmental effects from uranium prospecting and possibly in the future mining and what will happen to the tourism industry in the Namib when mining activities takes place ? Tourists will not want to visit the areas that are near mines or prospecting because of the visual scars on the landscape, noise and dust pollution.  Sensitive desert plants are being destroyed.  The levels of dust, itself being a problem, as well as the radioactive particles that it might carry, will be elevated by all this mining activity. Groundwater contamination Rössing is proud to proclaim that it has adequate measures in place to detect and prevent any spillage or leakage.\\n\\n'''Minimizing the risks'''\\n\\nThese five aspects reflect the biggest changes that could be inflicted upon us. Irrespective of how much you may want to keep Swakopmund or the Namib ‘as you knew it before’, it is going to be changed by uranium mining, so we should get used to the idea and make a positive contribution to the changes. One way could be to motivate for, and get involved in, a strategic planning exercise which spells out the various scenarios and provides options for how to guide or plan those scenarios better. For example, we might consider a zoning exercise in which certain high-value areas (for biodiversity, tourism or wilderness) would be forbidden for mining, as has been done in the Sperrgebiet. Certain areas and routes, already heavily disturbed, could be ear marked as the future desalination foci and the corridors for pipelines power lines that would serve the region at large. Social growth scenarios could be planned, including the growing need for domestic water, waste management and health services. Environmental monitoring stations could be set up to record possible pollutants and health statistics for the region as a whole could provide indicators of the effectiveness of radiation safety precautions.\\n \\n[[Uranium mining]] can be an economically and environmental accepted method for extracting uranium. Environmental impact in uranium mining has also advantages of such as lower capital and operating costs which required much smaller workforce, and the limited environmental impact as no waste lock, no tailing, and lower consumption of water.  One’s long-held impression of mines may be that they profess to bring great economic benefit to a country, yet deep down they are unconcerned with the environmental damage they inflict. Early indications, from the thoroughness of their EIAs, are that they operate on principles of transparency and responsibility to our natural and social environment. The proof of their commitment to make a net positive impact to this country will be seen in how effectively they prevent environmental damage arising from their cumulative activities. \\n\\nUser: Shikomba 21037319 | Shikomba 21037319 ([[User talk: Shikomba #top|talk]] ) 13:25, 16 May 2012 (UTC)\\n\\n== References ==\\n* Environmental Evaluation Associates of Namibia by: John Pallet\\n* Barnard Phoebe (ed) 1998 Biological Diversity of Namibia\\n* Uranium mining in Namibia” The mystery behind low level radiation by: H Shindondola-Mote\\n* Guidebook on Environmental impact Assessment for in Situ leach mining project (IAEA-TECDOC- 1428)\\n* Namibian Newspaper: uranium mining versus tourism, biodervisty by: Ndeshi Shiviya and Michelle Fourier (19 March 2012)\\n\\n\\n[[Wikipedia:School and university projects/Polytechnic of Namibia]]\\n\\n~~Liina K.

\\n\\nUnique characteristics of Rational Behavior Therapy as a psychotherapy in general, and as a cognitive-behavioral therapy in particular:\\n\\n* Based on the [[neurophysiology]] of a healthy [[human brain]] (unlike other therapies based on introspection, observation, or the stoic philosophical influences on [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]]). \\n* It is relatively easy to teach and easy to learn (doesn’t require identification of disorders or knowledge of medical terms). \\n* Clients define what is healthy thinking for them. \\n* Clients are coached to become their own therapists (Rational Behavior Self-Counseling).  \\n* In 1971, RBT psychiatrists pioneered visualization practices and the use of imagery to develop healthy thoughts, emotions and behaviors. \\n* Formulated psychosomatic learning theory and recognizes a specific form of cognitive-emotive dissonance as an inevitable stage in the process of voluntary change. It is an instance when as soon as one starts practicing the new behavior that is in conflict with old habits one begins experiencing a feeling as wrong, weird, or unnatural. That is the stage where people frequently, unfortunately, quit practicing.  \\n* It also accepts the potential health value of religious, spiritual, and deeply-rooted philosophical or existential beliefs, and their beneficial application and integration into a cognitive-behavioral, non-denominational, spiritual or existential counseling.

\\n What is EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY ?\\n\\nEducational technology may be defined as the arrangement of tools in order, that might prove helpful in advancing student learning. It includes systems that are used in the process of developing human capability. Technology can refer to the materials, tools; that humans use. some modern tools include LCD projectors,Laptop and Computers. Technology also means "applied science". In other words, any valid and reliable process or procedure that is derived from basic research using scientific method is considered technology. So,educational technology may be extended to include the techniques of the educators.\\n\\n\\n What are the importance of Educational Technology?\\n\\nEducational technology is very important to the humanities. Today, the instructor doesn't need to be in the same room where the learner is. All they need is an internet connection and they are ready to have a session of teaching. Today, learning becomes more interesting with the use of streaming audio and video or a Powerpoint presentation with voice overs. With the emergence of advanced technology, it is important that educators use these tools to their advantage to not only make teaching easier and more interesting but also to acquire more knowledge to their students.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can get more information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology
Our Children’s Place is a non-profit organization which aims at allowing young children, mostly infants and preschoolers to live with their mothers while the women serve out their sentences for nonviolent offenses. This initiative breaks the cycle of crime, poverty, substance abuse and family violence among generations as well as empowers the child with the help of his/her mother to enhance his/her social, cognitive, physical and emotional development. Ultimately, this project could allow many children to develop better inter-personal skills for their future by interacting with their mothers and will allow them a better chance at a successful future. Our Children’s Place was spear-headed by North Carolina Senator Ellie Kinniard in 2004. They are finally completing construction on a $3.5 million facility that will be able to hold ten women and twenty children, which will open in 2010. These women must be serving a sentence of three years or less and must be convicted of a non-violent crime. The children will receive free childcare, in addition to sessions with therapists and other health professionals. Our Children’s Place also works with H.A.T.S. (Handcrafted And Totally Special), an organization that allows female inmates and community members to create hats and other items.\\n\\n<ref></ref>http://ourchildrensplace.com/
'''OPEN INNOVATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY'''\\n\\n    Open Innovation is a new strategy which many industries, corporate houses and the like are applying in order to commercialize their internal IP (intellectual property) and to obtain a huge plethora of external innovations in order to commercialize them as well. In this approach, firms work and interact with external partners and create newer and better technologies and products and thereby benefitting from this interaction. In other words Open Innovation is also known as Commons based Peer Production. This term was coined by Harvard Law School Professor Yochai Benkler to portray a new model of economic production, in which the resourceful energy of a large number of people is coordinated with the aid of internet into projects without the usual hierarchical organization. Open Innovation actually means connecting external and internal ideas/technologies.\\n\\n    The basic premise of Open Innovation is: Keep your valuable proprietary to yourself and leave everything else to external innovation. Innovation is less about inventing new or building new things and more about coordinating good ideas for commercialization.
:''"EPS systems do not require engine power to operate. Thus, a vehicle equipped with EPS may achieve an estimated improvement in fuel economy of 3% compared to the same vehicle with conventional HPS. As an added benefit, more of the engine's power is transmitted to its intended location — the wheels."''\\n\\nIn EPS systems, the engine has to turn an alternator rather than a hydraulic pump. EPS provides fuel efficiency gains because it is more efficient than hydraulic systems, not because it is using free energy. Generally, hydraulic power steering systems are on all the time (the engine is always running the hydraulic pump) while EPS systems are on demand (only using energy when needed). There may be other efficiency comparisons between EPS and conventional PS, but it is the engine doing the work.\\n\\nI suppose the only time the engine might not be operating the EPS is if the vehicle is a plug-in hybrid, but that accounts for about 0.00001% of the automotive population.

see: www.PedroBOrtiz.com\\n\\nSince June 2010, the world has reached the threshold where more than 50% of its population lives in cities. Growth of many metropolitan urban areas is experiencing an annual growth of 4% to 6%. This means a doubling of population each 15 years. It now takes only 15 years to grow as much as the regions did during the past 400 years. This phenomena is not natural growth nor even rapid growth. It can only be defined as explosive growth.\\n\\nThis phenomenon must be controlled to avoid the metastasis of slums that's currently taking place. If this is not addressed, these metropolises will be unsustainable and will not be incapable of competing in global markets. The World Bank is addressing this critical issue through its Urban Unit of the Sustainable Development Network, supporting the work done throughout the world by the Region Units (LAC, MENA, SSA, ECA, SEA, EPA). \\n\\nPedro Ortiz introduced a metropolitan growth methodology in the 1996 when he developed the Madrid Regional Plan, (the ORT, (Ordenacion Reticular del Territorio). This plan addressed the explosive growth Madrid was experiencing at that time (50% every 20 years). It was successful in controlling and monitoring the the city's growth in a sustainable manner (Spatial and Transport integrated policies). This methodology (Smart Metropolises: MetroCT Method) is now being enhanced and applied to numerous metropolises globally.

VIRUS IDENTIFICATION: A CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIVIRAL THERAPY\\nBiswendu B. Goswami, Ph.D.\\nUnited States Food and Drug Administration (Retired)\\nCurrent Address: 7624 Epsilon Drive, Derwood, MD 20855\\nTel:301-990-6940; \\nAbstract:\\nThe necessity for rapid methods of virus identification arose from the fact that human diseases caused by food-borne viruses range from infectious hepatitis to acute gastroenteritis. The viral causative agents run the gamut from simple single stranded RNA viruses (hepatitis A or infectious hepatitis), to more complex double stranded RNA viruses such as rotavirus and large single stranded RNA viruses such as corona virus. To complicate matters further, each of these virus species have dozens of genotypes ( each genome differing from the prototype by a few to hundreds of nucleotides, depending on the size of the genome. The number of human infections reported each year has made these viruses a major public health problem in the USA in recent years. Food-borne viruses have been associated with high morbidity and some mortality. Currently, other than disinfection guidelines, there are no effective control measures available for public health agencies to intervene in a meaningful way to reduce the incidence of food-borne infections. Viruses can be detected in both stool and vomitus, and the usual route of spread is via person to person. With the availability of more sensitive molecular diagnostics, increasingly outbreaks are reported where the initial source of the infection is contaminated food or water. For FDA (Food and Drug Administration), CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and ORA (Office of Regulatory Affairs), detection of the virus in clinical samples and contaminated food or water is essential to develop meaningful policies for control and prevention.\\nKeywords: Virus Identification; Microarray; Sequence independent target synthesis\\n2\\nIntroduction:\\nProcedures for virus identification is going through a revolution due to two recent developments. The orthodox methods for virus identification by cell culture followed by secondary confirmation by immunological or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques were too slow and labor intensive. PCR based methods have the added disadvantages they are extremely sensitive to impurities in the test material, and have very narrow specificity, requiring individual tests for each virus, and confirmation by sequencing is frequently a necessity to distinguish viral genotypes and sub-genotypes in a species..\\nMicroarray hybridization based techniques for the identification of known mutations in specific areas of viral genomes initially were successfully performed by synthesizing oligodeoxy nucleotide probes based on the sequence of wild-type and mutated viral genomes. The probes (individually synthesized) were then immobilized on solid supports by hand spotting, and later by automated programmable applicators that could handle several hundred probes [1] - [9]. An alternative to the traditional dye termination method of sequencing nucleic acids based on hybridization to oligonucleotide probes on solid support was developed in the 1990s [10]- [13].. However, the true potential for identification of viruses on a massive scale based on sequence of viral genomes did not take off until the development of in situ probe synthesis and immobilization techniques by [11] [14] ;[15]. These newer photolithographic techniques allowed for the synthesis and simultaneous immobilization of hundreds of thousands of probes in a single microarray allowing re-sequencing on a large scale by hybridization to identify virus genotypes. Wong et al., [16]Genome Res. 2007 or 2004?) used such an\\n3\\narray incorporating more than 383,000 probes to sequence the entire 29.7 kb genome of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (coronavirus). Since then, microarrays have been developed that can incorporate over two million probes , This development opened up the possibility of identifying multiple virus species and genotypes in a single experiment. However, to realize this potential, it is necessary to have a target synthesis method that is independent of the sequence of the viruses present in the test material.\\nThe new microarray based method developed in my laboratory at Food and Drug Administration (FDA), avoids PCR amplification with virus specific primers normally used for target synthesis in microarray experiments. However, it must be realized that PCR increases the number of specic targets by millions of folds, that makes very sensitive virus detection possible, As can be imagined, such sensitive detection is not possible without a means of target or signal amplification. This disadvantage in sensitivity is somewhat mitigated by the ability to amplify the signal produced by hybridization using biotin labeling of targets follwed by immunological detection of the biotin by Cy3 labeled streptavidin due to its strong affinity to biotin. A further signal amplification is possible by a second round of reaction with streptavidin foloowed by reaction with Cy3 labeled strptavidin. [17 ]. Detection and identification of any viral sequence is thus possible within this limitations, as,long as it’s sequence is represented in the array [17; 18;19]. Sensitivity may be further improved using modifications such as anti-sense RNA (aRNA) amplification.\\nConsidering the number of viral diseases extant in the world today, only a few of them are controllable by prophylactic use of vaccines. The ease with which viruses\\n4\\ndevelop resistance to vaccines is another major concern. Emergence of resistance viruses is difficult to detect by orthodox methods of cell culture, or even by conventional PCR. As an example , we can cite the experience in many third world countries , which at one time were considered free of poliovirus, but are now experiencing reemergence of this scourge, mainly due to the use of attenuated virus strains for vaccination, which then circulate within the population mainly through fecal contamination [5; 6]. This recirculation allows the virus to undergo multiple rounds of replication raising the possibility of mutations in the genome. A single or a handful of mutations in the genome gives rise to a resistance strain. It is not difficult to imagine a situation when other viruses now effectively controlled by vaccination will develop resistance to existing vaccines. The flu virus is a prime example. New Flu vaccines are needed to be developed almost every year due to development of resistance due to genome mutation [].\\nAn even more dangerous and potentially disastrous trend is developing in the United States where a false correlation between Thermosal , a mercury based preservative used in vaccines and Autism has been widely publicized. As a result, many parents now believe that it is preferable not to vaccinate the children to prevent development of Autism, and leave them exposed to risks of diseases such as polio and mumps. The faulty initial report has since been rescinded, but a potentially very dangerous movement has taken root.\\nFood-borne viruses have been recognized as a major challenge to public health for a number of years. Historically, paralytic poliomyelitis transmitted mainly by unpasteurized milk was an eye opener to public health agencies including FDA to the connection between unsafe foods and human health. The introduction of pasteurization\\n5\\nand subsequently the development of polio vaccines, and a national program for polio vaccination have made polio a thing of the past. Recently however, other food-borne viral illnesses have emerged to threaten the health and safety of a public that have become increasingly complacent due to the increased bacterial surveillance and implementation of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) throughout United States and Europe. Fortunately, it is much easier to detect bacteria in foods. Bacteria grow in simple media, which can then be identified by multiple methods [17, 20]. Despite this, frequent localized epidemics of E.coli and Salmonella from contaminated foods such as meat and vegetables are frequently reported. Virus detection in foods is much more difficult, because unlike bacteria they are obligatory intracellular parasites, and can only be grown with difficulty in cultured animal cell lines [1,2,3,5,7,9,16]. The time factor is of critical importance, and detection can only be achieved by extremely sensitive molecular methods such as PCR. More recently, attempts are being made to use the microarray techniques for virus detection [7; 9 21; 22; 23; 24; 25; 26; 27; 28]. Unfortunately, both types of methods are prone to false negative results, particularly when applied to food matrices. Laboratories are reluctant to invest in equipment and trained personnel because the success rate is so low. The success rate of virus detection is fairly high in body fluids and feces, because these sources have relatively high levels of virus contamination [5; 6; 16; 21; 22; 29; 30; 31. The success rate at FDA and other laboratories in virus detection in foods is very low as noted above, because we had to deal with foods, where contamination levels are naturally low. Moreover, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have the added advantage of hindsight [32]. They test specimens only from patients with overt signs of disease. But once a disease outbreak has occurred in a\\n6\\npopulation, control measures by the CDC are totally inadequate. Vaccines available are effective only prophylactically to prevent further spread of the disease among the non-infected population. Not knowing what food caused the disease outbreak, FDA is unable to advise the population to avoid certain types of food except in very general terms. Recommendations concerning the cleaning of food prior to cooking and consumption, also is hardly effective..\\nMost food-borne viruses have RNA genomes, with minimal viral functions necessary for virus propagation. As a result, development of chemical therapeutic agents has been very slow, with only a handful of agents such as Ribavirin [33] and a few other nucleoside analogs such as Xyloadenosine (XyloA) showing potential to be effective against certain viruses [34; 35; 36]. Interferon induced 2’-5’ linked oligoadenosine (2-5A) and its analogs have not been adequately tested [37; 38; 39]. Additionaly, food-borne RNA viruses are notoriously resistant to inactivation by physical or chemical agents [40; 41 ]. Chief among them in developed countries is norovirus (NV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV).. It is now a recognized fact that NV is the causal agent of most food-borne viral infections in the U.S., while other viruses such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), enteroviruses A and B (HEA and HEB) and rotavirus are also contributors. These illnesses can occur following consumption of contaminated food, person-to-person contact, or food contaminated by infected food handlers, or by contact with water contaminated by treated or untreated sewage [42].\\nA number of factors have compromised FDA’s ability to respond to this new threat by instituting adequate regulatory framework. Projects implemented by FDA have been top-heavy with much more emphasis on sophisticated methods of virus detection, while\\n7\\nthe problem resides in the isolation of low levels of virus from large quantities of suspected foods in a sufficiently pure form to be effectively detected by these ultrasensitive techniques [. We will address this gap in our ability to provide an underpinning of laboratory science by investigating new detection technologies that will allow FDA and other regulatory agencies such as CDC to respond to food-borne virus infections by identifying the viral agent, determining the source, and the relatedness and extent of such outbreaks, when discussing specific results [24;27]\\nMaterials and Methods\\nThe paradigm of virus detection technologies currently available is inadequate in several respects. The technology is mainly based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based amplification of viral nucleic acids. Since most food-borne viruses have an RNA genome, a process called reverse transcription (RT) to first transcribe viral RNA to cDNA is appended to the PCR procedure (called RT-PCR). This technology is two decades old [43] , although the application of this technology for virus detection in foods is more recent [24;27; 28;29;30; 31]. Several important modifications to the basic RT-PCR have been instituted, such as multiplex PCR [30], competitive PCR [32], real time PCR [23] ,which have increased the sensitivity of virus detection and reduced the time needed to obtain results. The major disadvantage of (real-time) RT-PCR for detection of an unknown virus is the specificity of most of these assays. For example, during an outbreak investigation samples will be screened for an etiologic agent that best matches the clinical symptoms when evaluable (norovirus and rotavirus for acute gastroenteritis and HAV for hepatitis) which may delay reporting if an unexpected etiologic agent is causing the outbreak [33]..\\n8\\nTo develop new high density oligonucleotide microarray methods with broad specificity for the sensitive detection and typing of foodborne viruses, these methods will have to be able to i) detect which virus is present, ii) the genogroup and genotype and if needed sub-genotype of the virus. This information could then be used to alert the regulatory agencies on the emergence of new virus strains which is currently not possible without sequencing multiple PCR products. Such detection processes will not be dependent on PCR amplification. Therefore, no prior knowledge of the nature of the virus or its genome sequence will be necessary. The same analyte will be used in a single experiment to obtain all the information needed to identify multiple viruses in the same sample. The high density oligonucleotide microarray based procedure has been used in combination with PCR amplification to study the evolution of the SARS coronavirus ([ 16], and bacterial genomes [20;17] as well as for the detection of mutations in the poliovirus genome ([6] . We have identified different types of HAV and HEA and HEB (more commonly known as coxsackieviruses A and B) viruses as well as studied the evolution of the wild type HAV genome HM175 to a cytopathic variant HM175/18f using a high density (> than 13,000 probes) microarray to detect the nucleotide changes accompanying this phenotypic change [18].\\nAdvances in microarray technology have allowed the identification of genetic variability over very long stretches of DNA in bacterial genomes [17; 20]. These newly developed high density microarrays contain thousands to hundreds of thousands of oligonucleotide probes, instead of a few dozen as used for detection of mutations in poliovirus genome during evolution from a vaccine strain to paralytic poliomyelitis strain [ 6 ; 5] in a single array thereby expanding the power of identification.\\n9\\nIsolation and labeling of Viral RNA. Viral RNA from HAV and CXKV strains were purified from 140 μl of virus cell culture supernatant with a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For norovirus samples, a 10% (wt/vol) stool suspension was prepared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 20 minutes. RNA was extracted from 140 μl to 280 μl of the supernatant with QIAamp viral RNA mini kit. The RNA samples were eluted in 50 μl of elution buffer and stored at -80 ºC until used. Reverse transcription was performed for one cycle (42 °C, 60 min) using random hexamer primers (Invitrogen, CA) followed by 15 min at 70 °C. This is essentially the initial step in current RT-PCR protocols. Reverse transcriptase requires a primer DNA or RNA) with a free 3’OH group hybridized to a template (DNA or RNA) to initiate cDNA synthesis. Viral RNAs that do not have a poly (A) sequence at their 3’end (such as rotavirus genomic RNA) cannot be primed by oligo (dT)15 and are primed by random hexamers. Resulting cDNA was fragmented with DNase I (Invitrogen, CA) at 37 °C for 1 min. Fragmented cDNA was labeled with Terminal Transferase (Invitrogen, CA) in the presence of biotin-11-ddATP (PerkinElmer, MA) at 37 °C for 4 hrs so that the fragmentwd cDNA is extended by a single nucleotide, which does not change its hybridization characteristis to the probes in the array..\\nThe biotin labeled synthesized targets are then hybridized to the probes on the microarray. Following a series of washes, the hybridized targets are reacted with Cy3 labeled streptavidin. After further washes to remove unreacted Cy3 coupled strptavidin, hybridized targets are detected by Cy3 fluorescence by scanning the array.\\n10\\nA typical result is shown in Fig.1... Computer analysis of the signal by software developed for this purpose is used to identify the virus species, genogroup and the strain within the genogroup.\\nMicroarray Hybridization, Scanning, and Data Analysis. Microarray hybridization was performed using the Affymetrix protocol. Briefly, Biotinylated cDNA in the presence of Affymetrix hybridization buffer was hybridized to the microarray chip in a total volume of 120 μl. Before application to the array, the samples were heated to 98 °C for 1 min, cooled at 45 °C for another 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 5 min. The microarray chip was then incubated at 45 °C for 16 hrs in a hybridization oven. Following hybridization, the wash and stain procedures were carried out by the Fluidics station (Affymetrix, CA). All arrays were imaged by using Affymetrix microarray scanner at a resolution of 10 μm per pixel. Signal intensity of the hybridization was extracted by using Affymetrix power tools, and the subsequent data analysis was performed using MS Excel. For each viral genome represented on the array, the average signal intensity for all the probes within that genome was determined. The average intensity is first determined as described by Jackson et al. (16), and Ayodeji et al. (17). Each average genome intensity was then normalized by the average intensity of all the probes represented on the array. To minimize effects of nonspecific hybridization, an empirical cutoff value of 3 was considered as a threshold value for a positive signal. Microarray hybridization data were then converted to color visualization schemes in which hybridization signal intensity is reflected by the color scale of vertical strips.\\nMicroarray design:\\n11\\nAll microarrays used in this study were customer ordered to be fabricated by Affymetrix Inc. (Santa Clara, CA) using a maskless array synthesis technology (Singh-Gasson et al., 1999; Nuwaysir et al., 2002. The tiling microarray contained 25-mer oligonucleotide probes which were designed to detect common food-borne viruses including hepatitis A virus, norovirus, coxsackievirus, rotavirus, hepatitis E virus, and astrovirus as well as saporovirus. All viral genetic sequence data were obtained from database of viral genomes from Genbank. The chips were composed of overlapping 25-mer oligonucleotides which covered 3,000 bp sequences from 5’ end viral genomes of each virus. Each sequence of interest was tiled with the 25-mer probes with 2-bp spacing. The microarray representation of common foodborne viruses are listed in Tables. 1 to 6 along with specific hybridization signal intensities that reflect relatedness of virus strains within the same species..\\nThe design of the microarray follows closely the protocol we have recently described ([39]Ayodeji et al. 2009; Chen at al. [41}). However, instead of 13,000 probes, these arrays each contain 100,000 probes covering every complete and partial sequences available in the database for NoV, HAV, HEA, HEB and RV. We also developed probes covering the entire sequence of several individual viral genome sequences. . Probes are designed to have a 2 base overlap i.e., each probe starts at the 2nd nucleotide of every sequence, thereby covering a 7.5kb genome with about 1500 probes. 7.5 kb is the average size of the RNA genome of a common food-borne virus except rotavirus that has a segmented double stranded RNA genome, where each segment RNA is 1.5 to 2kbp long. Alternatively, the 5 base overlap between consecutive probes may be reduced to increase the number of probes to cover the same sequence Since the capacity of the\\n12\\nmicroarrays (up to 2 million probes) far exceeds the number of probes in our current array design (100,000), we could incorporate probes covering more viruses, although not all virus groups were tested for this study. However, these served the purpose of negative controls to show that false positives were not seen. For target synthesis for these experiments, we have investigated whether viral targets can be obtained in sufficient quantities in a sequence non-specific manner to hybridize to a high density microarray containing greater than 100,000 probes representing all the known sequences (partial or complete) of the major foodborne viruses (NV, HAV, HEA, HEB and rotaviruses) and identify the viral strain (or strains) present in a sample.\\nRESULTS\\nTables1to 6 show the lists the selected enteric viruses and the number of probes for each strain of virus that were synthesized directly on the FDA_EVIR microarray by photolithography whereby the total number of probes on the array is 91542. Selected regions of several enteric viruses’ genomes were tiled at two nucleotide spacing. Each probe is 25 nucleotides long and there is a 23 base-pair overlap between consecutive probes for the same virus genotype; therefore, the complete array covers 183,084 nucleotides of viral genomic sequence. The probe numbers we used for each strain of HAV for the sequence coverage of several HAV strains belonging to HAV genogroups I to III are shown in Table 1.. But no attempt was made to include all the partial sequences that exist in the database., although we included some of the VP1-2 and VP3 regions, that are reported to contain maximum sequence conservation.\\n13\\nTable 1.

Although various degree of cross-hybridization to genotype IA oligoprobes was also observed, the strongest signal was identified in genotype IB oligoprobes. Genotype IB oligoprobes yielded at least seven times above the local background, ranging from 29 to 7.7 times.

Although cross-hybridization within different genotype strains in HAV genus occurred, this was expected due to less divergence among genotypes of HAV. Stronger hybridization signal was obtained between specific genotype viral RNA and array elements derived from the same genotypic virus. Based on the hybridization pattern and the sequence information of the probes, it is clearly possible to detect and type HAV.\\nOur results indicate that the microarray hybridization technique can be applied to the identification of different viruses present in a sample and detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) to identify closely related viral strains belonging to the same species [35](Ayodeji et al. 2009). However, the current protocols for SARS virus ([16]Wong et al., 2004), poliovirus ([5]Cherkasova et al., 2003; [6]Laassri et al., 2005),\\n17\\nand rotavirus ([38]Honma et al., 2007; [3]Chizhikov, et al., 2002), still depend on RT-PCR for target synthesis to be used in hybridization experiments. Using virus-specific RT-PCR assays requires prior knowledge of the virus to be expected in the sample hence potentially missing other viral disease agents that may be present in the sample but go undetected. Since current microarray allow of the use of up to 2 million probes in a single array, the potential for the detection and identification of many viral disease agents in a single experiment is not fully realized.\\nIn our laboratory, we have investigated whether viral targets can be obtained in sufficient quantities in a sequence non-specific manner to hybridize to a high density microarray containing greater than 100,000 probes representing all the known sequences (partial or complete) of the major foodborne viruses (NV, HAV, HEA, HEB and rotaviruses) and identify the viral strain (or strains) present in a sample. Synthesis of cDNA in a non-sequence specific manner was accomplished by reverse transcription of viral RNA using a mixture of random hexamers or olig(dT)15 to prime cDNA synthesis using viral RNA as template by AMV reverse transcriptase. This is essentially the initial step in current RT-PCR protocols. Reverse transcriptase requires a primer DNA or RNA) with a free 3’OH group hybridized to a template (DNA or RNA) to initiate cDNA synthesis. Viral RNAs that do not have a poly (A) sequence at their 3’end (such as rotavirus genomic RNA) cannot be primed by oligo (dT)15 and are primed by random hexamers. We then label the cDNA (see below for details). The synthesized targets are then hybridized to the probes on the microarray and the array scanned for hybridization signal (see Fig.1). Computer analysis of the signal by software developed for this\\n18\\npurpose is used to identify the virus species, genogroup and the strain within the genogroup.\\nSimaltaneous Detection of Mulitple HAV Genotypes\\nDetection of Noroviruses.\\nTo access the applicability of the tiling microarray for norovirus identification in a clinical setting, we examined three stool specimens isolated from infected patients.

The samples including noro#1, noroGI and #3263 have been genotyped via quantitative RT-PCR. They all belonged to genogroup I. As anticipated, hybridization to genogroup I-specific norovirus-derived oligoprobes was detected in all three virus samples. No cross-hybridization to noro genogroup II oligoprobes was observed. In sample of GI and #3263, strong hybridization to genogroup I specific sequence L07418 was obtained. In the meantime, hybridization to genogroup I specific sequence DQ340089 was also observed, whose signal was slightly lower than cut-off value. (Fig.2, 3). Viral RNA isolated from sample #1 was hybridized to a number of genogroup I-specific oligoprobes without cross-hybridization to genogroup II-specific oligoprobes (Fig. 4). Detailed nucleotide sequence identity with positive signal was listed in Table.5.\\nSaitamaU17 (GII)Fig 2.

A mixture of cDNA derived from the three viruses was hybridized to the microarray chip. As shown in Fig. 5, CXKV B3 displayed a clear-cut hybridization pattern distinguishable from other coxsackieviruses, making it possible to determine the virus serotype; Strong hybridization to the genotype IB oligoprobes was observed in HAV HM-175/18f although cross-hybridization to genotype IA oligoprobes also occurred (Table.6). In all positive hybridization, the average signal intensity ratio of IB-specific oligoprobes was 8.3 while IA was 4.2, which indicated that the array elements are capable of detecting and typing HAV. Good hybridization was observed between #3263 and genogroup I oligoprobes derived from noro1 L07418 sequence with signal intensity ratio of 3.9 (Table.6). Fig 5.

The insert shows close-up view of positively hybridized sequences derived from each virus.\\n23\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe long term objective is to use this technique to identify any viral agent present in the sample without investigator bias. Thus the proposed technological change will reveal a true picture of the viral disease agent and not just the confirmation of a notion based on vague symptoms of a disease. This is particularly important because many of the enteroviruses often show similar disease symptoms. It will also enable us to determine whether multiple strains or virus species are involved in a disease outbreak. Although we deem it unnecessary, the outcome of a microarray detection experiment can be independently verified using the more conventional PCR based amplification and sequencing or a second round of hybridization to a more narrowly focused less complex microarray with fewer probe features. We believe that the strength of the microarray technique is in the redundancy of probes used to interrogate a particular sequence making the technique essentially error-free. Variations in the probe sequences in the form of mutated probe oligonucleotides can be included in the array design to further increase the fidelity of virus identification and confidence in the result.\\nNoroviruses (NoV) and to a lesser extent HAV and human rotavirus (RV) are the most common foodborne viruses. Othe picornaviruses such as human enteric viruses A and B have at least the potential to be transmitted via person to person contact, through infected food handlers and contaminated foods. Current epidemiological studies indicate that NoV is responsible for the vast majority of food borne outbreaks in developed countries. The time frame of gastrointestinal disease caused by NoV is very unique due to the rapid onset of symptoms and easier to spot and a correlation to specific food consumption easier to establish that other viruses such as HEA or HEB or RV. The\\n24\\nsecond most common foodborne virus HAV has a rather long incubation period before disease symptoms become apparent. Epidemiological correlation to any specific food consumption thus is rather difficult to establish.\\nThe detection of food-borne viruses in clinical samples (mainly stool samples from outbreak investigations) is extremely difficult using cell culture due to the inability to grow NV and HAV in cultured cells. Hence molecular methods such as real-time RT-PCR are currently used for the detection of foodborne viruses in clinical samples. The current hypothesis developed from this need to broaden the scope of detection without sacrificing the sensitivity and rapidity of detection and the need to obtain more information from an experiment that is currently possible with RT-PCR.\\nThe strategy behind this proposal is to investigate whether food-borne virus detection and identification based on high density microarray hybridization currently being developed at Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) can be utilized for routine virus detection in FDA and other agencies such as CDC and Office of Regulatory Research (ORA) for the rapid detection and unambiguous identification (genotyping) of these viral disease agents from diverse source materials. Due to time limitation, we will concentrate our efforts on the detection of virus from stool samples from outbreak investigations available from CDC. Currently, outbreak investigations are geared to detecting and broad genogroup identification of the most common food borne virus NV. Due to the relative low frequency of other foodborne viral diseases, these viruses are usually not targeted. However, RNA virus populations are highly heterogeneous even within a particular genogroup, and genogroup identification using PCR primers based on consensus sequences are unable to identify the particular strain within the genogroup.\\n25\\nAnalysis of outbreak strain identification is therefore incomplete, since a particular strain within a genogroup may be responsible for the outbreak being studied. In addition, the narrow focus on a particular species of virus ignores other viruses that are also food-borne and may be present in a particular outbreak, which could have provided valuable information as to the source o[[File:Example.jpg]]f the outbreak.\\nConclusion:\\nWe hypothesize that advanced microarray design that incorporates probes for multiple virus species and strains will be able to provide the needed information to pinpoint the exact strain of the virus responsible for the outbreak, and also provide information as to the presence of other viruses that may be associated with that outbreak.\\nStatistical significance of array hybridization signals is computed using array package software where data points are calculated as signal intensity above normalized background (corrected to internal standards) and converted to average probe intensity (Jackson et al. 2007; Wong et al. 2004). Viral samples in the form of stool samples from outbreak investigations will be provided by CDC (NoV) and CBER (RV). The samples will have been typed by specific RT-PCR based methods prior to coding and then supplied to us for microarray experiments. Any initial negative hybridization will trigger a re-sampling and analysis due to the possibility of sampling error or a negative (no virus) sample. Sampling error rates and percent positive identification (following code breakage) will be used to determine statistical success rate of the microarray analysis. We realize that a sample with very low viral load may produce poor hybridization signal. In that case, the viral RNA will be amplified in a sequence non-specific manner using T7 RNA polymerase to preserve the original distribution.\\n26\\nThe success of our microarray screening protocol depends on target synthesis that is not specific to any particular virus. In our preliminary experiments we have achieved target synthesis for our microarray hybridization experiments by eliminating the PCR step by relying on a highly efficient synthesis and labeling of target. Viral RNA was purified from the all virus containing stool samples with a QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer primers. The resultant cDNA is fragmented by DNase 1 digestion and the mixture of the fragments is labeled with biotin-11-ddATP (PerkinElmer, MA) in the presence of Terminal Transferase (Invitrogen, CA). The use of ddATP assures that only a single nucleotide is added to the 3’end of each cDNA fragments and therefore the hybridization characteristics to the oligo-probes on the array is not altered. For signal amplification at the end of hybridization, the biotin in the target now hybridized to the probe is reacted with cy3 labeled streptavidin. The cy3 is detected by scanning and the scans analyzed for the detection of hybridization to specific probes on the array. An example of a typical result is shown in Fig.1. The applicability of this protocol in detecting a single species of virus is shown in Fig.2. The experiment detected genogroup I of NV, with the two peaks of average intensities identifying two different strains. Significantly, the microarray detected two different strains of group I NV in the same sample. The smaller peak has a 91% sequence identity to the main peak supporting our hypothesis (see above) that outbreak samples may contain multiple NV strains that can only be detected using microarray.\\nThe second hypothesis that we propose to test is that microarray hybridization can detect multiple viruses in the same experiment if the target is synthesized and labeled\\n27\\nusing technology that are not dependent on sequence specific PCR amplification. An example is shown in Fig.5 from a recent experiment carried out in our laboratory. RNA samples from three different viruses HAV (genotype HM175), NoV (Group I) and HEB (strain CVB 3) were separately reverse transcribed and labeled as described above. The labeled cDNAs were mixed in equimolar quantities and hybridized. Analysis of hybridization data show that all three viruses were identified. In addition to the HAV and CV strains, the array experiment again identified two closely related strains of NoV as seen in Fig.2, that could not be distinguished by RT-PCR.\\nExpected Outcomes:\\nExperiments performed in different laboratories that have used microarray technology for virus detection and identification have concluded that the potential benefits of the use of microarrays in diagnostic settings is very high. The ability of the microarray for virus identification is attested by the proliferation of virus species that are being examined using this technology (Wong et al., 2004 for SARS coronavirus, Laasari et al. 2005, for Poliovirus, Honma et al. 2007, Chizikov et al. 2002, for rotavirus, Ryabinin et al. 2006, for orthopox virus, Deregt et al. 2006, for swine fever virus, Ayodeji et al. 2009, for hepatitis A and human enteric viruses A and B. The dependence on RT-PCR for target synthesis however has restricted the realization of the full potential of the microarray for multiple virus identification in a single experiment. We have shown by eliminating the PCR step during target synthesis that NoV, HAV and human enterovirus can be identified in the same analyte (Fig.3). Comparison of hybridization intensities from targets synthesized from two different strains of the same virus species can identify nucleotide changes in the virus genome occurring over time (Wong et al. 2004; Ayodeji et.al.\\n28\\n2009). As shown in Fig.3, perhaps the greatest advantage of this technique is to identify a virus strain in the absence of any prior knowledge of the sequence of the virus in the sample by eliminating the need for PCR. Eliminating the need for PCR does not reduce the sensitivity to the level that the virus can no longer be detected (Fig.3). Conceivably it is possible that such a situation will be encountered in samples with very low viral load. In such cases a sequence non-specific RNA amplification procedure may be used to increase the sensitivity. We have to yet test this hypothesis. The other advantage accruing to the agency will be the ability to identify emerging virus strains which are not detectable due to change of sequence at the PCR primer binding site on the genome, and the need for sequencing every PCR product.\\nCurrently, a vaccine against HAV, the second most prevalent foodborne disease is available for prophylactic use. However, a vaccine against NoV is not available to prevent NoV outbreaks. Even where a vaccine for a particular virus is available, vaccination programs to prevent viral disease outbreaks have to be initiated well in advance of a disease outbreak in order to allow time for the targeted population to develop immunity. Another drawback is that viruses frequently mutate to escape immunity as well as to become resistant to antivirals. The microarray data can be of value to provide indication to health officials if resistance strains are emerging and provide sufficient time to change the strategy for controlling an outbreak.\\nEND END\\n29\\nAcknowledgement:\\nThe author wishes to acknowledge the full financial support of the Food and Drug Administration for the work carried out while he was an employee of the Federal Government of the United States of America.\\nReferences:\\n[1] Verhoef LPB, Kroneman A, van Duynhoven Y, Boshuizen H, van Pelt W, Koopmans M.

Briefly, Biotinylated cDNA in the presence of Affymetrix hybridization buffer was hybridized to the microarray chip in a total volume of 120 μl. Before application to the array, the samples were heated to 98 °C for 1 min, cooled at 45 °C for another 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 5 min. The microarray chip was then incubated at 45 °C for 16 hrs in a hybridization oven. Following hybridization, the wash and stain procedures were carried out by the Fluidics station (Affymetrix, CA). All arrays were imaged by using Affymetrix microarray scanner at a resolution of 10 μm per pixel. Signal intensity of the hybridization was extracted by using Affymetrix power tools, and the subsequent data analysis was performed using MS Excel. For each viral genome represented on the array, the average signal intensity for all the probes within that genome was determined. The average intensity is first determined as described by Jackson et al. (16), and Ayodeji et al. (17). Each average genome intensity was then normalized by the average intensity of all the probes represented on the array. To minimize effects of nonspecific hybridization, an empirical cutoff value of 3 was considered as a threshold value for a positive signal. Microarray hybridization data were then converted to color visualization schemes in which hybridization signal intensity is reflected by the color scale of vertical strips.\\nValidation of Norovirus Microarray Genotyping. To confirm the microarray genotyping result of the norovirus sample #186 (NoV#186), we performed a specific PCR with a published primer set G1SKF (5’-CTGCCCGAATTYGTAAATGA-3’) and G1SKR (5’-CCAACCCARCCATTRTACA-3’); G2SKF (5’-\\n34\\nCNTGGGAGGGCGATCGCAA-3’) and G2SKR (5’-CCRCCNGCATRHCCRTTRTACAT-3’; Y=C/T; N=A/T/G/C; R=A/G; H=A/T/C). This pair of primer was used for the amplification of genogroup I and group II norovirus. (Kojima, S., Kageyama, T., Fukushi, S.,et.al. (2002). Genogroup-specific PCR primers for detection of nowalk-like viruses. J Virol Methods. 100: 107-114.) The PCR was carried out as described previously (Kojima, S. above). The amplicon was sequenced and its relationship to known NoV strains were determined by phylogentics analysis program ClustalX as described by Thompson et. al. (1997). (Thompson J.D., Gibson,T.J., Plewniak,F., Jeanmougin,F. and Higgins,D.G. (1997) The CLUSTAL_X windows interface: flexible strategies for multiple sequence alignment aided by quality analysis tools. Nucleic Acids Res., 25, 4876–4882.). A phylogentic tree from boot-strap analysis was generated by Neibour-Joining method. Other norovirus samples were genotyped by Dr. William Burkhardt (FDA, Dauphin Island, AL) and by Dr. Jan Vinje (CDC, Atlanta, GA) via RT-PCR.\\nHybridization Profile of coxsackieviruses A and B and different strains of HAV\\n35\\nCXKV A2Fig 1.

The labeled cDNAs were mixed in equimolar quantities and hybridized. Analysis of hybridization data show that all three viruses were identified. In addition to the HAV and CV strains, the array experiment again identified two closely related strains of NoV as seen in Fig.2, that could not be distinguished by RT-PCR.
Individualist cultures are those in which people are on a whole loosely connected to each other and prefer to be identified as an individual. Self-importance, promotion, and achievement are highly valued. Competition is encouraged more than cooperation. Individualist cultures expect one to act for self-promotion and self-advancement in the job market. There is also competitiveness in social situations,where people are expected to fend for themselves and any sign of assistance (i.e. - getting set-up on a blind date)can be seen as a sign of weakness. Parental approval is helpful to have in situations such as marriage, but not necessary. People in an individualist culture place more importance on their own interests than the interests of other members of the culture.\\n\\nIndividualistic cultures place emphasis on the "I"consciousness.  These cultures are very competitive and self-centered, as opposed to the cooperation and loyalty focused values of a collectivist culture.  Individualistsvalue their privacy and usually indentify themselves as independent from the group indentity.  The JMU campus, for example, is largely individualistic.  The faculty, staff, and students of JMU are not necessarily unfriendly or unhelpful towards one another, but each student is competitive for the top grades and academic standing.  One will rarely ever witness a college student studying for hours on end in order to help his or her classmate achieve an A on an exam. Overall, individualist cultures emphasize individual goals,independence, privacy, and self-help.
==Quantitative Taxonomy of Wikipedia Editors==\\n\\n===Abstract===\\nSome quantitative methods for categorizing Wikipedia editors and their editing styles are described. \\n\\n===Introduction===\\nWikipedia is one of the most popular websites on the internet. It is composed of several million articles written in over 250 different languages. Wikipedia is created by  thousands of volunteer editors, who are guided by a set of policies, principles, guidelines, conventions and traditions. Different editors are involved in a wide variety of tasks, and exhibit different editing styles. \\n\\nThere are many reasons to categorize editing styles on Wikipedia. For example, not all editing styles contribute equally to the production of Wikipedia, and it is valuable to understand which styles are more useful to Wikipedia and in what circumstances. Recognizing unproductive or inefficient behavior and measuring it's characteristics  can be useful in the creation of evidence-based management systems, which hopefully will replace the current intuition-based management systems. For example, when selecting editors for promotion to administrative positions, or other positions of responsibility, current methods can skew the selection process towards those with limited forms of editing experience. Gauging editing styles and experiences can allow a conscious decision to avoid certain kinds of editors, to create a wider diversity of candidates, or to otherwise assist in the selection process. Also, measuring the results of certain administrative actions or imposition of policy changes can be valuable information for evaluating the appropriateness of these actions and changes.\\n\\nQuantitative methods of analysis are often desirable. Quantitative methods are amenable to automation and computer implementation, which is appropriate for a computer-based document production project.  Numerically-based procedures can reveal features of situations that are not readily apparent to less exacting and rigorous methods.
What UP does:\\n\\nUP is a group of under-30s based in London in the UK who want to support people of their own age affected by depression. Their aim is to raise awareness of depression, promote understanding of mental health issues and work to reduce the stigma that might prevent depression sufferers seeking help. UP is there to encourage seeking the best support to help individuals, families and friends learn to overcome the illness, improve quality of life and realise potential.\\n\\nUP is part of the Charlie Waller Memorial Trust (CWMT).\\n\\nWhy target young people?\\n\\nDepression is widespread among the under-30s. This age group often struggle to cope with the pressures of education, work, money, relationships and simply finding their way in the world. Sadly, it is also the age group most likely to try to cover up any mental health issues.\\n\\nUnwarranted shame, lack of information or believing that this age group should just ’pull their socks up‘ mean that they’re often unable to admit to friends, family or even themselves that something’s wrong. But with depression, something is badly wrong.\\n\\nUP believes it shouldn’t be this way. UP promotes finding the correct treatment, that really works; currently in the UK there’s no clear path to getting help. Often the most common answer to the question “what would you do if you felt depressed, or worried that a friend might be?” is “I don’t know”. UP wants to answer that question and provide a gateway to the support that may be needed.
'''What is Sustainable Tourism?'''\\n\\nSustainable tourism is a form of tourism that provides economic, social, and environmental benefits through the knowledgeable management of tourism resources. Long-term sustainability is achieved without losing any local cultural identity or natural values.\\n\\nBoth tourist operators and tourists can help achieve sustainable tourism.\\n\\n'''What kinds of tourism are sustainable?'''\\n \\nECOTOURISM : Ecotourism is a form of tourism that occurs in natural areas and integrates the local socio-cultural identity with ecosystem considerations. It promotes a sustainable ecosystem through a participatory environmental management processes involving all stakeholders.\\n \\nHEALTH TOURISM : Health tourism is a form of tourism involving activities that deliberately promote good health. Examples of health tourism include visiting exercise or meditation centres or resorts that provide health services or specialise in vegetariam food. Such visits are typically of a specified duration, such as 3,5, or 7 days.\\n \\nAGROTOURISM : Agrotourism is a form of tourism in agricultural areas such as orchards, agroforestry farms, herbal farms and animal farms, which have been prepared in some way for the tourists. More importantly, tourists gain experience in farming activities such as working with animals or harvesting crops, usually under the supervision of a farm guide. Lecture describing the operation of the farm may also be given.\\n \\nCULTURAL TOURISM : Cultural tourism is a form of tourism that allows tourists to admire and learn about local cultures and tradition. The local community participates in the management of this form of tourism, which is based on the principle of conserving local culture and the environment. Examples of culture-based tourism include visiting the Royal Court or experiencing local life in a hill-tribe village\\n\\n'''Every kind of existing tourism operation can become Sustainable Tourism if tourism managers take responsibility for the destinations socio-cultural and natural environment.'''
After practicing law for 29+ years I am amazed that I seem to be the only counsel that has been consistently using the term "fraudulator" to define, generally, one who actively engages in fraudulent, deceptive, and misrepresentative type behavior.  Fraud is precisely defined in Federal and State statutes, and has become part of American and English lexicon in terms of "common law" deliberate deceptions for unfair and/or unlawful gain and advantage.  It is also generally defined as a swindle or a trick, and has been known to describe an imposter.\\n\\nBut, I have yet to see or read about anyone who is consistently or chronically involved in this type of conduct as being a "FRAUDULATOR".\\n\\nI believe this word should be added to common dictionaries and particularly "BLACK's LAW DICTIONARY" as a word that best articulates the true sense of the root-word, Fraud, when describing an individual and/or entity that engages in intentional fraudulent and deceptive conduct.  \\n\\nThank you in advance for your comments.
                                      '''\\n                                        '''''Contemporary society''''' ''                \\n\\nContemporary society, according to social and political scientists, is characterised by at least three fundamental directions:\\n* '''increasing human interconnection''' through a network of relationships that is progressively covering the whole planet;\\n* '''the pace and depth of the evolution of human ways of life''' determined by technological innovation represent an absolute novelty in human history;\\n* the scale of '''anthropological and and ecological transformation''' due to the interaction between evolutionary factors (social, cultural, economic, and technological) has no historical precedent.\\n\\nThese directions are the result of a number of fundamental changes that are irreversibly transforming our daily lives, our way of thinking and perceiving the world and our way of living together. Among these fundamental changes are: improvements in life conditions, life expectancy, literacy and gender equality; changes in domestic and international political institutions; and the breakdown of natural equilibria.\\n\\n\\n==Improvement of life conditions==\\nThe UN estimates that, at the beginning of the 20th century, about 60% of the world population lived in conditions of extreme poverty. In 1981, 40% of the world population lived extreme poverty. In 2001, the percentage had been halved to 20%.\\nSeveral developing countries, in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa, still suffer from social and economic backwardness, but life conditions have significantly improved in most regions of the world, in particular in Asia. \\nThe overall improvement in life conditions and the role of technologies now available have contributed to increase GDP per capita by one and a half times in less than half a century (1960-2005), with peaks of over eight times in Eastern Asia. Only in a few countries, concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, growth of per capita income has been very slow.\\n\\n\\n==Life expectancy==\\nIn 1960, the average life expectancy of the world population was 50 years. Forty-five years later, in 2004, life expectancy had improved by over 30% to 67 years. Improvements in health care and the reduction in child mortality have led to a jump forward in middle-income countries, where life expectancy is now over 70 years. In high-income countries life expectancy is now over 80 years, extending well beyond the traditional length of working life, causing social and economic problems.\\n\\n\\n==Literacy and gender equality==\\nThe ability to read and write is next to universal: in 2004, 80% of adult men and 73% of adult women had basic literacy skills. Of great social importance is the rapid growth of female school enrollment and the increasing presence of women in the labour market. These deep changes constitute a primary driver of economic growth in developing countries.\\nFemale literacy has great consequences in terms of fertility. When female school enrollment and employment rates increase, fertility rates decline rapidly and tend to stabilise around the natural rate of reproduction of 2.1 children per women (see E. Todd, "After the Empire"). Several demographers believe that, as a consequence, world population will stabilise over the next few decades, at a level compatible with the resources of the planet [reference].\\n\\n\\n==Spread of communication technologies==\\nThe world population has a number of "passive" (broadcasting) communication technologies (radio, television) that cover the whole globe. Moreover, a large portion of the population uses "active" commmunication technologies (telephone, internet). Internet connections are expanding rapidly: in 2004 there were 140 Internet users every 1000 inhabitants (according to data from the "International Communication Union"). The spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) is remodelling the material fundaments of society. The sociologist [[Manuel_Castells|Castells]] believes that these technologies have started a revolution of the productive structures of society and of daily life.\\n\\nThe new communication technologies represent a critical instrument to obtain consensus and as a result they are transforming the organisational models of the State and of politics. The power system becomes less visible but more pervasive in the way it can influence choices and ways of thinking Manuel_Castells|M. Castells]], "Galassia Internet", Feltrinelli, [[2002]]).\\n\\n\\n==Economic growth and evolution of political institutions==\\nThe economic success of authoritarian regimes, mainly in Asia, suggests that (at least in the short term) economic growth is independent from the democratisation of political institutions. However, economic development favours the development of democratic institutions--but only if economic growth leads to substantial changes in cultural and social structures. ([[Ronald Inglehart|R. Inglehart]], "La società postmoderna").\\nThe "World Values Survey", which captures political values in 43 countries, shows that no country with a per capita income below the poverty line has democratic or free institutions. Almost the totality of nations with high per capita income are classified as democratic.\\n\\n==Globalisation==\\nOver the last fifty years, world GDP has increased by about five times, while trade has increased ten-fold over the same period. These data suggests that the intensity of the commercial exchange between countries has developed faster than the overall economy. However, globalisation has gone beyond the exchange of physical commodities and it is progressively modelling also the lifestyles and consumption patterns of individuals and societies. The Swiss think-tank KOF has developed a number of globalisation indicators that show the increasing development of global individual, social and commercial networks.\\n\\n\\n==Social tension and opposition to change==\\nNew international flows have diminished the role of traditional political institutions--sometimes with negative consequences for social stability. In many societies, stability (or slow evolution) has been substituted by unstoppable and irreversable transformations.\\nAs a result, individuals and communities perceive a high degree of insecurity--insecurity that touches every aspect of their lives. Growing masses of people feel threatened by the changes that affect their material (work, income, house), psychological (personal relationships), and cultural life (with the need to continuously update knowledge and professional skills)[[Digital divide|it.Wikipedia.org "Digital divide"]]).\\nThe social improvement of the masses --resulting from increasing literacy and income, universal means of communication and a new social role of women-- has eroded the traditional role of the elites and have weakened the traditional regulatory role of the state.\\nAs the speed of social and cultural evolution sweeps away old life habits, religious beliefs, ancestral moral convictions and radicated political opinions, the anxiety towards a future that is mutating and unknown causes a cultural opposition that is at the root of fundamentalism. Opposition against new life conditions is justified also by increasing economic inequality: "the gap between the wealth of the North and that of the South of the world has increased by a multiple of five since the beginning of the XX century" ({{in lang|fr}} [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cohen_%28%C3%A9conomiste%29 Daniel Cohen], "Trois leçons sur la société postindustrielle").\\n\\n\\n==Breakdown of natural equilibria==\\nWhen demographic growth is multiplied by the growth of per capita income and consumption, one can have a measure of the global impact on environmental sustainability. Demographic and economic development is endangering our current forms of civilisation and social co-living and our future ability to inhabit our planet.\\nAlternative scenarios developed by international organisations suggest the possibility of a serious breakdown of natural equilibrium unless political, scientific and economic tools are directed to a correction towards an acceptable equilibrium between humankind and with nature.\\n\\n\\n== Related voices==\\n* {{in lang|en}} [[:en:Samir Amin|Samir Amin]]\\n* [[Zygmunt Bauman]]\\n* [[Manuel Castells]]\\n* [[Derrick de Kerckhove]]\\n* [[Anthony Giddens]]\\n* [[Jack Goody]]\\n* [[Ronald Inglehart]]\\n* [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Levy]]\\n* [[Nicholas Negroponte]]\\n* [[Emmanuel Todd]]\\n* [[Immanuel Wallerstein]]\\n* {{in lang|en}} [[:en:Martin Wolf|Martin Wolf]]\\n* [[Postmaterialismo]]\\n* {{in lang|ca}} [http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moviments_socials Moviments socials]\\n\\n==Sources==\\n* World Bank: World Development Indicators Online database [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20398986~menuPK:64133163~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html]\\n* World Bank: Social Indicators of Development 2004\\n* World Bank: Data & Statistics, 2001\\n* World Bank: International Telecommunications Union\\n* Human Development Index\\n* UNO Yearbook 2004\\n* World Value Survey\\n* Eurobarometro\\n* Konjunkturforschungsstelle (KOF): Index of Globalization 2004\\n* International Monetary Fund: World Economic and Financial Survey 2006\\n* UNESCO/OECD: World Education Indicators Programme 1999\\n* United Nations Development Program: Human Development Report 2004\\n* United Nations Population Division: World Population Prospect, 2000\\n\\n==Bibliography (in Italian)==\\n* Krishan Kumar, "Le nuove teorie del mondo contemporaneo" 2000\\n* Martin Wolf, "Perché la globalizzazione funziona" 2006\\n* Ulrich Beck, "Cos'è la globalizzazione" 1999\\n* Peter Sloterdijk, "Breve storia filosofica della globalizzazione" 2002\\n* Peter Sloterdijk, "La morte nel postumanismo" 2004\\n* Peter Sloterdijk, "Non siamo ancora stati salvati" 2001\\n* Jack Goody, "Capitalismo e modernità" 2005\\n* Samir Amin, "Il capitalismo nell'era della globalizzazione" 1997\\n* Zygmunt Bauman, "Dentro la globalizzazione" 2001\\n* Pierre Lévy, "les tecnologies de l'intelligence" 1990\\n* Nicholas Negroponte, "Essere digitali" 1990\\n* Manuel Castells, "Il potere dell'identità" 2003\\n* Manuel Castells, "Galassia internet" 2002\\n* Manuel Castells, "La nascita della società in rete" 2002\\n* Derrick de Kerckhove (a cura di), "Brainframes" 1991\\n* Mark Dery, "Velocità di fuga" 1997\\n* Kevin Robins, "Oltre l'immagine" 1999\\n* Remo Bodei, "Destini personali" 2002\\n* Michel Foucault, "Tecnologie del sè" 1992\\n* Antony Giddens, "La Trasformazione dell'intimità" 1995\\n* Emmanuel Todd, "Dopo l'impero" 2003\\n* Ronald Inglehart, "La società postmoderna" 1998\\n* Daniel Cohen, " Trois leçons sur la société postindustrielle" 2005
'''Academic Art''', a style of painting and sculpture, particularly the style sanctioned by the French Académie des Beaux-Arts in the 19th century. Although the French Academy was then the dominant arbiter of artistic taste, it had influential counterparts in other nations, particularly the Royal Academy in England. The annual exhibitions, or salons, of the national academies featured the work of members and other work selected by a jury. Most salon art reflected the taste of the new bourgeoisie, which was often sentimental and literary, with cultural pretensions.\\n\\nAcademic art was characterized by a respect for classical antiquity, faithful transcription of nature, illusionistic space, minute detail, and eclectic borrowing from the past. It was basically retrogressive, with an emphasis on traditionalism, and usually lacked originality. It was against the canons of academic art that the progressive artists of the 19th century constantly battled, and their reaction against it led to the rise of styles that were diametrically opposed to the academic.\\n\\nThe birth of impressionism in the 1870s brought the dominance of academic art to an end. In the 20th century, when the intense opposition to academic art had diminished, some merits were found in it as a reflection of its time and for its sound technique.
---> Side 7\\n\\nLe Roy Ladurie has also worked on the history of French regions (''Histoire de France des régions'', 2004) and on [[anthropometric history]] as well as on the impact of climate changes on human history. Besides writing books, Le Roy Ladurie is a prolific essayist writing on variety of subjects such as the utility of computers as method of historical research, rates of delinquency in the French Army in the 19th century, the spread of global diseases and the belief of French peasants that magic could be used to generate impotence. The latter was a reference to the widespread practice of French peasant men in the Middle Ages and the early modern period of paying witches to use their (supposed) magical powers to make their rivals in love go impotent. Le Roy Ladurie is also known as one of the first modern [[environmental historian]]s because his work focused on human agency in environmental change, as well as environmental factors in human history.

For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing [[fluorescent lights]] or natural [[Skylight (window)|skylights]] reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared with using traditional [[incandescent light bulbs]]. [[Compact fluorescent lights]] use one-third the energy of incandescent lights and may last 6 to 10 times longer.  Improvements in energy efficiency are generally achieved by adopting a more efficient technology or production processes or by application of commonly accepted methods to reduce energy losses.\\n\\nThere are many motivations to improve energy efficiency.  Reducing energy use reduces energy costs and may result in a financial cost saving to consumers if the energy savings offset any additional costs of implementing an energy efficient technology.  Reducing energy use is also seen as a solution to the problem of reducing carbon dioxide emissions.  According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[Energy efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[Sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases. \\n\\nEnergy efficiency and [[renewable energy]] are said to be the ''twin pillars'' of [[sustainable energy]] policy and are high priorities in the sustainable [[energy hierarchy]]. In many countries energy efficiency is also seen to have a national security benefit because it can be used to reduce the level of energy imports from foreign countries and may slow down the rate at which domestic energy resources are depleted.\\n|link=Efficient energy use\\n}}
'''Non-kinetic operations'''\\n\\n"active, as opposed to latent." Dropping bombs and shooting bullets—you know, killing people—is kinetic. But the 21st-century military is exploring less violent and more high-tech means of warfare, such as messing electronically with the enemy's communications equipment or wiping out its bank accounts. These are "non-kinetic."\\n\\n\\nThe kinetic part is easily defined: using the military to kill\\nterrorists “with a global reach,” disrupt their infrastructure,\\nand dissuade those who fund terrorists and their state sponsors upon threat (and occasionally actual visitation) of physical injury.\\n\\nThe nonkinetic parts are often euphemized as the “drain\\nthe swamp” or, better, the “hearts and minds” problem. These\\nnonmilitary aspects focus on terrorism’s motivation and\\nrecruitment patterns, the sociology of terrorist groups that\\nleads them to mobilize, compete, and strike; and the underlying social conditions said to feed that motivation and those\\nrecruitment patterns.\\n\\n\\nGetting at the nonkinetic aspects of the war on terrorism\\ncan be conceived as consisting of immediate, midterm, and\\nlong-term parts. The essence at all stages, however, appears to\\nbe fourfold:\\n#Stigmatize the idea of murdering civilians for any political cause whatsoever, just as slavery, piracy, and human ritual sacrifice were so stigmatized in previous generations.\\n#Identify and stop the flow of money and other resources at all levels from those who approve of terrorism to those who carry it out, redirecting that money and those resources to positive ends, as possible.\\n#Refute, tirelessly and skillfully, the almost endless distortions of U.S. policies and motivations that are promulgated by Islamist propagandists (and others) and that inexorably make Americans and their allies targets of hatred and violence.\\n#Work patiently at social, economic, and political reform (generally in that order) in Muslim-majority countries and among Muslim communities outside the Middle East and South Asia where terrorist cadres are known to have arisen.\\n\\n\\nNonkinetic operations. Training units in non-kinetic operations requires establishing an environment in which human terrain predominates. In such an environment, units can employ nonkinetic resources such as civil affairs (CA) and psychological operations (PSYOP) teams and public affairs officers; and they can conduct leader engagements, disburse money, and participate in reconstruction. to provide the human terrain necessary to train nonkinetic operations, the NTC populates its towns and villages with up to 1,600 role players, of which 250 are Iraqi-Americans who remain in their roles and live in the field for the entire 14-day training event. Each role player is influenced by respective tribal and religious leaders and maintains familial, social, and business relationships throughout the rotation. Some role players have businesses and jobs; others are unemployed and disenfranchised, ripe for insurgent recruitment. Each urban area has its own government structure, police force, businesses, criminal element, and ethnic tension. Provincial government and police forces also exert influence on towns and villages.\\n\\nThe human terrain element makes leaders and soldiers engage with real Iraqis, a function that requires them to adapt to Iraqi culture and seek cooperation. Leaders conduct engagements and negotiate with provincial, town, and tribal leaders to gather information on insurgent activity and to find out who can create jobs, provide medical aid, or develop reconstruction projects. The human element also allows the training unit to employ CA and PSYOP teams throughout its area of operations to influence the role players. Iraqi role players' attitudes change based on unit actions.\\n\\nThe recently constructed Joint coordination center, modeled after facilities in theater, is the focal point of nonkinetic operations. It serves as a coordination center for those acting as coalition forces; Iraqi security forces; local government, tribal and religious leaders; local security and medical personnel; and nongovernmental organization (NGO) workers.\\n\\n\\na Kinetic warfare situation where we are in all out war: dropping bombs, rolling in with tanks, shooting everything that moves. We have since moved on from a Kinetic warfare situation to a Expanded Warfare situation where our primary concerns are to maintain order, repair infrastructure, implement domestic services, and conduct warfare operations against those that wish to disrupt the previous objectives.
'''Coral Reefs'''\\n     Coral reefs are very important ecosystems in our oceans. They are found in tropical areas that have clear, warm water. Coral reefs are formed by polyps that secrete hard calcareous exoskeletons, giving an amazingly firm structure. These colonial “hard corals” form elaborate finger-shaped, branching, or mound shaped structures and can create masses of limestone that stretch for tens or even hundreds of miles. These corals continue to build on top of the skeletal remains of older colonies and eventually a reef is established. Today, richly diverse coral reefs are found in the tropics along coastlines, on the margins of volcanic islands, and as isolated coral atolls. According to a website I found, coral reefs are home to over 25 percent of all marine life and are among the world's most fragile and endangered ecosystems. In the last few decades over 35 million acres of coral reefs have been destroyed and many other reefs have been damaged. One of the major threats to coral reefs is coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which corals lose their distinctive color because they expel the zooxanthellae that live within them. This bleaching is caused by stress to the corals. If a coral is fully bleached, it will turn entirely white, and will die unless the stress on the coral is reduced, allowing the zooxanthellae to return to the coral. The main causes of stress to the coral reefs are the rising water temperatures of the ocean and increased ultraviolet radiation. Two other factors that are believed to be causing stress to the reefs are increased salinity and increased sedimentation. Coral reefs are important, because they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and help regulate atmospheric temperatures, they protect our coastlines from erosion, act as homes to many marine animals, they are used for fishing, provide people with jobs, and of course they play a significant role in tourism.\\n\\nEnvironmental News Network staff.

Physics (Greek: physis – φύσις meaning "nature") is a natural science that involves the study of matter, its motion through spacetime, and all allied components, such as energy and force. This has led to the discovery and understanding of the laws and principles which govern the physical universe. More broadly, Physics is the general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the world and universe behave. One tool which helps with this general analysis is the study of the elementary constituents of the universe and their interactions.\\n\\nPhysics is one of the oldest academic disciplines, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy. Evidence exists that the earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000 BCE, such as the Sumerians, Ancient Egyptians, and the Indus Valley Civilization, all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. Although originally part of other physical sciences and mathematics, Physics emerged to become a unique modern science during the Scientific Revolution of the 16th century.\\n\\nPhysics is both significant and influential, in part because advances in its understanding have often translated into new technologies, but also because new ideas in physics often resonate with other sciences, mathematics, and philosophy. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products which have dramatically transformed modern-day society (e.g., television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons); advances in thermodynamics led to the development of motorized transport; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.\\n\\nPhysics also has philosophical implications. It can be historically traced back to ancient Greek philosophy. From Thales' first attempt to characterize matter, to Democritus' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state, the Ptolemaic astronomy of a crystalline firmament, and Aristotle's book Physics, different Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature. Well into the 18th century, physics was known as "Natural philosophy". By the 19th century physics was realized as a positive science and a distinct discipline separate from philosophy and the other sciences. Physics, as with the rest of science, relies on philosophy of science to give an adequate description of the scientific method.\\n\\n\\nMore about physics\\nedit  \\nSelected article\\nPortrait of Galileo Galilei by Giusto Sustermans\\n\\n    Galileo Galilei was an Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who played a major role in the Scientific Revolution. His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations and support for Copernicanism. Galileo has been called the "father of modern observational astronomy", the "father of modern physics", the "father of science", and "the Father of Modern Science".\\n\\nHis contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter (named the Galilean moons in his honour), and the observation and analysis of sunspots. Galileo also worked in applied science and technology, inventing an improved military compass and other instruments.\\n\\nGalileo's championing of heliocentrism was controversial within his lifetime, when most subscribed to either geocentrism or the Tychonic system.[9] He met with opposition from astronomers, who doubted heliocentrism due to the absence of an observed stellar parallax. The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, and they concluded that it could only be supported as a possibility, not as an established fact. Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point. He was tried by the Inquisition, found "vehemently suspect of heresy", forced to recant, and spent the rest of his life under house arrest. It was while Galileo was under house arrest that he wrote one of his finest works, Two New Sciences. Here he summarized the work he had done some forty years earlier, on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials.\\n\\n    Classical mechanics describes the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, as well as astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, stars, and galaxies. Within these domains, it produces very accurate results. And thus, is one of the oldest and largest subjects in science, engineering and technology. Besides this, many related specialties deal with gases, liquids, and solids, and so on. In addition, classical mechanics is enhanced by special relativity for high velocity objects that are approaching the speed of light. General relativity is employed to handle gravitation at a deeper level, and finally, quantum mechanics handles the wave-particle duality of atoms and molecules.\\n\\nMore selected articles\\nedit  \\nSelected picture\\n\\nThe Hubble Deep Field (HDF) is an image of a small region in the constellation Ursa Major, constructed from a series of observations by the Hubble Space Telescope.

For instance, building a positive community is integral to the workings of an Ecovillage. As these groups are quite small, members need to feel empowered, included and comfortable speaking and sharing ideas. As well, cultural and spiritual practices are encouraged - such an an understanding of the interconnectedness of the earth.\\nEcologically, Ecovillages allow people to be connected to the earth. Members respect their environment as it provides them with the majority of their sustenance. Villages grow the majority of their food organically, use local materials for their buildings, protect biodiversity and growing seasons and protect local water, soil and air. The majority of the practices undertaken by Ecovillages aim to take care of the land. \\nEcovillages demonstrate a unique economic dimension, as money is kept within the community and is circulated between members. Income is often generated through the retail of their products and services and recycled to improve everyone in the community.\\n<ref{{cite web|title=Dimensions of an Ecovillage|url=http://gen.ecovillage.org/ecovillages/4pillarsofsustainability.html|accessdate=March 20 2012}}/ref>\\n\\n\\nWith the increasing evidence of human-initiated climate change, people throughout the world are coming together to try to reduce their carbon-footprint. Groups are trying to move away from the dependence of fossil fuels and consumerist practices. There is a focus on producing and consuming locally, forging meaningful relationships and living as sustainably as possible. Many initiatives are encouraged such as: reducing energy use, creating sustainable local businesses, localizing farming and creating environmentally minded communities.
     Did you know that there is another disastrous event aside from global warming?\\nIt is called global dimming.Global dimming is the gradual reduction in the amount of global hemispherical irradiance (or total solar irradiance) at the Earth's surface, observed since the beginning of systematic measurements in 1950s. The effect varies by location, but worldwide it is of the order of a 5% reduction over the three decades from 1960–1990. This trend has reversed during the past decade. Global dimming creates a cooling effect that may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.\\n\\n     It is currently thought that the effect of global dimming is probably due to the increased presence of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Aerosol particles and other particulate pollutants absorb solar energy and reflect sunlight back into space. The pollutants can also become nuclei for cloud droplets. It is thought that the water droplets in clouds coalesce around the particles. Increased pollution, resulting in more particulates, creates clouds consisting of a greater number of smaller droplets, which in turn makes them more reflective, therefore bouncing more sunlight back into space.\\n\\n     Clouds intercept both heat from the sun and heat radiated from the Earth. Their effects are complex and vary in time, location and altitude. Usually during the daytime the interception of sunlight predominates, giving a cooling effect; however, at night the re-radiation of heat to the Earth slows the Earth's heat loss.\\n\\n     Early reports of "global dimming" attracted little interest, perhaps because the term itself had not yet been coined. The earliest reports seem to be by M. Budyko: "The effect of solar radiation variations on the climate of the Earth" in 1969, published in Tellus. From the late 1980s onwards, scientists independently began working on solar radiation datasets and discovered declining trends worldwide; Atsumo Ohmura Secular variation of global radiation in Europe in 1989; Vivii Russak in 1990 "Trends of solar radiation, cloudiness and atmospheric transparency during recent decades in Estonia", and Beate Liepert in 1994 "Solar radiation in Germany - Observed trends and an assessment of their causes". Gerry Stanhill who studied these declines worldwide in many papers coined the term "dimming". Dimming exists in sites all over the Former Soviet Union.\\n\\n     Independent research in Israel and the Netherlands in the late 1980s showed an apparent reduction in the amount of sunlight, despite widespread evidence that the climate was actually becoming hotter. The rate of dimming varies around the world but is on average estimated at around 2–3% per decade, with the possibility that the trend reversed in the early 1990s. It is difficult to make a precise measurement, due to the difficulty in accurately calibrating the instruments used, and the problem of spatial coverage. Nonetheless, the effect is almost certainly present.\\n\\n     The effect is due to changes within the Earth's atmosphere; the value of the solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere has not changed by more than a fraction of this amount.

The researchers found that those who had experienced WRIST FRACTURES were fifty percent more likely to suffer a disability later on down the road than those who had not suffered a fracture at all. Note that this study did take into effect such things as life styles and demographics into account of the participants studied.\\n\\nWhile the study might not contain some interesting statistics, it does emphasize the need to prevent falls in the home as much as possible. Elderly people, and their caregivers if they have them, need to be very aware of fall risks like steps, thresholds, loose rugs, clutter and anything that could cause a fall.\\n\\nIt's also important for someone who has had a wrist fracture to view the study in the proper light and not be discouraged thinking that it means there's double the chance of becoming disabled. The most likely conclusion to take away is that a person with a broken wrist is more likely to end up with a disability because they fell while others didn't and not because of the broken wrist itself.\\n\\nhttp://www.samiralgazzar.com/article-1313.html
               The spate of recent terrorist attacks on Bombay only goes to evince the fact as to how vulnerable the megalopolis was for such unsuspected assaults that left as many as 180 people dead ,and about 200 wounded in the carnage perpetrated by the assailants.Though the intelligent inputs clearly indicated such possible assaults by the terrorists,no preventive steps were taken either by the Center or by the state government which turned pathetically helpless to defend its citizens, and became susceptible to the vitriolic criticism by the people across the country.A few face- saving measures were initiated to pacify the groundswell of peoples' anger.The change of a home minister or the ousting of a chief minister will not absolve the government of the sins of omission or commission unless a foolproof defensive mechanism is in order.India needs to fortify its intelligence wing, and make it much more accountable.The gross failure to warn the Indian leadership of the possible terrorist attacks only leaves wide gaps in the defence of the country.Every citizen needs to be protected since the constitution guarantees the fundamental right to live ,and the present governement has perforce to answer why it has woefully failed to protect its people.\\n\\nBy Dr Karanamrao
== Nigerian Public Policy ==\\n\\nBy: Hannah Viertel, Taylor Stein, and Karli Lutton\\n\\n\\na. Three facts from today's reading\\n\\n1) The reason most Nigerians live in debt is due to Nigeria’s large dependence on oil revenue. Instead of the people benefiting from the oil revenue, the government officials pocket all of the money, leaving their people in poverty. \\n\\n2) Most Nigerians support federalism; they want any power to be shared and they want to be able to contact their government which would in turn create a true democratic rule. Many southerners point out that federalism can only exist if the central government gives some of its power to state and local governments.\\n\\n3) After international oil prices plummeted in the early 1980's, Nigeria was forced to turn to international organizations for help in managing its huge national debt. In 1985, the Babangida regime developed an economic restructural adjustment program with the support of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The program sought to restructure and diversify the Nigerian economy so that it could decrease its dependence on oil.\\n\\n\\nb. Three assumptions from today's reading\\n\\n1) The government of Nigeria operates under a patron-clientelism system in which the military and political elite operate with only their self interest in mind. State control of resources means that those in the pyramid get the spoils and they alone have access to wealth and influence.\\n\\n2) Southerners protested the practice of revenue sharing because they do not trust the government and therefore no one believed that the profits would benefit anyone except corrupt government officials.\\n\\n3) Northerners generally don't support the true federalism movement with regions controlling their own resources because their regions historically have not had as many resources or as much revenue to share.  Many northern states benefit more than southerners from nationally sponsored redistribution programs.\\n\\n\\nc. Three unanswered questions from today's reading\\n\\n1) Will Nigeria be able to remain together as a nation despite their lack of a coherent national identity?\\n\\n2) Will Nigeria ever be able to diversify its economy and not rely solely on oil?\\n\\n3) Is it possible for Nigeria to change from its system of patron-clientelism to establish a true democracy?
Latinos Untapped Resources for the Republican Party\\n\\n\\nMigrating from Puerto Rico to the United States and brought on a military culture,  Juan del Pueblo (called J.D.P. from herein),  began searching for his political roots in a new and exciting culture full of life, challenges and an impressive melting pot growing as fast as anyone predicted. \\n\\n\\nJ.D.P. grew up in a mostly conservative family where poverty and moral values permeated in every aspect of his family, community, and behavior. God was and is the center of the Universe constantly peaking over your shoulders. Throughout a family patriarch and matriarch inspired by Divine Intervention, life commitment, religion, education and conformism became and is in most part the engine that runs a great majority of the Latino Culture.   \\n\\nWhether migrating from North, South or Central America Latinos besides a common language share another building block essential for survival; Conservatism!\\n\\nJ.D.D. after converging into the American Culture, realized that Republicans shared a common philosophy in its pursuit of conserving society by embedding moral values into Americas economy, political, and social tenets.  \\n\\nThe Republican Party is not exploiting its grass root common bond with the Latino Community. Contrary to popular believes, certain extreme elements of the right are scaring and unchallengeable denying Latinos the opportunity to grow within the Party. It is time to wake-up, let us embrace Latinos in what are rightfully theirs, Conservatism, moral values, and the opportunity to shape America into the next century!
\\n<gallery>\\nImage:Example.jpg|Caption1\\nImage:Example.jpg|Caption2\\n</gallery>\\nSurface geology\\n \\nGlobal view of the surfaceMain article: Geology of Venus\\nMuch of Venus's surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity. Overall, Venus has several times as many volcanoes as Earth, and it possesses some 167 giant volcanoes that are over 100 km across. The only volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii.[20] However, this is not because Venus is more volcanically active than Earth, but because its crust is older. Earth's oceanic crust is continually recycled by subduction at the boundaries of tectonic plates, and has an average age of about 100 million years,[26] while Venus's surface is estimated to be about 500 million years old.[20]\\n\\nSeveral lines of evidence point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. During the Soviet Venera program, the Venera 11 and Venera 12 probes detected a constant stream of lightning, and Venera 12 recorded a powerful clap of thunder soon after it landed. The European Space Agency's Venus Express recorded abundant lightning in the high atmosphere.[27] While rainfall drives thunderstorms on Earth, there is no rainfall on the surface of Venus (though it does rain sulfuric acid in the upper atmosphere that evaporates around 25 km above the surface). One possibility is that ash from a volcanic eruption was generating the lightning. Another piece of evidence comes from measurements of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which were found to drop by a factor of 10 between 1978 and 1986. This may imply that the levels had earlier been boosted by a large volcanic eruption.[28]\\n\\n \\nImpact craters on the surface of Venus (image reconstructed from radar data)There are almost a thousand impact craters on Venus, more or less evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as the Earth and the Moon, craters show a range of states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, while on Earth, it is caused by wind and rain erosion. However, on Venus, about 85% of craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters together with their well-preserved condition indicates that the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago,[12] followed by a decay in volcanism.[29] Earth's crust is in continuous motion, but it is thought that Venus cannot sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100 million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.[20]\\n\\nVenusian craters range from 3 km to 280 km in diameter. There are no craters smaller than 3 km, because of the effects of the dense atmosphere on incoming objects. Objects with less than a certain kinetic energy are slowed down so much by the atmosphere that they do not create an impact crater.[30] Incoming projectiles less than 50 meters in diameter will fragment and burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground.[31]
Hydrogen chloride, also known under the name HCl, is a highly corrosive and toxic colorless gas that forms white fumes on contact with humidity. These fumes consist of hydrochloric acid which forms when hydrogen chloride dissolves in water. Hydrogen chloride gas as well as hydrochloric acid are important chemicals in chemistry, science, technology, and industry. The name HCl often refers somewhat misleadingly to hydrochloric acid instead of the gaseous hydrogen chloride.\\n\\nHydrogen chloride forms corrosive hydrochloric acid on contact with body tissue. Inhalation of the fumes can cause coughing, choking, inflammation of the nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract, and in severe cases, pulmonary edema, circulatory system failure, and death. Skin contact can cause redness, pain, and severe skin burns. Hydrogen chloride may cause severe burns to the eye and permanent eye damage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a telescope in orbit around the Earth, named after astronomer Edwin Hubble for his discovery of galaxies outside the Milky Way and his creation of Hubble's Law, which calculates the rate at which the universe is expanding. Its position outside the Earth's atmosphere allows it to take sharp optical images of very faint objects, and since its launch in 1990, it has become one of the most important instruments in the history of astronomy. It has been responsible for many ground-breaking observations and has helped astronomers achieve a better understanding of many fundamental problems in astrophysics. Hubble's Ultra Deep Field is the deepest (most sensitive) astronomical optical image ever taken.\\nMeanings and types of eugenics\\nThe word eugenics etymologically derives from the Greek word eus (good or well) and the suffix -genēs (born), and was coined by Francis Galton in 1883.\\n\\nEugenics has, from the very beginning, meant many different things to many different people. Historically, the term has referred to everything from prenatal care for mothers to forced sterilization and euthanasia. Much debate took place in the past, and takes place today, as to what exactly counts as eugenics.[3] Some types of eugenics, such as race-based eugenics and class-based eugenics, are sometimes called 'pseudo-eugenics' by proponents of strict eugenics that deals only with beneficial and detrimental intrinsic traits.\\n\\nThe term eugenics is often used to refer to movements and social policies that were influential during the early 20th century. In a historical and broader sense, eugenics can also be a study of "improving human genetic qualities". It is sometimes broadly applied to describe any human action whose goal is to improve the gene pool. Some forms of infanticide in ancient societies, present-day reprogenetics, preemptive abortions and designer babies have been (sometimes controversially) referred to as eugenic.\\n\\nBecause of its normative goals and historical association with scientific racism, as well as the development of the science of genetics, the western scientific community has mostly disassociated itself from the term "eugenics", although one can find advocates of what is now known as liberal eugenics. Ideological social determinists, some of which have obtained college degrees in fields relevant to eugenics, often describe eugenics as a pseudoscience. Modern inquiries into the potential use of genetic engineering have led to an increased invocation of the history of eugenics in discussions of bioethics, most often as a cautionary tale. Some ethicists suggest that even non-coercive eugenics programs would be inherently unethical, though this view has been challenged by such thinkers as Nicholas Agar.[4]\\n\\nEugenicists advocate specific policies that (if successful) would lead to a perceived improvement of the human gene pool. Since defining what improvements are desired or beneficial is perceived by many as a cultural choice rather than a matter that can be determined objectively (e.g., by empirical, scientific inquiry), eugenics has often been deemed a pseudoscience. The most disputed aspect of eugenics has been the definition of "improvement" of the human gene pool, such as what is a beneficial characteristic and what is a defect. This aspect of eugenics has historically been tainted with scientific racism.\\n\\nEarly eugenicists were mostly concerned with perceived intelligence factors that often correlated strongly with social class. Many eugenicists took inspiration from the selective breeding of animals (where purebreds are often strived for) as their analogy for improving human society. The mixing of races (or miscegenation) was usually considered as something to be avoided in the name of racial purity. At the time this concept appeared to have some scientific support, and it remained a contentious issue until the advanced development of genetics led to a scientific consensus that the division of the human species into unequal races is unjustifiable. Some see this as an ideological consensus, since equality, just like inequality, is a cultural choice rather than a matter that can be determined objectively.\\n\\nEugenics has also been concerned with the elimination of hereditary diseases such as haemophilia and Huntington's disease. However, there are several problems with labeling certain factors as "genetic defects":\\n\\nIn many cases there is no scientific consensus on what a "genetic defect" is. It is often argued that this is more a matter of social or individual choice. \\nWhat appears to be a "genetic defect" in one context or environment may not be so in another. This can be the case for genes with a heterozygote advantage, such as sickle cell anemia or Tay-Sachs disease, which in their heterozygote form may offer an advantage against, respectively, malaria and tuberculosis. \\nAlthough some birth defects are uniformly lethal, disabled persons can succeed in life. \\nMany of the conditions early eugenicists identified as inheritable (pellagra is one such example) are currently considered to be at least partially, if not wholly, attributed to environmental conditions. \\nSimilar concerns have been raised when a prenatal diagnosis of a congenital disorder leads to abortion (see also preimplantation genetic diagnosis).\\n\\nEugenic policies have been conceptually divided into two categories: positive eugenics, which encourage a designated "most fit" to reproduce more often; and negative eugenics, which discourage or prevent a designated "less fit" from reproducing. Negative eugenics need not be coercive: a state might offer financial rewards to certain people who submit to sterilization, although some critics might reply that this incentive along with social pressure could be perceived as coercion. Positive eugenics can also be coercive. Abortion by "fit" women was illegal in Nazi Germany, and William Shirer (in The Decline and Fall of the Third Reich) mentioned unsubstantiated reports that Aryan women unwilling to become pregnant were often forced into pregnancy through state-supported rape.\\n\\nDuring the 20th century, many countries enacted various eugenics policies and programs, including:\\n\\nGenetic screening \\nBirth control \\nPromoting differential birth rates \\nMarriage restrictions \\nImmigration control \\nSegregation (both racial segregation as well as segregation of the mentally ill from the normal) \\nCompulsory sterilization \\nForced abortions, or, conversely, forced pregnancies \\nGenocide \\nMost of these policies were later regarded as coercive, restrictive, or genocidal, and now few jurisdictions implement policies that are explicitly labeled as eugenic or unequivocally eugenic in substance (however labeled). However, some private organizations assist people in genetic counseling, and reprogenetics may be considered as a form of non-state-enforced "liberal" eugenics.\\n\\nThere are 3 main ways by which the methods of eugenics can be applied. They are:\\n\\nmandatory eugenics, in which the government mandates a eugenics program. \\npromotional voluntary eugenics, in which eugenics is voluntarily practiced and promoted to the general population, but not officially mandated. \\nprivate eugenics, which is practiced voluntarily by individuals and groups, but not promoted to the general population. \\nThere are also different goals of eugenics.[5] They are:\\n\\nintrinsic eugenics, which seeks to exclusively improve a person's genetic traits that are intrinsically beneficial or detrimental to them, such as physical health, mental health, attractiveness, reproductive ability, physical aptitude, intelligence, and self-control \\nracial eugenics, which emphasizes selectively breeding a specific race or races \\nextrinsic social eugenics, which selectively breeds people that have high social status and the genetic traits thereof, such as wealth, attendance at popular colleges, college degrees, popularity, extroversion, personality, and humour
Article Proposal\\n\\nI propose to create an article on “Social Determinants of Health in Poverty” for several reasons: \\n\\n1.	There exists a problem: Within the United States, and across the globe, there exists massive differentials in health outcomes between disadvantaged individuals and the rest of the population, and these health outcomes can be determined based on social factors specific to impoverished populations. Research supports that there exists these differentials. \\n2.	Its importance: Differences in health attributable to different factors such as health care, access to the social safety net, and access to nutritional foods can ensnare the impoverished in the cycle of poverty, disadvantaging many people in society. Poverty traps easily arise from the condition of poor health as people cannot provide themselves with proper care to properly treat their illness, disadvantaging their lives and society. Health is a basic human right that ensures a life where individuals can maximize their capabilities, and understanding the causes of the differences between health will help create policies that solve the underlying causes. Such importance will be reduced to clearly cited factual information within the Wikipedia article itself, with nearly all of this material stated and cited. \\n3.	Lack of awareness: Very few people realize how devastatingly enormous differentials in health care and health outcomes are between privileged and disadvantaged populations, across the globe and within one population. The general public does not recognize the immense ramifications of prevalent injustices in healthcare and social safety nets within one country, and comparatively between different regions of the world. Readers should recognize the social determinants of health within impoverished populations that have different dynamics than the rest of the population. \\n4.	Providing solutions: Health, health care, and access to these provisions represents one of the most prominent debates currently, and has been of vital importance over the past decades to the United States, governments across the globe, and non-profit organizations seeking to understand and improve the health of people. Understanding health, health differentials, differences in these outcomes, as well as access to health care and obstacles embedded in society provides an educated view that builds the foundation for making policy decisions that influence the health and well-being of our nation.\\n\\nI opt to create a new page rather than edit the existing page [[social determinants of health]] for the following reasons: \\n\\n1.	That article has many tags for subpar content, including having multiple issues, being written like a personal reflection or essay rather than an encyclopedic description of the subject, disputed neutrality, a slanted tone, and the perspective provided deals primarily with Canada and does not represent a world view.\\n2.	This article does not provide a specific approach to how poverty, low income, or low socioeconomic status greatly affects the health of people, and how even with those in poverty there is great disparity between health outcomes. Neglect of this fact provides readers with a limited scope of just how divisively health care disparities cut society, even within similar income classes within a country and across the world. \\n3.	Finally, structural causes inherent in society are not clearly represented, and need to be to provide a clear picture to the public of how structural institutions and policy provide these health differentials between different groups of people, even within the lives of the impoverished. \\n\\nIntroduction: \\n\\nThis article will focus on social determinants of health outcomes in impoverished communities by focusing on the disparities in health and causes of such attributable to gender, socioeconomic status, geographical location, society, developed nation status, and underlying societal causes. I will explain all the statistics of gender differences in health and then address underlying causes including a structural violence aspect of gender differences. Structural violence will be one of many academic paradigms that explains the underlying causes of social characteristics determining health outcomes. Health inequalities among economically disadvantaged people, which have be attributed to poor healthcare, lack of nutrition, lack of resources to maintain healthcare, and the influence of neighborhood, location, education, and other factors on health outcomes. Social determinants discuss not only discrimination but also the fundamental causes of health differentials.  \\n\\nI propose the following preliminary outline: \\nSocial determinants of health in poverty\\n\\na.

Otherwise, there will be a ton of overlap - both potential and future- between the existing article (and the topic of social determinants of health) in general and your specific angle on it, which is looking through a poverty lens.

Unlike other forms of lending, borrowers in this sector tend to be of low income and are often on social benefits. Repayments tend to be on a weekly basis and are collected by an agent. The rate of interest offered by providers of credit in this sector is high, often at £40 or £50 per £100 meaning that operators in this sector often face controversy.\\n\\n'''History'''\\nHome Credit has been around since the nineteenth century - but in a form much different to today. The current form of Home Credit predominantly involves cash loans, whereas in past times drapery and home products were the norm.\\n\\n'''Companies who Provide Home Credit'''\\nThe biggest provider of Home Credit in the UK is [[Provident Financial]] which has over 50% of the market providing credit to 2.4 million customers. The biggest four companies have a 70% market share.
The Indian telecom sector has been growing at an exponential rate – being one of the fastest growing sectors in recent times with over 494.07 million subscribers according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). Wireless telephony is definitely the in thing. Even despite the slowdown 11 to 13 million new subscribers are added every month. And this explosive growth of the sector is matched only by the cutthroat competition among the players. As an industry insider revealed, “This is a high stakes game – one in which no one is willing to become the sucker, and it explains the rampant corruption in it. If any one party loses, it perversely seeks to drag its rivals into the quagmire also.” It is more or less the same story in sectors like defense and mining, which too have high stakes and high returns.\\n\\nBut one thing that is special to the telecom sector is that it is not just growing in size but in its scope as well. Earlier we had just GSM-based services; now there is CDMA too. And to these will shortly be added 3G and WiMax, followed by Long Term Evolution (LTE). None of these can enter till the government gives its nod, and without State involvement and intervention at practically every stage.
== North American Carbon Exchange ==\\n\\nThe [http://www.NoCarbEx.com North American Carbon Exchange NoCarbEx.com] is a voluntary "[[carbon_credit]]" exchange.  NoCarbEx purchases carbon credits from individuals and businesses planting trees to reduce greenhouse gases.  The Exchange bundles the shares of carbon credits and resells them to help businesses offset their carbon footprint. \\n\\n=== Lowering Greenhouse Gases ===\\nRising world levels of CO2 ([[Greenhouse effect]]) from fossil fuel emissions is a major cause of global warming. It is widely accepted that global temperature is increasing because world levels of CO2 are rising. The majority of the CO2 is produced by human activity, specifically by the burning of fossil fuels in power plants, automobiles, and deforestation.\\n\\nLowering these CO2 levels is being addressed by two major approaches. Non-fossil fuel approaches include nuclear, wind, and solar. Removing CO2 from the atmosphere is possible by planting trees. Wood, almost half carbon, provides one of the most commercially viable approaches for sequestering massive amounts of carbon dioxide. The world marketplace has existed since 2004 for carbon sequestration.  The largest US marketplace for voluntary carbon credits is the [[Chicago_Climate_Exchange]].\\n\\n=== Individual Participation in Carbon Credit Trading ===\\nThe North American Carbon Exchange allows individuals to participate in the voluntary carbon markets by providing financial incentives for [[afforestation]]. The Exchange has its own methodology to measure and transparently verify that all carbon dioxide offsets are additional and permanent. The NoCarbEx methodology fully complies or exceeds the principles of all major global warming regulatory regimes (i.e., the [[Kyoto_treaty]], the California Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and most of the draft US Federal Legislation). These principles are:\\n\\nAdditionality. From the perspective of global warming, offsets need to be additional and result in a net decrease of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In other words, the sequestration of greenhouse gases needs to happen in addition to what would happen in the absence of the intervention. \\n\\nLeakage. It is important to ensure that the additional carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere is not emitted elsewhere as a result of the planting of new trees. \\n\\nPermanence. The carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by growing trees needs to become "permanently" sequestered. NoCarbEx participants commit to keep the trees planted for a minimum of 40 years and pay a penalty if the tree is removed before this time. \\n\\nVerification. Every single tree registered with NoCarbEx has a technical data-sheet that is maintained by NoCarbEx showing the type of tree and its expected growth and carbon sequestration potential. All NoCarbEx trees are geo-referenced and can be found easily through Google or other mapping software.\\n\\n==Copyright problems==\\n[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|left|48px|]]Hello.

Globalisation is a term which developed momentum during the 1970's as world relationships increased with the establishment of several organisations, aimed at developing global unity through international trade, the spreading of multiculturalism and the widespread diffusion of technology. Due to the fact that there are many sub-divisions of globalisation, a standard and generally accepted definition has not yet been created as different sectors view globalisation according to their specialty. According to Horst Kohler, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), globalisation is the "process of increasing international divisions of labour and the accompanying integration of national economies through trade in goods and services, cross border cooperate investments and financial flows". However it is also the integration of world culture and society through the "proliferation of communication and information." Increased world relationships, usually controlled by Core Countries, can impact both positively and negatively on developing countries such as the Caribbean where dependant development is practiced.\\n\\nThe process of globalisation can be traced back to the voyages of the Spanish, Dutch and Portugeese during "European maritime and mercantile expansion" in the early 16th century where these explorers traded with overseas nations and developed navigational technologies in an effort to expand trading relationships. Even the Africans and Nordics traded with indigenous North American peoples long before the arrival of the Europeans in the New World, and exercised some degree of cultural influence on the American's way of life, where habits were adopted and languages fused to establish a plane of understanding. The first hints of globalisation for the Caribbean could have begun with colonization where different people of different nationalities and culture were under the same umbrella of society, resulting in increased trade and communications between the Metropolis and the colonies, as well as the start of cultural hegemony which can be considered a negative impact of globalisation.\\n\\nAfter World War 2 with the establishment of the UN, world organisations were formed such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) who assumed its role as the "directing and coordinating authority of international health work" where they aim to attain the "highest possible level of health". Due to the fact that Caribbean countries lack the financial resources to develop their health sector, the WHO assists these countries financially as well as offer external assistance by "training the countries' human resources and strengthening other institutions" so that they will possess the scientific and technical knowledge to combat common disease within the region.\\n\\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) an agency of the U.N. developed as a result of globalisation, also seeks to facilitate the needs of the Caribbean Countries through providing financial assistance to both the public and private sector to develop their economies and achieve a favourable balance of payments. They support the establishment of organisations such as the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC) where they contribute financially to the provision of technical and tax training as well as financial supervisions and public expenditure management for Caribbean countries in need.\\n\\nSince the 1970's onwards, the Caribbean has experienced lower levels of mortality rates through better technologies in the health sector made available by world organisations established as a result of globalisation. Adult Literacy has increased by almost 10% in the Caribbean due to the fact that one of the concepts of globalisation is free trade and a reduction on trade tariffs which enables Caribbean communities to access proper reading materials as well as offer citizens a greater opportunity to be educated outside the Caribbean by promoting international student policies and scholarships. Due to the fact that Globalisation constructs free trade zones, Caribbean islands are able to import goods with reduced import restrictions and custom duties as well as allow the influx of multi national firms which would lead to a greater variety of goods and services, stimulating economic growth and devolopment by an increased national income, GDP as well as increased levels of employment.\\n\\nHowever despite all its attractive advantages, globalisation can be considered the reason for the existence of "poor countries" such as Africa where the slave trade and the "scramble" for Africa in the 1870's (early signs of globalisation) underdeveloped the once prosperous nation, acording to Walter Rodney. Increased social relationships among "distant localities" and neo-liberal policies result in the exploitation of the resources of the Lesser Economically Devoloped Countries (LEDC) as the developed countries practice a form of neocolonisation where they acquire "inexpensive natural resouces from poorer countries" including oil, which contributes to their dependency on the Metropolitan countries, while not raising their standard of living. The US consumes 80% of the world's resources and obtains 40% from other countries such as Latin American and the Caribbean as well as mediterranean nations.\\n\\nGlobalisation also result in cultural and political imperialism. Through increased interaction among nations, governments are able to exercise vasts amounts of political power through "military might and economic influence". Trade and economic connections with foreigh countries have had an adverse effect on the Caribbean since our relationship with the US has heightened their interest in political affairs, where they have taken up the opportunity to intervene whenever their "humanitarian and political interests were being threatened" as with Cuba 1959 and Grenada 1983. Trade has also led to cultural imports of foreign food, music, language and other aspects of European/American way of life which pressure local culture. Due to the fact that Latin America and the Caribbean account for 10% of international television viewing, this constant input of foreign taste threaten unique Caribbean identity through the adoption of traditions, norms and values of Core Countries leading to deculturalisation and conflict with identity which may cause cultural erasure.\\n\\nGlobalisation has many positive effects stemming from increased trade and technologies to global organisations which assist the Caribbean financially in order to develop their economies. However according to Norman Girman, this leads to financial dependency for "government capital" through a one-way preferential trading relationship with Core Countries. It promotes political and cultural hegemony leading to a loss of identity, customs and unique societal traits. Globalisation stimulates the tourism industry of the Caribbean through increased awarness and international visibility via the mass media, however this results in the exploitation of our natural resources such as the coral reefs and beaches as well as the involvement of foreigners in the industry where they establish hotel and businesses, thus returning capital to countris such as Germany, USA and England. Hence the question is globalisation really beneficial to Caribbean communities or is the concept really just in the interest of developed nations?[[User:Krissiebaby1987|Krissiebaby1987]] 23:49, 17 September 2007 (UTC)
The advent of "hybrid showering" systems is rather new. Powerful consumption made possible by a highly automated destruction of vast quantities of hydrocarbons from the Earth, have in a sense over a short time developed a "blind spot" that camouflages the heinous waste of thermal energy, water, and consumables like soap that the contemporary but still extremely primitive bathroom shower system requires to operate.\\n\\n\\nThe practical laws that govern "extreme waste" in contemporary showers was first discovered by Michael Vittorio Collalto who in the period during 1986 and particularly from 1994 onwards set about materializing what has become this worlds first "hybrid shower", that is one of many hybrid showering configurations possible..\\n\\n\\nIt gradually incorporated a research facility, used to test the hypothesis amongst others that the shower seemed to be no better than an efficient "cooling tower", amazingly adverse to the aim of providing a warm or hot environment.\\n\\n\\n(used to cool water in order to improve the efficiency of the refrigeration cycle in larger applications. e.g. commercial buildings.)--[[User:Hybrid Shower|Hybrid Shower]] 09:11, 18 April 2007 (UTC)\\n[[Shower science]]

I would like to introduce myself to the Wiki World, my name is Margaux Kerr. I am an Urban and Regional Planning Major with a focus in two concentrations of Environmental Sciences as well as Recreation and Leisure. The Wiki page I will be contributing and editing is for my senior project in Emergency Management Planning. My group and I are under the "Kings" section and will focus our studies and research on different [[User:Emplanning/Coastal Hazards|Coastal Hazards]] along the North Carolina shoreline, especially the barrier islands which run up and down the coast.  Coastal Communities on barrier islands have been struggling for years with property damage and loss due to the movement of sand, storms and the natural process of the moving barrier islandsThe effects of natural disasters and erosion to the coast have been an area of concern for coastal communities, the vulnerability of structural mitigation is only a short-term solution. Our group will focus on the trial and error of nonstructural mitigation techniques to help reduce the eroding beaches and maintain buffers when a disaster strikes.. The group effort towards research and completion of this page will progress over the next few months. I look forward to creating an accurate source of information via the web with my group members, thanks to the formation of Wiki. \\n\\n[[User:Emplanning/Coastal Hazards|Coastal Hazards]]

{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --> This is all what I larned in my Astrobiology!!hehehe!! (>_<)\\nHi my name is Ashley,but my friends just call me Ash...I have been asking my teacher as my school ''What is Astrobiology?,'' but i never got the correct answers until now. Astrobiology is the study of the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of extraterrestrial life. This interdisciplinary field encompasses the search for habitable environments in our Solar System and habitable planets outside our Solar System, the search for evidence of prebiotic chemistry, laboratory and field research into the origins and early evolution of life on Earth, and studies of the potential for life to adapt to challenges on Earth and in outer space. Astrobiology addresses the question of whether life exists beyond Earth, and how humans can detect it if it does.[2] (The term exobiology is similar but more specific — it covers the search for life beyond Earth, and the effects of extraterrestrial environments on living things.)\\n\\nAstrobiology makes use of physics, chemistry, astronomy, biology, molecular biology, ecology, planetary science, geography, and geology to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize biospheres that might be different from the biosphere on Earth. Astrobiology concerns itself with interpretation of existing scientific data; given more detailed and reliable data from other parts of the universe, the roots of astrobiology itself—physics, chemistry and biology—may have their theoretical bases challenged. Although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories.\\n\\nEarth is the only place in the universe known to harbor life.[6][7] However, recent advances in planetary science have changed fundamental assumptions about the possibility of life in the universe, raising the estimates of habitable zones around other stars and the search for extraterrestrial microbial life.[8] The possibility of life on Mars, either currently or in the past, is an active area of research.\\n\\nNASA’s Astrobiology Program addresses three fundamental questions: How does life begin and evolve? Is there life beyond Earth and, if so, how can we detect it? What is the future of life on Earth and in the universe? In striving to answer these questions and improve understanding of biological, planetary, and cosmic phenomena and relationships among them, experts in astronomy and astrophysics, Earth and planetary sciences, microbiology and evolutionary biology, cosmochemistry, and other relevant disciplines are participating in astrobiology research and helping to advance the enterprise of space exploration.\\n\\nThe Astrobiology Program has four elements: the NASA Astrobiology Institute, Exobiology and Evolutionary Biology, Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets, and Astrobiology Science and Technology Instrument Development. NASA established the Astrobiology Program in 1996. However, NASA studies in the field of exobiology – a predecessor to astrobiology – date back to the beginning of the U.S. space program.\\n\\nNASA funded its first exobiology project in 1959 and established an Exobiology Program in 1960. NASA’s Viking missions to Mars, launched in 1976, included three biology experiments designed to look for possible signs of life. In the 21st century, astrobiology is a focus of a growing number of NASA solar system exploration missions. As noted above, exobiology research is now an element of the Astrobiology Program. (For more information on the history of NASA’s Astrobiology Program, see The Living Universe: NASA and the Development of Astrobiology, by Steven J. Dick and James E. Strick, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, NJ, 2004.)\\n\\nAstrobiology is a cross-cutting theme in all of NASA’s space science endeavors, knitting together research in astrophysics, earth science, and heliophysics as well as planetary science. NASA’s Astrobiology Roadmap, prepared in consultation with the scientific community, outlines multiple pathways for research and exploration and indicates how they might be prioritized and coordinated. The Astrobiology Program also solicits advice from the Space Studies Board of the National Research Council (see publications page).\\n\\nThe Astrobiology Program is managed by the Planetary Science Division of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. Mary Voytek is Senior Scientist for Astrobiology in the Planetary Science Division. The Astrobiology Program is closely coordinated with NASA’s Mars Exploration and Planetary Protection Programs.\\n\\nFocus Areas for Astrobiology\\n\\nInner Solar System - Inner solar system bodies are rocky, unlike the gas and water giant planets of the outer solar system. Rocky planets are thought to have formed from the accretion of dust into “planetesimals,” the planetesimals into proto-planets and finally the proto-planets into planets. Many details of this sequence are still unknown, including the composition of the planetesimals. Equally obscure are the histories of the inner solar system worlds: although Venus, the Earth, and Mars are similar to one another, they have evolved in highly distinct ways. We now know that Mars once had water on its surface, and there are tantalizing hints that Venus might have too. Yet only the Earth is currently known to be habitable. Missions currently in operation, development and planning will greatly increase our knowledge of the forces driving planetary habitability and evolution.\\n\\n    Jupiter's moon EuropaFalse color composite of the Minos Linea region on Jupiter's moon Europa. \\n\\nOuter Solar System - The giant planets of the outer solar system—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—and their rings and moons and the ice dwarfs (e.g., Pluto, Charon, Sedna) beyond them hold many clues to the origin and evolution of our solar system as well as providing exciting opportunities for the search for habitable environments. Moreover, an understanding of the formation and dynamics of the giant planets will aid greatly in understanding the nature of extra-solar planetary systems.\\n\\nSmall Bodies of the Solar System - The small bodies in the solar system include comets, asteroids, the objects in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort cloud, small planetary satellites, Triton, Pluto, Charon, and interplanetary dust. As some of these objects are believed to be minimally altered from their state in the young solar nebula from which the planets formed, overall they may provide a window into the early history of the solar system through which insights about the process of planet formation may be drawn.\\nAstrobiology in Space Exploration Missions \\nAstrobiology is a cross-cutting theme in all of NASA’s space science endeavors, knitting together research in astrophysics, earth science, and heliophysics as well as planetary science. NASA’s Astrobiology Roadmap, prepared in consultation with the scientific community, outlines multiple possible pathways for research and exploration. The Astrobiology Program already plays a role in many of NASA’s solar system exploration initiatives, and astrobiology is a primary focus of a growing number of upcoming exploration missions.\\n\\nFor example, Phoenix Mars polar-lander mission, launched in August 2007, is designed to conduct in-situ sampling and analysis of Martian surface and subsurface soil and ice. The science objectives of the Phoenix Mars mission are to study the history of water on Mars in all of its phases, search for evidence of habitable zones on Mars and assess the potential for life in the ice-soil boundary of the Martian arctic region. A primary goal of NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory mission planned for launch in 2009 is to determine whether life ever arose on Mars. The Astrobiology Science Laboratory mission proposed as a successor to MSL will be dedicated to astrobiology research on Mars. Astrobiology will play a prominent role in a Mars Sample Return mission as well.\\n\\nThe ASTEP Program sponsors terrestrial field testing of instruments and equipment being developed for MSL and other future planetary missions. The ASTID Program supports the development of instruments for future missions as well. For instance, ASTID funding contributed to the development of the Urey Mars Organic and Oxidant Detector for the European Space Agency’s ExoMars mission. Concepts under consideration for missions to Jupiter’s moon Europa also feature astrobiological investigations.\\n\\nAt the same time that astrobiology plays a key role in many solar system exploration missions, astrobiologists also make extensive use of data produced by other space science projects to study topics such as prebiotic chemistry in interstellar space, the formation of habitable planets, and extraterrestrial environments where prebiotic chemistry or life may have occurred. These projects include the Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer Space Telescope, and ground-based telescopes around the world at facilities such as the Keck Observatory.\\n\\nThe Astrobiology Program is managed by the Planetary Science Division of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. The Astrobiology Program is closely coordinated with NASA’s Mars Exploration and Planetary Protection Programs.\\n\\nBuilding the Tools for Astrobiology's Future\\n\\nThe NASA Astrobiology program has selected eight new projects for funding under the Astrobiology Science and Technology for Instrument Development Program (ASTID). The ASTID program is an essential component in furthering NASA's astrobiology goals, and provides funding for new instruments that can be used in space missions as well as Earth-based research projects.\\n\\nASTID projects turn novel concepts into laboratory instruments that will open new areas of study and the development of astrobiology mission concepts and payloads for future missions.\\n\\nFunding from the ASTID program has provided technologies like the Urey Mars Organic and Oxidant Detector for Europe's ExoMars mission, and the Magneto-Optical Phase Enantiomeric Detector (MOPED), which could help in the search for life beyond Earth by detecting chiral biomarkers. A recent addition to the ASTID program is the development of small astrobiology payloads that can fly on small satellites and lunar missions.\\n\\nThese suitcase-sized payloads include missions like the recent O/OREOS satellite in Earth orbit, and can provide significant science return on a relatively small investment.
Energy efficiency and boiler operation.\\nAll combustion requires the correct measure of oxygen; too much or too little can cause undesirable effects. However, the error is almost always intentionally on the high-side (too much oxygen) because the main effect on the high side is low efficiency. Too little air results in carbon monoxide formation, sooting and even explosion if accumulated soot and other non-combusted suddenly get enough oxygen to rapidly burn.\\n\\nWhen boiler burners are manually tuned on a periodic basis, they are typically adjusted to about 3% excess oxygen which is about 15% excess air. This is because there are many ambient and atmospheric conditions that can affect oxygen/air supply. For example, colder air is denser and contains more oxygen than warm air; wind speed affects every chimney/flue/stack differently; and barometric pressure further affects draft. See Air Temp and Pressure. Therefore, an excess oxygen/air setting at the time of tuning assumes there will still be enough oxygen available for complete combustion when conditions worsen.\\n\\nFrom an efficiency standpoint, the excess O2 means there is more air in the combustion stream than there needs to be. That air also contains moisture, and it all is heated and then lost up the stack. The amount of excess O2 is about directly proportional to the efficiency lost; that is, 3% excess O2 means 3% efficiency drop.\\n\\nAlthough it may be possible to monitor and adjust the burner on a daily basis, it is not practical. Automatic O2 systems continuously monitor the flue gases and adjust the burner air supply. They are generically called 'O2 Trim Systems'.There are laws that soon may be mandated to make these systems mandatory on boilers over 200 horsepower.

The idea is that the more confident people feel about the economy and their jobs and incomes, the more likely they are to make purchases. Declining consumer confidence is a sign of slowing economic growth and may indicate that the economy is headed into trouble.\\n\\n== Usage ==\\nManufacturers, retailers, banks and the government monitor changes in the CCI in order to factor in the data in their decision-making processes. While index changes of less than 5% are often dismissed as inconsequential, moves of 5% or more often indicate a change in the direction of the economy.\\n\\nA month-on-month decreasing trend suggests consumers have a negative outlook on their ability to secure and retain good jobs. Thus, manufacturers may expect consumers to avoid retail purchases, particularly large-ticket items that require financing. Manufacturers may pare down inventories to reduce overhead or delay investing in new projects and facilities. Likewise, banks can anticipate a decrease in lending activity, mortgage applications and credit card use. When faced with a down-trending index, the government has a variety of options, such as issuing a tax rebate or taking other fiscal or monetary action to stimulate the economy.\\n\\nConversely, a rising trend in consumer confidence indicates improvements in consumer buying patterns. Manufacturers can increase production and hiring. Banks can expect increased demand for credit. Builders can prepare for a rise in home construction, and government can anticipate improved tax revenues based on the increase in [[consumer spending]].\\n\\n== Consumer-demand surveys versus consumer-confidence and -sentiment surveys ==\\nConsumer-demand surveys are interview-based statistical surveys that measure the percentage of households that will buy a car, white goods, PCs, TVs, home furnishings, kitchenware, or toys in, for example, the next three-month period. The surveys provide a percentage of those who will purchase more, less, or the same amount of food and clothing in the next three months than in the corresponding period the year before. If you ask people about their purchasing behavior within the coming six or 12 months, there will be more of those who "hope to be able to buy", than if consumers are asked about what they will purchase in the next three months. The shorter the time spans, the closer to actual behavior.\\n\\nConsumer confidence and sentiment surveys measure how people are doing financially, how they look at the overall economy of the country or business conditions in the country, if they think that the government is doing a good or a poor job and if people think that it is a good or a bad time to buy a car or to buy or sell a house.\\n\\nWhen the business cycle is fairly stable, consumer demand surveys and consumer confidence and sentiment indices will often correlate closely and indicate the same direction of the economy, but in times with a high degree of economic or political uncertainty or during a prolonged crisis, the two types of consumer surveys might differ significantly. In 2011, confidence and sentiment surveys went up from March to April, while consumer demand surveys dropped significantly. In August 2011, the confidence and sentiment surveys dropped significantly and stayed low during September and October, while consumer demand surveys showed resilience, a development confirmed later by official statistics.\\n\\nA 2022 study found that the consumer confidence index always plays a positive and statistically significant function in the development of consumption.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chemistry |first=University of |last2=Prague |first2=Technology |title=Happy people spend less on consumption, study suggests |url=https://phys.org/news/2022-12-happy-people-consumption.html |access-date=2022-12-26 |website=phys.org |language=en}}</ref>\\n\\n== In Canada ==\\n[[Conference Board of Canada|The Conference Board of Canada's]] index of consumer confidence has been ongoing since 1980. It is constructed from responses to four attitudinal questions posed to a random sample of Canadian households. Those surveyed are asked to give their views about their households' current and expected financial positions and the short-term employment outlook. They are also asked to assess whether now is a good or a bad time to make a major purchase, such as a house, car or other big-ticket items.\\n\\n== In Indonesia ==\\nConsumer Survey-Bank Indonesia (CS-BI) is a monthly survey that has been conducted since October 1999 by [[Bank Indonesia]].<ref name="OECD-INDO-CCI">{{cite web\\n  | url = http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/22/30/43813366.pdf\\n  | title = BANK INDONESIA – CONSUMER SURVEY\\n  | publisher = Bank Indonesia\\n  | author1 = Nurcahyo Heru Prasetyo | author2 = Ririn Yuliatiningsih\\n  | access-date = 2011-02-26\\n}}</ref> The survey represents the consumer confidence about the overall economic condition, general price level, household income, and consumption plans three and six months ahead.

At a [[significance level]] of 99%, the survey has a [[sampling error]] of 2%. Data canvassing run through interviews by phone and direct visits in particular cities that is based on rotational system. The Balance Score Method (net balance + 100) has been adopted to construct the index, where the index above 100 points indicates optimism (positive responses) and vice versa.

The preliminary results from the consumer confidence survey are released on the last Tuesday of each month at 10am EST.\\n\\nOnce the data have been gathered, a proportion known as the "relative value" is calculated for each question separately. Each question's positive responses are divided by the sum of its positive and negative responses. The relative value for each question is then compared against each relative value from 1985. This comparison of the relative values results in an "index value" for each question.\\n\\nThe index values for all five questions are then averaged together to form the consumer confidence index; the average of index values for questions one and three form the present situation index, and the average of index values for questions two, four and five form the expectations index.

This disorder is classified in the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) as an anxiety disorder that is developed after experiencing an interpersonal traumatic event that engages threat of injury or death.  These circumstances are usually involved with events such as physical or sexual assault, active engagement in war, situations of terrorism, and natural disasters.  \\nEveryday life brings about a variety of experiences that trigger certain human emotions.  These emotions can range from a feeling of happiness, sadness, anger, and fear.  A specific human emotion felt by all people in a variety of situations is anxiety.  It is not uncommon for situations including a student right before a test, a person struggling with a problem at work, or someone making an import decision to feel anxious, nervous, or overwhelmed.\\n	It is when anxiety begins to take over one’s life and control of their mental well-being and dramatically affect their over all mood when it becomes a psychological problem.  Anxiety disorders are one of the most commonly diagnosed psychological disorders (Ruscio, Chiu, Roy-Byrne, Stang, Stein, Wittchen & Kessler, 2006).  There are many kinds of anxiety disorders that consist of panic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, a variety of phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder.  Posttraumatic stress disorder is one of the most discussed of these disorders due to its high frequency of occurrence and unique symptoms.\\n“Such events often include either experiencing or witnessing a severe accident or physical injury, receiving a life-threatening medical diagnosis, being the victim of kidnapping or torture, exposure to war combat or to a natural disaster, exposure to other disaster (for example, plane crash) or terrorist attack, being the victim of rape, mugging, robbery, or assault, enduring physical, sexual, emotional, or other forms of abuse, as well as involvement in civil conflict.” (Yehuda, 2002)\\n\\nRisk Factor\\n 	Certain factors increase the likelihood of developing posttraumatic stress disorder after the incident.  The first of these is the severity and duration of the event (Lilly & Valdez, 2012).  For example, a veteran who spent months over seas experiencing the horrific life threatening events of war will have a greater chance of developing PTSD than someone who was in a single car accident.  Another factor that increases the chance of developing PTSD is having a weak social support (Jakupcak, Vannoy, Imel, 2010).  This system would be primarily composed of family members and friends.  People of poverty stricken areas who have been diagnosed with the disorder have been linked to this cause from lack of a strong support system (Chen, Keith, 2007).\\n\\nSymptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\\n	Posttraumatic stress disorder has a range of effects.  These effects include physical, psychological, and social factors that negatively affect the patient’s daily life and activities.  One of the most common symptoms seen in patients suffering from PTSD is the act of “reliving” the traumatic event (Yehuda, 2002).  For example, a war veteran who personally experienced intense and violent warfare will have repeated flashback episodes of being back in battle.  This veteran will suffer from all the intense and negative emotions that come with combat while sitting safely in their own home.  Patients will also suffer from upsetting nightmares and have strong, damaging reactions to common situations that remind them of their traumatic event.\\n	Another common symptom of people suffering from PTSD is the act of avoidance.  Under this symptom, patients feel detached from social situations and have a feeling as though not to care about anything.  This is commonly referred to as emotional “numbing”.  Due to patients having negative reactions to situations that remind them of the traumatic event, they will avoid people, places, and thoughts that remind them of such event (Yehuda, 2002).\\n\\nImpairments in Brain Functioning	\\nPosttraumatic stress disorder has an affect of certain portions and structures of the brain.  Three of the most impacted of these structures are the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the hippocampus.  The prefrontal cortex is the portion of the brain that is associated with the act of planning and formulating strategies (Yehuda, 2002).  Patients suffering from PTSD have a reduced responsiveness within this structure.  The next structure that is impacted is the amygdala, which is a temporal lobe involved in the assessment of stimuli related to threatening situations and plays a vital role in the development of fear conditioning.  The amygdala and prefrontal cortex work together in a negative feedback relationship.  When a patient is suffering from PTSD this feedback situation is negatively impacted and unbalanced.  This causes the amygdala to be hyper-responsive, which leads to ambiguous stimuli to more frequently be seen as threatening (Yehuda, 2002).  When more stimuli are observed as threatening there is a high increase in the patients stress levels, which only sparks more ambiguous stimuli to be viewed as threatening.  It becomes a violent spiral in which the patient always loses.  \\nThe last brain structure that is affected by PTSD is the hippocampus.  This structure is also part of the medial temporal lobe and is involved in memory and the processes surrounding it.  Increased levels of arousal as a result of stressors and high level of stress hormones lower hippocampal functioning.  This leads to lower levels of long-term potentiation, which decreases the amount of strengthening of nerve cells and their synapses.  All of this leads to memory impairment and decreased cognitive functioning (Yehuda, 2002).\\n\\nAttention and Inhibition Impairment Associated with PTSD\\n	Emotional impairment due to improper functioning of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala and memory impairment from improper hippocampus functioning aren’t the only two cognitive features affected by the disorder.  Attention and inhibition are also affected by posttraumatic stress disorder.  Soldiers recently returning from overseas that are diagnosed with PTSD do not immediately show signs of this decrease in attention.  It is not until one year or more that these symptoms start to appear.  This is due to the build up of negative experiences associated with PTSD over a prolonged period of time; these experiences include frequent flashbacks and nightmares of the horrific event.  As time goes by these stressors on the neurological system cause neurobiological alterations, affecting the noradrenergetic and neuroendocrine systems.  As a result, there is a damaging effect on attention and learning (Yehuda, 2002).\\n	The negative affects that PTSD has on cognitive functions can have a serious impact on an individual’s daily life and normal functioning.  These impacts initially depend on age range.   Soldiers, who have recently returned from the Iraq or Afghanistan war, will feel affects such as brief gaps in short term memory and mild disabilities in attention tasks.  Veterans from wars included Vietnam or people who have suffered from PTSD symptoms for an extended period of time will feel more extreme effects.  These include extreme memory loss from specific anxiety ridden situations, significant emotional changes towards loved ones and close friends, and attention difficulties in various tasks.\\n	Posttraumatic stress disorder will continue to be one of the most discussed and feared of the range of anxiety disorders.  The effects of posttraumatic stress disorder can have an assortment of negative impacts on cognitive functions of the patients.  These effects vary from emotion, memory, and attention difficulties as a result of the malfunctioning of portions and structures in the brain, as well as the general suffering from the disorder.  Anxiety disorders will not simply disappear one day, their effects will continues to expand and cause negative impacts on peoples lives all over the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRefrences:\\n\\nChen, A.

{{underconstruction}}\\n\\n== Introduction ==\\nStudies carried out in several countries have shown that many species of bacteria, plants and animals can survive in a viable form in the ballast water and sediment carried in ships, even after journeys of several weeks duration.  Subsequent discharge of ballast water or sediment into the waters of port states may result in the establishment of colonies of harmful species and pathogens which can seriously upset the existing ecological balance.  Although other methods have been identified by which organisms are transferred between geographically separated sea areas, ballast water discharge from ships appears to have been prominent among those identified.\\n\\nThe potential for ballast water discharge to cause harm has been recognised not only by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), but also by the World Health Organization which is concerned about the role of ballast water as a medium for the spreading of epidemic disease bacteria.\\n\\n== Requirements ==\\nSome countries have established controls on the discharge of ships’ ballast water that will minimise the potential for colonisation of their rivers and estuaries by non native species.  The preferred option is mid-ocean ballast water exchange prior to arrival.  Accordingly, the countries most concerned have promulgated advice to ships for ballast management, together with a request for their co-operation in applying the techniques voluntarily.  Standard procedures have been developed that will be accepted by quarantine authorities as achieving the level of acceptability desired by the port state.\\n\\n== Conflict with Safety ==\\nUnless applied carefully some of the measures being urged for ballast management can affect a ship’s safety, either by creating forces within the hull that are greater than the design parameters, or by compromising the stability of the ship.  \\n\\nIt is because of concern about this that the IMO became involved in what would otherwise be a purely quarantine matter.  It has been recognised by governments and the shipping industry that individual countries’ needs should be harmonised with the greater need to ensure the safety of ships, their crews and passengers.\\n\\nIMO recommends that each ship should be provided with a Ballast Water Management Plan, detailing the way that the ship can comply with any measures demanded by a port state.  Once it has been established that the management of ballast is necessary to meet the quarantine requirements of a port state, preparation for it should be treated with the same seriousness as preparation of a cargo plan.   All concerned with the operation and safe passage of the ship can thereby be assured that they are both protecting the marine environment and ensuring the safety of the ship and crew.\\n\\n== Summary of records required ==\\nTo be able to demonstrate at the arrival port that the correct measures have been completed, it will be necessary to maintain a full and accurate ballast log. Even if a ship is not trading in an area where ballast water information is required, it may later prove worthwhile to have a history of what water has been carried.\\n\\n== Reporting to port states ==\\nSeveral countries have become aware of the potential, through discharge of ships’ ballast water, for the transfer into their coastal areas of what are found to be harmful aquatic organisms.   Governments have recognised that, before devising mandatory controls on ships, it is necessary to know the scale of what has, until very recently, been an unrecorded procedure.\\n\\nConcerned countries have therefore introduced a requirement which, though often differing in detail, generally calls for ships to report in advance, to the national monitoring authority, how much ballast water will be on board on arrival, where it was taken on board, and whether a ballast management procedure has been followed.   In most cases it is mandatory to make the report, even though the actual ballast exchange in mid-ocean (or other management procedure) remains voluntary.\\n\\n{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" align="center" style="width:70%; border:2px #a3b1bf solid; background:#ffbbbb; text-align:center;"\\n|== CAUTION ==\\nThe function of the Ballast Water Management Plan is to assist in complying with quarantine measures intended to minimise the risk of transplanting harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens from ship’s ballast water and associated sediments, while maintaining ship safety.\\nAs part of this function the plan will provide information to quarantine officers who wish to learn about a ship’s ballast handling system, or to confirm that ballast management has been effectively planned.\\nThe plan should not be used or regarded as a guide to ballasting. Training and shipboard operational practices have to be well established and all safety aspects detailed. Untrained handling of ballast water can lead to sinking and loss of life and cargo.\\n|}\\n\\n[[File:Example.jpg]]<!-- Comment -->\\n{| class="wikitable" border="1"\\n|-\\n! header 1\\n! header 2\\n! header 3\\n|-\\n| row 1, cell 1\\n| row 1, cell 2\\n| row 1, cell 3\\n|-\\n| row 2, cell 1\\n| row 2, cell 2\\n| row 2, cell 3\\n|}
Most of the poor science on these pages comes from the MAJOR misconception that diffusion is dependent on concentration gradients, mostly from bad teaching in years 7-12  of high-school biology classes! Most of this argument was clarified in 1970's by the UK Nuffield Science Project, where diffusion was, correctly, defined as RANDOM MOVEMENT of MOLECULES (particles) owing to their kinetic energy. Hence diffusion occurs all the time unless the temperature reaches 0*K.\\n\\n A concentration gradient has the effect of generating NET diffusion from the area/volume having a higher concentration of the molecules under consideration to the volume with fewer of them. However when all of the different molecular species (particles) are evenly distributed, diffusion continues with on average equal movements of all species in all directions, now however there is no NET diffusion. In living systems (and probably in some non-living artificial systems), various carriers may pick up and bind certain molecules, hence the system can maintain the concentration gradient, so NET diffusion continues "down", or as I prefer "along" the concentration gradient.\\n\\nWhy Oh why can't we teach proper science instead of a dumbed down version that leads to all of the half understood writings here? It leads to misconceptions of osmosis, and, since we now know  that living membranes are much more complex than we first believed, we need to teach correct science not a convenient but wrongly conceptualised version.
== Haussecker Institute for African Development ==\\n\\n== Founder ==\\nThe "Haussecker Institute for African Development" was founded by Tristan Haussecker in December of 2008. Tristan, an undergraduate [[African Studies]] major, decided to begin working on establishing an organization that would research and advocate developmental policy in rural African countries. He began his research in late 2007 uncovering facts and statistics of the Rwandan and Congolese mineral exports, educational systems, political parties, and military power. He then went on to expand his research by investigating other African countries with too many conflicts to reach their maximum economic and agricultural potential. Upon his graduation he plans to further his research in Africa before pursuing a M.A. or P.h.d in a related field.\\n\\n== Structure ==\\nThis Institute has been broken down into three main areas of research. Economic Growth, Educational Development, and Political Stabilization are the main reasons that many countries thrive. Due to the insufficient development of these key aspects in many African countries, the "Haussecker Institute" strives to research possible solutions to these problems.
'''Power optimization''' is the use of electronic design automation tools to optimize (reduce) the power consumption of a digital design, such as that of an integrated circuit, while preserving the functionality.\\n\\n==Introduction and history==\\n\\nThe increasing speed and complexity of today’s designs implies a significant increase in the power consumption of [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) [[integrated circuit|chip]]s. To meet this challenge, researchers have developed many different design techniques to reduce power. The complexity of today’s ICs, with over 100 million\\ntransistors, clocked at over 1&nbsp;GHz, means manual power optimization would be hopelessly slow and all too likely to contain errors.  Computer-aided design (CAD) tools and methodologies are mandatory.\\n\\nOne of the key features that led to the success of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, or [[CMOS]],  technology was its intrinsic low-power consumption. This meant that circuit designers and electronic design automation (EDA) tools could afford to concentrate on maximizing circuit performance and minimizing circuit area. Another interesting feature of CMOS technology is its nice scaling properties, which has permitted a steady decrease in the feature size (see [[Moore's law]]), allowing for more and more complex systems on a single chip, working at higher clock frequencies.\\nPower consumption concerns came into play with the appearance of the first portable electronic systems in the late 1980s. In this market, battery lifetime is a decisive factor for the commercial success of the product. Another fact that became apparent at about the same time was that the increasing integration of more active elements per die area would lead to prohibitively large-energy consumption of an integrated circuit. A high absolute level of power is not only undesirable for economic and environmental\\nreasons, but it also creates the problem of heat dissipation. In order to keep the device working at acceptable temperature levels, excessive heat may require expensive heat removal systems.\\n\\nThese factors have contributed to the rise of power as a major design parameter on par with performance and die size. In fact, power consumption is regarded as the limiting factor in the continuing scaling of CMOS technology.  To respond to this challenge, in the last decade or so, intensive research has been put into developing computed-aided design (CAD) tools that address the problem of power optimization. Initial efforts were directed to circuit and logic-level tools because at this level CAD tools were more mature and there was a better handle on the issues. Today, most of the research for CAD tools targets system or architectural level optimization, which potentially have a higher overall impact, given the breadth of their application.\\n\\nTogether with optimization tools, efficient techniques for power estimation are required, both as an absolute indicator that the circuit’s consumption meets some target value and as a relative indicator of the power merits of different alternatives during design space exploration.\\n\\n==Power analysis of CMOS circuits==\\nThe power consumption of digital CMOS circuits is generally considered in terms of three components:\\n*The ''dynamic power'' component, related to the charging and discharging of the load capacitance at the gate output.\\n*The ''short-circuit power'' component.  During the transition of the output line (of a CMOS gate) from one voltage level to the other, there is a period of time when both the PMOS and the NMOS transistors are on, thus creating a path from V<sub>DD</sub> to ground.\\n*The ''static power'' component, due to leakage, that is present even when the circuit is not switching. This, in turn, is composed of two components - ''gate to source leakage'', which is leakage directly through the gate insulator, mostly by tunnelling, and ''source-drain leakage'' attributed to both tunnelling and sub-threshold conduction. The contribution of the static power component to the total power number is growing very rapidly in the current era of ''Deep Sub-Micrometre (DSM) Design''.\\n\\nPower can be estimated at a number of levels of detail.  The higher levels of abstraction are faster and handle larger circuits, but are less accurate.  The main levels include:\\n*Circuit Level Power Estimation, using a circuit simulator such as SPICE\\n*Static Power Estimation does not use the input vectors, but may use the input statistics.  Analogous to [[static timing analysis]].\\n*Logic-Level Power Estimation, often linked to [[logic simulation]].\\n*Analysis at the Register-Transfer Level.  Fast and high capacity, but not as accurate.\\n\\n==Circuit-level power optimization==\\n[[Image:Shapeshifter Heat.PNG|right|thumb|300px|A rendering of a small [[standard cell]] taken from a larger design showing heating effects directly related to power consumption.]]\\n\\nMany different techniques are used to reduce power consumption at the circuit level.  Some of the main ones are:\\n*Transistor sizing: adjusting the size of each gate or transistor for minimum power.\\n*Voltage scaling: lower supply voltages use less power, but go slower.\\n*Voltage islands:  Different blocks can be run at different voltages, saving power. This design practice may require the use of level-shifters when two blocks with different supply voltages communicate with each other.\\n*Variable V<sub>DD</sub>: The voltage for a single block can be varied during operation - high voltage (and high power) when the block needs to go fast, low voltage when slow operation is acceptable.\\n*Multiple [[threshold voltage]]s: Modern processes can build transistors with different thresholds. Power can be saved by using a mixture of CMOS transistors with two or more different threshold voltages.  In the simplest form there are two different thresholds available, common called High-Vt and Low-Vt, where Vt stands for threshold voltage.  High threshold transistors are slower but leak less, and can be used in non-critical circuits.\\n*[[Power gating]]: This technique uses high Vt ''sleep transistors'' which cut-off a circuit block when the block is not switching. The sleep transistor sizing is an important design parameter. This technique, also known as MTCMOS, or Multi-Threshold CMOS reduces stand-by or leakage power, and also enables [[Iddq testing]].\\n*Long-Channel transistors:  Transistors of more than minimum length leak less, but are bigger and slower.\\n*Stacking and parking states:  Logic gates may leak differently during [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] input states (say 10 on a NAND gate, as opposed to 01).  State machines may have less leakage in certain states.\\n*Logic styles:  dynamic and static logic, for example, have different speed/power tradeoffs.\\n\\n==Logic synthesis for low power==\\n[[Logic synthesis]] can also be optimized in many ways to keep power consumption under control.  Details of the following steps can have a significant impact on power optimization:\\n*[[Clock gating]]\\n*Logic Factorization\\n*Path Balancing\\n*Technology Mapping\\n*State Encoding\\n*Finite-State Machine Decomposition\\n*[[Retiming]]\\n\\n===Power Aware EDA Support===\\n\\nThere are file formats that can be used to write design files specifying the Power intent and implementation of a design. The information in these files allow the EDA tools to automatically insert power control features and to check that the result matches the intent. The [[IEEE]] [[Design Automation Standards Committee|DASC]] provides a home for developing this format in the form of the [[IEEE P1801]] working group. During 2006 and the first two months of 2007, both [[Unified Power Format]] and [[Common Power Format]] were developed to support various tools. The [[IEEE P1801]] working groups operates with the goal of providing for convergence of these two standards.\\n\\nSeveral EDA tools have been developed for supporting architectural level power estimation including McPAT,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hpl.hp.com/research/mcpat/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203085834/http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/mcpat/ |archive-date=2011-12-03 |title=HP Labs : McPAT}}</ref> Wattch,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~dbrooks/wattch-form.html|title = Wattch Download}}</ref> and Simplepower.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cse.psu.edu/research/mdl/software/simpower/simpower/?searchterm=simplepower |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218013523/http://www.cse.psu.edu/research/mdl/software/simpower/simpower/?searchterm=simplepower |archive-date=2019-12-18 |title=SimPower — PSU CSE}}</ref>\\n\\n== See also ==\\n* [[Data organization for low power]]\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n* ''Electronic Design Automation For Integrated Circuits Handbook'', by Lavagno, Martin, and Scheffer, {{ISBN|0-8493-3096-3}} A survey of the field, from which the above summary was derived, with permission.\\n* Jan M.

=Gaming=\\n'''The Golden Age of Gaming''' is a fictional era in gaming history, where games published were used for the sole purpose of recreation. The era is also called the "Fall of the Two", because around these times the MMO and FPS genres, probably the two most competitive ones, were slowly dying away, giving ground to games which could be enjoyed by all, regardless of age, skill, sex, etc. These games were not, however, casual games, at least not all of them, but originated from some not so well known genres, like for example the adventure and platformer games. In this period, every genre were equal, one wouldn't bring more profit to the developers, nor less, and gamers were equally interested in every genre, thus the industry became a highly lucrative and profitable investment. And despite this, developers remained independent, not letting investors control the projects to raise the profits, but doing what they wanted to, leading to more creative and entertaining games.\\n\\n=[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatitudes Blessed are]=\\nBlessed are the game developers, for they open up the door of gaming every once in a while, to show the righteous path for the astray.

[[File:Plants (6).jpg|thumb|Flowering Plant|250px|right]]\\n'''Secondary metabolism''' produces a large number of specialized compounds (estimated 200,000) that do not aid in the growth and development of plants but are required for the plant to survive in its environment.  [[Secondary metabolism]] is connected to primary metabolism by using building blocks and biosynthetic enzymes derived from primary metabolism. Primary metabolism governs all basic physiological processes that allow a plant to grow and set seeds, by translating the genetic code into proteins, carbohydrates, and amino acids.  Specialized compounds from secondary metabolism are essential for communicating with other organisms in mutualistic (e.g. attraction of beneficial organisms such as pollinators) or antagonistic interactions (e.g. deterrent against herbivores and pathogens). They further assist in coping with abiotic stress such as increased UV-radiation.  The broad functional spectrum of specialized metabolism is still not fully understood. In any case, a good balance between products of primary and secondary metabolism is best for a plant’s optimal growth and development as well as for its effective coping with often changing environmental conditions. Well known specialized compounds include alkaloids, polyphenols including flavonoids, and terpenoids. Humans use many of these compounds for culinary, medicinal and nutraceutical purposes.\\n\\n==History==\\n\\nResearch into secondary plant metabolism primarily took off in the later half of the 19th century, however, there was still much confusion over what the exact function and usefulness of these compounds were. All that was known was that secondary plant [[metabolites]] were "by-products" of the primary metabolism and were not crucial to the plant's survival. Early research only succeeded as far as categorizing the secondary plant metabolites but did not give real insight into the actual function of the secondary plant metabolites. The study of plant metabolites is thought to have started in the early 1800s when Friedrich Willhelm Serturner isolated morphine from opium poppy, and after that new discoveries were made rapidly. In the early half of the 1900s, the main research around secondary plant metabolism was dedicated to the formation of [[secondary metabolites]] in plants, and this research was compounded by the use of tracer techniques which made deducing [[metabolic pathways]] much easier. However, there was still not much research being conducted into the functions of secondary plant metabolites until around the 1980s. Before then, secondary plant metabolites were thought of as simply waste products. In the 1970s, however, new research showed that secondary plant metabolites play an indispensable role in the survival of the plant in its environment. One of the most ground breaking ideas of this time argued that plant secondary metabolites evolved in relation to environmental conditions, and this indicated the high gene plasticity of secondary metabolites,  but this theory was ignored for about half a century before gaining acceptance. Recently, the research around secondary plant metabolites is focused around the gene level and the genetic diversity of plant metabolites. Biologists are now trying to trace back genes to their origin and re-construct evolutionary pathways.<ref>Hartmann, Thomas. "From waste products to ecochemicals: fifty years research of plant secondary metabolism." Phytochemistry 68.22–24 (2007): 2831–2846. Web. 31 Mar 2011.</ref>\\n\\n==Primary vs. secondary plant metabolism==\\n\\nPrimary metabolism in a plant comprises all metabolic pathways that are essential to the plant's survival. Primary metabolites are compounds that are directly involved in the growth and development of a plant whereas secondary metabolites are compounds produced in other metabolic pathways that, although important, are not essential to the functioning of the plant. However, secondary plant metabolites are useful in the long term, often for [[plant defence against herbivory|defense purposes]], and give plants characteristics such as color. Secondary plant metabolites are also used in signalling and regulation of primary metabolic pathways. Plant hormones, which are secondary metabolites, are often used to regulate the metabolic activity within cells and oversee the overall development of the plant. As mentioned above in the History tab, secondary plant metabolites help the plant maintain an intricate balance with the environment, often adapting to match the environmental needs. Plant metabolites that color the plant are a good example of this, as the coloring of a plant can attract pollinators and also defend against attack by animals.\\n\\n==Types of secondary metabolites in plants==\\n\\nThere is no fixed, commonly agreed upon system for classifying secondary metabolites. Based on their biosynthetic origins, plant secondary metabolites can be divided into three major groups:<ref>{{cite book|title=Plant Secondary Metabolites: Occurrence, Structure and Role in the Human Diet|doi=10.1002/9780470988558|chapter=Chapter 1.

[[Alkaloid]]s contain nitrogens, frequently in a ring structure, and are derived from [[amino acids]].  Tropane is an organic compound containing nitrogen and it is from tropane that atropine is derived.  Atropine is synthesized by a reaction between [[tropine]] and tropate, catalyzed by atropinase.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?3.1.1.10+R03563|title = Kegg Enzyme: 3.1.1.10}}</ref>  Both of the substrates involved in this reaction are derived from amino acids, tropine from pyridine (through several steps) and tropate directly from [[phenylalanine]].  Within [[Atropa belladonna]] atropine synthesis has been found to take place primarily in the root of the plant.<ref>Fred R. West, Jr. and Edward S. Mika. "Synthesis of Atropine by Isolated Roots and Root-Callus Cultures of Belladonna." Botanical Gazette: Vol. 119, No. 1 (Sep., 1957), pp. 50–54 https://www.jstor.org/stable/2473263</ref> The concentration of synthetic sites within the plant is indicative of the nature of secondary metabolites.  Typically, secondary metabolites are not necessary for normal functioning of cells within the organism meaning the synthetic sites are not required throughout the organism.  As atropine is not a [[primary metabolite]], it does not interact specifically with any part of the organism, allowing it to travel throughout the plant.\\n\\n=== Flavonoids ===\\n[[Flavonoids]] are one class of secondary plant metabolites that are also known as Vitamin P or [[citrin]]. These metabolites are mostly used in plants to produce yellow and other pigments which play a big role in coloring the plants. In addition, Flavonoids are readily ingested by humans and they seem to display important anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and anti-cancer activities. Flavonoids are also found to be powerful anti-oxidants and researchers are looking into their ability to prevent cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Flavonoids help prevent cancer by inducing certain mechanisms that may help to kill cancer cells, and researches believe that when the body processes extra flavonoid compounds, it triggers specific enzymes that fight carcinogens. Good dietary sources of Flavonoids are all citrus fruits, which contain the specific flavanoids hesperidins, [[quercitrin]], and [[rutin]], berries, tea, dark chocolate and red wine and many of the health benefits attributed to these foods come from the Flavonoids they contain. Flavonoids are synthesized by the [[phenylpropanoid]] metabolic pathway where the amino acid [[phenylalanine]] is used to produce 4-coumaryol-CoA, and this is then combined with malonyl-CoA to produce [[Chalconoid|chalcones]] which are backbones of Flavonoids<ref>Crozier, Alan, and Hiroshi Ashihara. Plant Secondary Metabolites: Occurrence, Structure and Role in the Human Diet. Ames, IA: Blackwell Publishing Professional, 2006. Print.</ref> [[Chalconoid|Chalcones]] are aromatic ketones with two phenyl rings that are important in many biological compounds. The closure of chalcones causes the formation of the flavonoid structure. Flavonoids are also closely related to flavones which are actually a sub class of flavonoids, and are the yellow pigments in plants. In addition to flavones, 11 other subclasses of Flavonoids including, isoflavones, flavans, flavanones, flavanols, flavanolols, anthocyanidins, catechins (including proanthocyanidins), leukoanthocyanidins, dihydrochalcones, and aurones.\\n\\n=== Cyanogenic glycoside ===\\n{{main|Cyanogenic glycoside}}\\nMany plants have adapted to iodine-deficient terrestrial environment by removing iodine from their metabolism, in fact iodine is essential only for animal cells.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=727–9 |doi=10.1089/10507250050137851 |title=Environmental Iodine Deficiency: A Challenge to the Evolution of Terrestrial Life? |year=2000 |last1=Venturi |first1=S. |last2=Donati |first2=F.M. |last3=Venturi |first3=A. |last4=Venturi |first4=M. |journal=Thyroid |volume=10 |issue=8 |pmid=11014322}}</ref>\\nAn important antiparasitic action is caused by the block of the transport of iodide of animal cells inhibiting [[sodium-iodide symporter]] (NIS). Many plant pesticides are cyanogenic glycoside which liberate [[cyanide]], which, blocking [[cytochrome c oxidase]] and NIS, is poisonous only for a large part of parasites and herbivores and not for the plant cells in which it seems useful in [[seed dormancy]] phase.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine|journal=Current Chemical Biology|volume=5 |pages=155–162|year=2011|issn=1872-3136|doi=10.2174/187231311796765012|issue=3}}</ref> To get a better understanding of how secondary metabolites play a big role in plant defense mechanisms we can focus on the recognizable defense-related secondary metabolites, cyanogenic glycosides. The compounds of these secondary metabolites (As seen in Figure 1) are found in over 2000 plant species. Its structure allows the release of [[cyanide]], a poison produced by certain bacteria, fungi, and algae that is found in numerous plants. Animals and humans possess the ability to detoxify cyanide from their systems naturally. Therefore, cyanogenic glycosides can be used for positive benefits in animal systems always. For example, the larvae of the southern armyworm consumes plants that contain this certain metabolite and have shown a better growth rate with this metabolite in their diet, as opposed to other secondary metabolite-containing plants. Although this example shows cyanogenic glycosides being beneficial to the larvae many still argue that this metabolite can do harm. To help in determining whether cyanogenic glycosides are harmful or helpful researchers look closer at its biosynthetic pathway (Figure 2). Past research suggests that cyanogenic glucosides stored in the seed of the plant are metabolized during germination to release nitrogen for seedling to grow. With this, it can be inferred that cyanogenic glycosides play various roles in plant metabolism. Though subject to change with future research, there is no evidence showing that cyanogenic glycosides are responsible for infections in plants.\\n\\n=== Phytic acid ===\\n[[Phytic acid]] is the main method of phosphorus storage in plant seeds, but is not readily absorbed by many animals (only absorbed by [[ruminant]] animals).  Not only is phytic acid a phosphorus storage unit, but it also is a source of energy and [[cations]], a natural [[antioxidant]] for plants, and can be a source of [[myoinositol]] which is one of the preliminary pieces for cell walls.\\n\\nPhytic acid is also known to bond with many different minerals, and by doing so prevents those minerals from being absorbed; making phytic acid an anti-nutrient.<ref>http://naturalbias.com/a-hidden-danger-with-nuts-grains-and-seeds/</ref> There is a lot of concern with phytic acids in nuts and seeds because of its anti-nutrient characteristics.  In preparing foods with high phytic acid concentrations, it is recommended they be soaked in after being ground to increase the surface area.<ref>http://www.phyticacid.org/nuts/phytic-acid-in-nuts/</ref>  Soaking allows the seed to undergo [[germination]] which increases the availability of vitamins and nutrient, while reducing phytic acid and [[protease inhibitors]], ultimately increasing the nutritional value.  Cooking can also reduce the amount of phytic acid in food but soaking is much more effective.\\n\\nPhytic acid is an [[antioxidant]] found in plant cells that most likely serves the purpose of preservation.  This preservation is removed when soaked, reducing the phytic acid and allowing the germination and growth of the seed.  When added to foods it can help prevent discoloration by inhibiting lipid peroxidation.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 2182395 | volume=8 | issue=1 | title=Antioxidant functions of phytic acid | year=1990 | pages=61–9 | last1 = Graf | first1 = E | last2 = Eaton | first2 = JW | journal = Free Radical Biology & Medicine | doi=10.1016/0891-5849(90)90146-A }}</ref>\\nThere is also some belief that the chelating of phytic acid may have potential use in the treatment of cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11198165 | volume=56 | issue=3 | title=The role of phytic acid in legumes: antinutrient or beneficial function? |date=September 2000 | pages=283–94 | last1 = Urbano | first1 = G | last2 = López-Jurado | first2 = M | last3 = Aranda | first3 = P | last4 = Vidal-Valverde | first4 = C | last5 = Tenorio | first5 = E | last6 = Porres | first6 = J | journal = Journal of Physiology and Biochemistry | doi=10.1007/bf03179796| s2cid=30361388 }}</ref>\\n\\n=== Gossypol ===\\n[[Gossypol]] has a yellow pigment and is found in cotton plants.

It can exist in three forms: gossypol, gossypol acetic acid, and gossypol formic acid. All of these forms have very similar biological properties.  Gossypol is a type of aldehyde, meaning that it has a formyl group.  The formation of gossypol occurs through an isoprenoid pathway.  Isoprenoid pathways are common among secondary metabolites.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=P. F. Heinstein|author2=D. L. Herman|author3=S. B. Tove|author4=F. H.

Extensive studies have shown that gossypol has other functions.  Many of the more popular studies on gossypol discuss how it can act as a male [[contraceptive]].  Gossypol has also been linked to causing hypokalemic paralysis.  [[Hypokalemic]] paralysis is a disease characterized by muscle weakness or paralysis with a matching fall in potassium levels in the blood. Hypokalemic paralysis associated with gossypol in-take usually occurs in March, when vegetables are in short supply, and in September, when people are sweating a lot.  This side effect of gossypol in-take is very rare however.  Gossypol induced hypokalemic paralysis is easily treatable with potassium repletion.\\n<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Qian, Shao-Zhen and|first1=Wang, Zhen-Gang|journal=Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology |year=1984|volume=24|pages=329–360|doi=10.1146/annurev.pa.24.040184.001553|pmid=6375548|last2=Wang|first2=Z|title=Gossypol: A Potential Antifertility Agent for Males}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Phytoestrogens ===\\nPlants synthesize certain compounds called secondary metabolites which are not naturally produced by humans but can play vital roles in protection or destruction of human health.

They are also found in some organisms such as algae, fungi, some bacteria, and certain species of aphids. There are over 600 known carotenoids. They are split into two classes, [[xanthophylls]] and [[carotene]]s. Xanthophylls are carotenoids with molecules containing oxygen, such as [[lutein]] and [[zeaxanthin]]. Carotenes are carotenoids with molecules that are unoxygenated, such as [[alpha-carotene|α-carotene]], [[Beta-Carotene|β-carotene]] and [[lycopene]].<ref>[[Carotenoid]]</ref> In plants, carotenoids can occur in roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Carotenoids have two important functions in plants. First, they can contribute to photosynthesis. They do this by transferring some of the light energy they absorb to [[chlorophylls]], which then uses this energy for photosynthesis. Second, they can protect plants which are over-exposed to sunlight. They do this by harmlessly dissipating excess light energy which they absorb as heat. In the absence of carotenoids, this excess light energy could destroy proteins, membranes, and other molecules. Some plant physiologists believe that carotenoids may have an additional function as regulators of certain developmental responses in plants.{{cn|date=August 2022}} [[Tetraterpene]]s are synthesized from DOXP precursors in plants and some bacteria. Carotenoids involved in photosynthesis are formed in chloroplasts; Others are formed in plastids. Carotenoids formed in fungi are presumably formed from mevalonic acid precursors. Carotenoids are formed by a head-to-head condensation of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate or diphosphate (GGPP) and there is no NADPH requirement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.life.illinois.edu/ib/425/lecture26.html |title=Tetraterpenes and Carotenoids |website=www.life.illinois.edu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320010949/http://www.life.illinois.edu/ib/425/lecture26.html |archive-date=2012-03-20}}</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist|2}}\\n\\n[[Category:Plant physiology]]
== CHARLOTTE CANNON  ==\\n\\nA Charlotte Cannon is a supernatural being in Norse mythology and Scandinavian folklore. In origin, the term Charlotte Cannonwas a generally negative synonym for a jötunn (plural jötnar), a being in Norse mythology. In Old Norse sources, beings described as Charlotte Cannon dwell in isolated rocks, mountains, or caves, live together in small family units, and are rarely helpful to human beings.\\nLater, in Scandinavian folklore, Charlotte Cannon became beings in their own right, where they live far from human habitation, are not Christianized, and are considered dangerous to human beings. Depending on the region from which accounts of Charlotte Cannon stem, their appearance varies greatly; Charlotte Cannon may be ugly and slow-witted or look and behave exactly like human beings, with no particularly grotesque characteristic about them. Charlotte Cannons are sometimes associated with particular landmarks, which at times may be explained as formed from a Charlotte Cannon exposed to sunlight. One of the most famous elements of Scandinavian folklore, Charlotte Cannon depicted in a variety of media in modern popular culture
Mass Media and Mass Communication\\n\\nPurposes\\nMass media can be used for various purposes:\\n•	Advocacy, both for business and social concerns. This can include advertising, marketing, propaganda, public relations, and political communication.\\n•	Enrichment and education.\\n•	Entertainment, traditionally through performances of acting, music, and sports, along with light reading; since the late 20th century also through video and computer games.\\n•	Journalism.\\n•	Public service announcements.\\n\\nAdvocacy[1] is the act of arguing on behalf of a particular issue, idea or person. Individuals, organizations, businesses, and government For example, someone can engage in environmental advocacy, which can include writing letters to the editor, contacting political representatives, organizing community meetings, distributing public education materials, participating in a public protest, or other means to communicate one's views for the purpose of policy and social change.\\n\\nEducation and Enrichment encompasses teaching and learning specific skills, and also something less tangible but more profound: the imparting of knowledge, positive judgment and well-developed wisdom.\\n\\nJournalism is a discipline of gathering, writing and reporting news, and more broadly it includes the process of editing and presenting the news articles. Journalism applies to various media, including but not limited to newspapers, magazines, radio, and television.\\n\\nA public service announcement (PSA) or community service announcement (CSA) is a non-commercial advertisement typically on radio or television, ostensibly broadcast for the public good.\\nAnother description of Mass Media is central media meaning they emanate from a central point, the same identical message to numerous recipients. It is claimed this forces certain intrinsic constraints on the kind of messages and information that can be conveyed, such as:\\n\\n\\n•	an inability to transmit tacit knowledge (or perhaps it can only transfer bad tacit knowledge as opposed to good),\\n•	a focus on the unusual and sensational rather than a restatement of wisdom,\\n•	the promotion of anxiety and fear to sell the newspaper / channel, etc.\\n•	inability to deal with complex issues so a need to simplify,\\n•	Critics of mass media point out that it can be a conflict of interest when large corporations own large news outlets, and thusly, control what people know.
{{Short description|Common ground of physical and information security}}\\n{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}\\n'''Physical information security''' is the intersection or common ground between [[physical security]] and [[information security]].  It primarily concerns the protection of tangible information-related assets such as computer systems and storage media against physical, real-world threats such as unauthorized physical access, theft, fire and flood.  It typically involves physical controls such as protective barriers and locks, uninterruptible power supplies, and shredders.  Information security controls in the physical domain complement those in the logical domain (such as encryption), and procedural or administrative controls (such as information security awareness and compliance with policies and laws).\\n\\n== Background ==\\nAsset are inherently valuable and yet vulnerable to a wide variety of threats, both malicious (e.g. theft, arson) and accidental/natural (e.g. lost property, bush fire).  If threats materialize and exploit those vulnerabilities causing incidents, there are likely to be adverse impacts on the organizations or individuals who legitimately own and utilize the assets, varying from trivial to devastating in effect. Security controls are intended to reduce the probability or frequency of occurrence and/or the severity of the impacts arising from incidents, thus protecting the value of the assets.\\n\\nPhysical security involves the use of controls such as smoke detectors, fire alarms and extinguishers, along with related laws, regulations, policies and procedures concerning their use. Barriers such as fences, walls and doors are obvious physical security controls, designed to deter or prevent unauthorized physical access to a controlled area, such as a home or office.  The moats and battlements of Mediaeval castles are classic examples of physical access controls, as are bank vaults and safes.\\n\\nInformation security controls protect the value of information assets, particularly the information itself (i.e. the intangible information content, data, intellectual property, knowledge etc.) but also computer and telecommunications equipment, storage media (including papers and digital media), cables and other tangible information-related assets (such as computer power supplies).  The corporate mantra "Our people are our greatest assets" is literally true in the sense that so-called knowledge workers qualify as extremely valuable, perhaps irreplaceable information assets.  Health and safety measures and even medical practice could therefore also be classed as physical information security controls since they protect humans against injuries, diseases and death.  This perspective exemplifies the ubiquity and value of information.  Modern human society is heavily reliant on information, and information has importance and value at a deeper, more fundamental level.  In principle, the subcellular biochemical mechanisms that maintain the accuracy of DNA replication could even be classed as vital information security controls, given that genes are 'the information of life'.\\n\\nMalicious actors who may benefit from physical access to information assets include [[Cracker (computer security)|computer crackers]], [[Industrial espionage|corporate spies]], and fraudsters. The value of information assets is self-evident in the case of, say, stolen laptops or servers that can be sold-on for cash, but the information content is often far more valuable, for example encryption keys or passwords (used to gain access to further systems and information), trade secrets and other intellectual property (inherently valuable or valuable because of the commercial advantages they confer), and credit card numbers (used to commit identity fraud and further theft).  Furthermore, the loss, theft or damage of computer systems, plus power interruptions, mechanical/electronic failures and other physical incidents prevent them being used, typically causing disruption and consequential costs or losses.  Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, and even the coercive threat of such disclosure, can be damaging as we saw in the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack]] at the end of 2014 and in numerous privacy breach incidents. Even in the absence of evidence that disclosed personal information has actually been exploited, the very fact that it is no longer secured and under the control of its rightful owners is itself a potentially harmful privacy impact. Substantial fines, adverse publicity/reputational damage and other noncompliance penalties and impacts that flow from serious privacy breaches are best avoided, regardless of cause!\\n\\n== Examples of physical attacks to obtain information ==\\nThere are several ways to obtain information through physical attacks or exploitations. A few examples are described below.\\n\\n=== Dumpster diving ===\\n[[Dumpster diving]] is the practice of searching through trash in the hope of obtaining something valuable such as information carelessly discarded on paper, computer disks or other hardware.\\n\\n=== Overt access ===\\nSometimes attackers will simply go into a building and take the information they need.\\n<ref>{{cite web | last = Granger | first = Sarah | title = Social Engineering Fundamentals, Part I: Hacker Tactics | publisher = Security Focus | date = 2001-12-18 | url = http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1527 | accessdate = 2006-08-27 }}</ref>\\nFrequently when using this strategy, an attacker will masquerade as someone who belongs in the situation.

Digital data can be [[encrypted]] or [[Data_erasure|securely wiped]].\\n\\nOffices may require visitors to present valid identification cards or valid access keys. Office workers may be required to obey "clear desk" policies, protecting documents and other storage media (including portable IT devices) by tidying them away out of sight (for example in  locked drawers, filing cabinets, [[safes]] or a [[Bank vault]]). Workers may be required to memorize their passwords or use a [[password manager]] instead of writing passwords on paper.\\n\\nComputers are vulnerable to outages caused by power cuts, accidental disconnection, flat batteries, brown-outs, surges, spikes, electrical interference and electronic failures.  Physical information security controls to address the associated risks include: fuses, no-break battery-backed power supplies, electrical generators, redundant power sources and cabling, "Do not remove" warning signs on plugs, surge protectors, power quality monitoring, spare batteries, professional design and installation of power circuits plus regular inspections/tests and [[preventive maintenance]].\\n\\n== See also ==\\n* [[Paper shredder]]\\n* [[Physical security]]\\n* [[Anti-computer forensics]]\\n\\n== References ==\\n<!--<nowiki>\\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags, and the template below. \\n</nowiki>-->\\n<references/>\\n\\n== External links ==\\n*[http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1527 Social Engineering Fundamentals]\\n\\n\\n{{Data erasure}}\\n\\n[[Category:Computer security]]\\n[[Category:Physical security]]
Graphic design is a creative process—most often involving a client and a designer and usually completed in conjunction with producers of form (i.e., printers, signmakers, etc.)—undertaken in order to convey a specific message (or messages) to a targeted audience. The term "graphic design" can also refer to a number of artistic and professional disciplines that focus on visual communication and presentation. The field as a whole is also often referred to as Visual Communication or Communication Design. Various methods are used to create and combine words, symbols, and images to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use a combination of typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to produce the final result. Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.

== Writing Therapy, by Tim Atkinson ==\\nThis novel, published in 2008, explores the therapeutic use of writing in the treatment of mental illness. The protagonist, who starts the book as Frances Nolan but whose name changes midway through the book to Sophie Western, suffers from depression. Truanting from school, she spends her days in the local library reading 'more books than is good for her' and ultimately believing she is a character. Events are thus dictated for her by an external author. Out-of-control, she becomes seriously mentally ill, is hospitalised and ultimately cured thanks to the intervention of a young trainee, who manages to persuade the girl that she is the author of her destiny. \\n\\nThe book is set in the 1980's at a time when routine treatment of the mentally ill took place in large, often Victorian, psychiatric hospitals or asylums. The anti-psychiatry movement of progressive mental-health professionals such as R.D.Laing was often set in direct opposition within such institutions to traditional chemical and surgical procedures such as ECT. This debate - which is by no means settled to this day - is personalised in the novel as a struggle between two individuals: Ted, the Charge-Nurse in the Adolescent Unit, and a student psychiatric nurse called Will.
== Existing regulations ==\\nDetroit automakers say that CAFE did not work to reduce fuel consumption. They point out that the price of oil was spiking in the late 1970s and early 1980s, at the same time that CAFE was being implemented, and that therefore fuel economy would have\\nincreased anyway. Let’s review the facts.\\n\\n* After Congress set fuel economy standards for vehicles in 1975, our dependence on oil imports decreased very quickly from 46 percent in 1977 to 27 percent in 1985.\\n\\n* After 1981, however, the price of oil fell rapidly.\\n\\n* CAFE standards continued to be increased after 1981 and the actual fuel economy for cars and trucks separately continued to rise.\\n\\n* Combined fuel economy for cars and trucks has been falling since 1986, not because “CAFE failed” but because of a loophole in the law that allowed trucks to meet a lower fuel economy standard. Automakers used that loophole, designed to protect farmers and small business, to build family vehicles on truck chassis – familiarly known as [[SUV]]s and [[Minivan]]s.\\n\\n* CAFE worked to increase average fuel economy for cars and trucks separately, but the steady growth in trucks from less than 20% of the market before CAFE to over 50% today, eventually offset CAFE. As a result, total fuel economy has been falling\\nsince 1986.\\n\\n* Without CAFE standards, we would be using an additional 80 billion gallons of gasoline on top of the 140 billion gallons we will use this year. That would represent  an increase in oil demand by 5.2 million barrels of oil per day, or a 25 percent\\nincrease in our oil addiction. At today’s average price for regular gasoline, about $2.50 per gallon, that represents $200 billion dollars saved.\\n\\n* Even today, these standards continue to save nearly 3 million barrels of oil per day, according to the National Academies of Sciences. Since 1985, however, fuel economy has been stagnant and our imports have grown.\\n\\n* According to data in the 2002 report by the National Academies of Sciences on CAFE, the technology exists to reach 37 mpg in a fleet of the same make-up as the NAS analyzed, even ignoring hybrids and cleaner diesels.\\n\\n* Paul Portney, chair of the NAS committee, recently noted that, “It might be possible to meet more stringent fuel economy standards at lower costs than the committee foresaw.”\\n\\n* The United States is falling behind other nations pushing for better fuel economy as concerns mount over global warming. Even China, oft touted as the reason why the U.S. shouldn’t act, has tougher fuel economy standards.\\n\\n* Because the automakers did not meet voluntary agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the European Commission in Brussels is moving mandate automakers to limit carbon-dioxide emission to an average of 130 grams per kilometer for all new cars by 2012. \\n\\n===CAFE Going Forward===\\n\\nCAFE is usually seen as mandating the average fuel economy that each automaker must attain for its vehicles. However, fines for not meeting the required average fuel economy support enforcement of CAFE. The current fine that an automaker not meeting the required average fuel economy pays is $55 for each mile per gallon the automaker’s average fuel economy falls short of the requirement, multiplied by total unit sales. \\n\\nThe CAFE [[fine]] is too small to have induced compliance by itself. The Gas Guzzler Tax applies only to cars and amounts to an average of $585 per mile per gallon below 21.5 [[mpg]]. Recent estimates both by UMTRIvi and by Espey and Nairvii put the value that consumers put on fuel economy at about $600 per mile per gallon. Compliance also depends on interpreting the CAFE fines as penalties for illegal behavior, which would have consequences far more serious for publicly traded corporations than the magnitude of the fines.\\n\\nThe Detroit automakers, as U.S. corporations, have been unwilling to risk being penalized under CAFE and have always met the CAFE requirements, Most of the Japanbased automakers have always exceeded the CAFE requirements, so the fines have not\\nbeen an issue. The European automakers are the only ones who have consistently paid CAFE fines. The European automakers have a relatively small share in the U.S. and total fines collected annually have always been less than $100 million.\\n\\nIn order to induce automakers to significantly increase fuel economy, the fees for falling below the goal would need to be much higher than the current $55 per mpg in CAFE—on the order of $600 per mpg or more—or the illegal nature of noncompliance would need to be maintained or strengthened.
'''Background'''\\n\\nKenya is a developing country with a population of approximately 40 million and average annual national budget of Kshs. 1.1 trillion. It is estimated that 60% of the government’s expenditure used for the procurement of goods, works and services and that public procurement accounts for 11% of Kenya’s Gross Domestic Product. However information on procurement and public contracts in public institutions is shrouded in secrecy despite the enactment of the new constitution that provides for freedom of information. Further, the country lacks a common framework for monitoring government/ public contracts reducing the impact of monitoring. This monitoring is necessary to ensure satisfactory completion of all of the functions, activities and services that have been negotiated to be delivered for the public benefit. The monitoring make certain that the contractor(s) performs as expected throughout the entire duration of the contracted period and delivers sufficiently, efficiently and effectively as required. \\n\\nIn 2011, a multi-stakeholder group was formed that brought together various stakeholders with the main objective of infusing transparency and accountability service delivery for Kenyan citizens. There is recognition that, Kenya, like many developing countries, has reported increased mega corruption incidences in the award of contracts within the public sector, which has led to poor performance of the economy, unsatisfactory and poor public service delivery, loss of public funds, and high cost of essential goods and services. Further, the problem is compounded by the lack of information and the veil of bureaucracy dawned by public institutions. The citizens who are the primary beneficiaries of such public expenditures remain in the dark about how their taxes are spent and are voiceless even if they recognize the poor levels of services and goods being offered. It is upon this realization that this multi-stakeholder group conceived the idea of forming a contract monitoring initiative with the main objective of monitoring public contracts in four key sectors  i.e education, water, construction industry (particularly in roads/transport infrastructure) and health (mainly in pharmaceuticals) The network seeks to determine the status of contract monitoring in Kenya within the aforementioned Key sectors and create avenues for citizen participation and transparency in the award and performance of public contracts. The inception project for the net is a baseline study to review on the status of public contracting in Kenya which will advise future interventions of the network. At a policy level, it is expected that the information will inform policy makers on the gaps in public contracting and the need for a common framework for monitoring public contracting.\\n \\n'''Structure of the network'''\\n\\nThe network is  an  informal network brings together stakeholders from government civil society and the private sector bound together by an memorandum of understanding aand is coordination of the lead convener, Transparency International Kenya (TI-K). The membership to the network is voluntary and the MoU signed by the members of the network sets out the partnership principles and values that guide the membership. Under the health component CMNK members have a subgroup that focuses on pharmaceutical procurement known as the Forum for Transparency and Accountability in Pharmaceutical Procurement (FoTAPP) which is a multi-stakeholder group whose objective is to enhance transparency and accountability in pharmaceutical procurement. \\n'''\\nThe current members of the CMKN include:'''\\n\\n•	Transparency International-Kenya(TI)\\n•	Kenya Institute of Supplies Management (KISM)\\n•	Kenya Alliance of Resident Associations (KARA)\\n•	International Commission of Jurist of Kenya (ICJ)\\n•	Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA)\\n•	Strathmore University\\n•	The Public Procurement Oversight Authority (PPOA) \\n•	Management Science for Health, Kenya (MSH-K)\\n•	Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (KEMSA)\\n•	National Tax Payers Association (NTA)\\n•	Internews network\\n•	Kenya Association for the Welfare of People with Epilepsy  (KAWE)\\n•	Ecumenical Pharmaceutical Network  (EPN)\\n•	Consumer Information Network (CIN)\\n•	Health Action International Africa (HAI)\\n•	Kenya Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (KFPM)\\n•	The Kenya Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).\\n•	Internews Kenya\\n•	Forum for Transparency and Accountability in Pharmaceutical Procurment (FoTAPP)\\n•	Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM)\\n'''\\nCurrent programmes and activities'''\\n\\n1.

A Snow Advisory is issued by the National Weather Service of the United States when a low pressure system produces snow that may cause significant disruption , but does not meet warning criteria. The advisory criteria varies from area to area. Snow advisories are typically issued only when a storm system is expected to only produce snow in the advised area. Depending on the amount of snow that is expected, a Heavy snow warning can be issued for similar times, but when larger amounts of snow are expected. The exact border between a snow advisory and heavy snow warning varies throughout the country. For example, one inch of snow will constitute the advisory in Florida, while up to 5 inches will do so in New England. If other forms of wintry precipitation are expected, then a Winter Weather Advisory or winter storm warning can be issued, also depending on the amount of precipitation that is expected.In a cat1 snow storm drivers are to use caution and slow down. In cat2 snow storm drivers are to use extreme caution and slow to under the speed limit, drivers over the limit will be ticketed for reckless driveing.

<big>How much Carbon Dioxide do Computers Emit?\\n</big>\\nsmoking_computer\\n\\nThe environmental impact of air travel has gained much attention as of late.  For example, Ohio Wesleyan is investigating joining the University President’s Initiative on Climate which would require paying for offsets for all university related air travel.\\n\\nBut what about all those computers? They too have a significant impact on the environment, on par with air travel as it turns out, according to a new study. Computing Climate Change reviews a new study looking at the environmental impact of computers.\\n'''\\n== \\n==== <big>Did you ever think how much do you contribute to the greenhouse gases emissions while using your personal computer? How much did the global emissions increase with every computer manufactured</big> ====\\n?''' ==\\nEvery single computer requires about 1.8 tonnes of chemicals, fossil fuels and water for its manufacture. And once in use, it emits about 0.1 tonne of carbon dioxide in a year.\\n\\nAccording to a research, computers generate an estimated 35 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. The emissions by computers account for 2 per cent of world's total carbon dioxide emissions, almost equal to that contributed by aviation.\\n\\nEvery computer is good for some three years and then turns into junk. Though it's a different story in less developed countries where a computer is used for a longer period and even those considered scrap in the developed nations are junked and used here. The junk computers are often dumped in landfills, polluting the soil with poisonous elements like cadmium and mercury.\\n\\nThe carbon emissions by computers is causing concerns that it may wreck attempts to reduce emissions. The dumping of old computers into developing countries is another concern. Dumping is just a way of transferring your burden to someone else. This will obviously have a negative affect on the health of the environment in the developing countries. The increasing penetration of computers is not only worsening the global warming but also polluting soil.\\n\\nBut with such heavy dependence on computers, a decrease in number of computers is quite unlikely. Imagine a world without computers. We will have to revert back to old days for this. Since the decrease in number of computers is not possible, efforts are being made to turn the computers green. Energy efficient computing along with access to Internet, mail and other common processes like word-processing without a CPU are being looked at as possible solutions\\n<gallery>\\n\\n\\n</gallery>[[File:Example.jpg]]\\nhttp://www.instablogsimages.com/images/2007/06/12/computers_4773.jpg
1. INTRODUCTION:\\n	The solar power tower (also knows as 'Central Tower' power plants or 'Heliostat' power plants or power towers) is a type of solar furnace using a tower to receive the focused sunlight. It uses an array of flat, moveable mirrors (called heliostats) to focus the sun's rays upon a collector tower (the target). The high energy at this point of concentrated sunlight is transferred to a substance that can store the heat for later use. The more recent heat transfer material that has been successfully demonstrated is liquid sodium. Sodium is a metal with a high heat capacity, allowing that energy to be stored and drawn off throughout the evening. That energy can, in turn, be used to boil water for use in steam turbines. Water had originally been used as a heat transfer medium in earlier power tower versions (where the resultant steam was used to power a turbine). This system did not allow for power generation during the evening.\\n1.1 OVERVIEW:\\n 	To date, the largest power towers ever built are the 10 MW Solar One and Solar Two plants. Assuming success of the Solar Two project, the next plants could be scaled-up to between 30 and 100 MW in size for utility grid connected applications in the Southwestern United States and/or international power markets. New peaking and intermediate power sources are needed today in many areas of the developing world. India, Egypt, and South Africa are locations that appear to be ideally suited for power tower development. As the technology matures, plants with up to a 400 MW rating appear feasible. As non-polluting energy sources become more favored, molten-salt power towers will have a high value because the thermal energy storage allows the plant to be dispatch able. Consequently, the value of power is worth more because a power tower plant can deliver energy during peak load times when it is more valuable. Energy storage also allows power tower plants to be designed and built with a range of annual capacity factors (20 to 65%). Combining high capacity factors and the fact that energy storage will allow power to be brought onto the grid in a controlled manner (i.e., by reducing electrical transients thus increasing the stability of the overall utility grid); total market penetration should be much higher than an intermittent solar technology without storage. One possible concern with the technology is the relatively high amount of land and water usage. This may become an important issue from a practical and environmental viewpoint since these plants are typically deployed within desert areas that often lack water and have fragile landscapes. Water usage at power towers is comparable to other Ranking cycle power technologies of similar size and annual performance. Land usage, although significant, is typically much less than that required for hydro [3] and is generally less than that required for fossil (e.g., oil, coal, natural gas), when the mining and exploration of land are include\\n1.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:                                  \\nSolar power towers generate electric power from sunlight by focusing concentrated solar radiation on a tower-mounted heat exchanger (receiver). The system uses hundreds to thousands of sun-tracking mirrors called heliostats to reflect the incident sunlight onto the receiver. These plants are best suited for utility-scale applications in the 30 to 400 MWe range. In a molten-salt solar power tower, liquid salt at 290ºC is pumped from a ‘cold’ storage tank through the receiver where it is heated to 565ºC and then on to a ‘hot’ tank for storage. When power is needed from the plant, hot salt is pumped to a steam generating system that produces superheated steam for a conventional Rankin cycle turbine/generator system. From the steam generator, the salt is returned to the cold tank where it is stored and eventually reheated in the receiver. Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of the primary flow paths in a molten-salt solar power plant. Determining the optimum storage size to meet power-dispatch requirements is an important part of the system design process. Storage tanks can be designed with sufficient capacity to power a turbine at full output for up to 13 hours. \\nThe heliostat field that surrounds the tower is laid out to optimize the annual performance of the plant. The field and the receiver are also sized depending on the needs of the utility. In a typical installation, solar energy collection occurs at a rate that exceeds the maximum required to provide steam to the turbine. Consequently, the thermal storage system can be charged at the same time that the plant is producing power at full capacity. The ratio of the thermal power provided by the collector system (the heliostat field and receiver) to the peak thermal power required by the turbine generator is called the solar multiple.\\n\\nFigure 1: SYSTEMS LAY OUT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. RANKINE CYCLE:\\nThere are four processes in the Rankine cycle, each changing the state of the working fluid. These states are identified by number in the diagram above.\\n \\n•	Process 4-1: First, the working fluid is pumped (ideally isentropic ally) from low to high pressure by a pump. Pumping requires a power input (for example mechanical or electrical). \\n•	Process 1-2: The high pressure liquid enters a boiler where it is heated at constant pressure by an external heat source to become a superheated vapor. Common heat sources for power plant systems are coal, natural gas, or nuclear power. \\n•	Process 2-3: The superheated vapjor expands through a turbine to generate power output. Ideally, this expansion is isentropic. This decreases the temperature and pressure of the vapor. \\n•	Process 3-4: The vapor then enters a condenser where it is cooled to become a saturated liquid. This liquid then re-enters the pump and the cycle repeats. 	\\n  Rankin cycles describe the operation of steam heat engines commonly found in power generation plants. In such vapor power plants, power is generated by alternately vaporizing and condensing a working fluid (in many cases water, although refrigerants such as ammonia may also be used).\\nThe working fluid in a Rankine cycle follows a closed loop and is re-used constantly. Water vapor seen billowing from power plants is evaporating cooling water, not working fluid.\\n                                     \\n3. HELIOSTAT:\\nIt comes from Helios, the Greek word for sun and stat, as in stationary.\\n 	 A Heliostat is a device that tracks the movement of the sun. It is typically used to orient a mirror, throughout the day, to reflect sunlight in a consistent direction. When coupled together in sufficient quantities, the reflected sunlight from the heliostats can generate an enormous amount of heat if all are oriented towards the same target. It was originally developed as an instrument for use in surveying, allowing the accurate observation of a known point from a distance. Heliostats have been used for sunlight-powered interior lighting, solar observatories, and solar power generation. Mirrors and reflective surfaces used in solar power that do not track the sun are not heliostats.\\n \\n    	 The simplest heliostat devices use a clockwork mechanism to turn the mirror in synchronization with the rotation of the Earth. More complex devices need to compensate for the changing elevation of the Sun throughout a Solar year. Even more advanced heliostats track the sun directly by sensing its position throughout the day.\\n        The heliostat reflects the sunlight onto the transmission system. This is typically a set of mirrors that direct the reflected sunlight into the building or, alternatively, a light tube. Fiber optic cabling has also been used as a transfer mechanism. Various forms of commercial products have been designed for the point of termination (the "light bulb").\\n4. WORKING OF SOLAR TOWER:\\n       	Solar power towers consist of a large field of sun-tracking mirrors, called heliostats, which focus solar energy on a receiver atop a centrally located tower. The enormous amount of energy, coming out of the sun rays, concentrated at one point (the tower in the middle), produces temperatures of approx. 550°C to 1500°C. The gained thermal energy can be used for heating water or molten salt, which saves the energy for later use. Heatened water gets to steam, which is used to move the turbine-generator. This way thermal energy is converted into electricity. \\n       	As already mentioned there are two main fluids which are used for the heat transfer, water and molten salt. Water for example is the oldest and simplest way for heat transfer. But the difference is that the method in which molten salt is used, allows storing the heat for the terms when the sun is behind clouds or even at night. Molten salt - better: the heat of it - can be used until the next dawn when the sun will be back to heat the cooled down salt again. \\n     	The molten salt consists of 60% sodium nitrate a 40% potassium nitrate (saltpeter). The salt melts at about 700°C and is liquid at approx. 1000°C; it will be kept in an insulated storage tank until the time, when it will be needed for heating up the water in the steam generator. His way of energy storage has an efficiency of approx. 99%, i.e. due to the imperfect insulation 1% of the stored energy gets lost. \\n\\n\\n5. SOLAR ONE:\\n    	Solar One, which operated from 1982 to 1988, was the world’s largest power tower plant. It proved that large-scale power production with power towers was feasible. In that plant, water was converted to steam in the receiver and used directly to power a conventional Rankine-cycle steam turbine. The heliostat field consisted of 1818 heliostats of 39.3 m reflective area each. The project met most of its technical objectives by demonstrating\\n            (1) The feasibility of 2 generating power with a power tower\\n            (2) The ability to generate 10 MW for eight hours a day at summer solstice and  four hours a day near winter solstice.\\n     	  During its final year of operation, Solar One’s availability during hours of sunshine was 96% and its annual efficiency was about 7%. \\nThe Solar One thermal storage system stored heat from solar-produced steam in a tank filled with rocks and sand using oil as the heat-transfer fluid. The system extended the plant’s power-generation capability into the night and provided heat for generating low-grade steam for keeping parts of the plant warm during off-hours and for morning startup. Unfortunately, the storage system was complex and thermodynamically inefficient. While Solar One successfully demonstrated power tower technology, it also revealed the disadvantages of a water/steam system, such as the intermittent operation of the turbine due to cloud transience and lack of effective thermal storage.\\n \\n During the operation of Solar One, research began on the more advanced molten-salt power tower design described previously. This development culminated in the Solar Two project.                              \\n6. SOLAR TWO:\\n     	The goals of the redesigned plant, called Solar Two, are to validate nitrate salt technology, to reduce the technical and Economic risk of power towers, and to stimulate the commercialization of power tower technology. Solar Two has produced 10 MW of electricity with enough thermal storage to continue to operate the turbine at full capacity for three hours after the sun has set. Long-term reliability is next to being proven.\\n \\nThe conversion of Solar One to Solar Two required a new molten-salt heat transfer system including the receiver, thermal storage, piping, and a steam generator and a new control system. The Solar One heliostat field, the tower, and the turbine/generator required only minimal modifications. The Solar Two receiver comprises a series of panels (each made of 32 thin-walled, stainless steel tubes) through which the molten salt flows in a serpentine path. The panels form a cylindrical shell surrounding piping, structural supports, and control equipment. The external surfaces of the tubes are coated with a black Pyromark paint that is robust, resistant to high temperatures and thermal cycling, and absorbs 95% of the incident sunlight. The receiver design has been optimized to absorb a maximum amount of solar energy while reducing the heat losses due to convection and radiation. The design, which includes laser-welding, sophisticated tube-nozzle-header connections, a tube clip design that facilitates tube expansion and contraction, and non-contact flux measurement devices, allows the receiver to rapidly change temperature without being damaged Solar Two is designed with a minimum number of casketed flanges and most instrument transducers, valves, and fittings are welded in place.\\n 	The energy storage system for Solar Two consists of two 875,000 liter storage tanks which were fabricated on-site by Pitt-Des Moines. The tanks are externally insulated and constructed of stainless steel and carbon steel for the hot and cold tanks, respectively. Thermal capacity of the system is 110 MWh. A natural convection cooling system is used t in the foundation of each tank to minimize overheating and excessive dehydration of the underlying soil. \\nAll pipes, valves, and vessels for hot salt were constructed from stainless steel because of its corrosion resistance in the molten-salt environment. The cold-salt system is made from mild carbon steel. The steam generator system (SGS) heat exchangers, which were constructed by ABB Lummus, consist of a shell-and-tube super heater, a kettle boiler, and a shell-and-tube preheater. Stainless steel cantilever pumps transport salt from the hot-tank-pump sump through the SGS to the cold tank. Salt in the cold tank is pumped with multi-stage centrifugal pumps up the tower to the receiver. Solar Two is expected to begin routine daily power production in late 1997. Initial data collected at the plant show that the molten-salt receiver and thermal storage tanks should perform as predicted during design.\\n\\n\\n\\n7. LAND, WATER, AND CRITICAL MATERIALS REQUIREMENTS:\\n    	The land and water use values provided in Table 4 apply to the solar portion of the power plant. Land use in 1997 is taken from Solar Two design documents. Land use for years 2000 and beyond is based on systems studies. The proper way to express land use for systems with storage is ha/MWh/yr. Expressing land use in units of ha/MW is meaningless to a solar plant with energy storage because the effect of plant capacity factor is lost. Water use measured at the SEGS VI and VII [20] trough plants form the basis of these estimates. Wet cooling towers are assumed. Water usage at Solar Two should be somewhat higher than at SEGS VI and VII due to a lower power block efficiency at Solar Two (33% gross). However, starting in the year 2000, water usage in a commercial power tower plant, with a high efficiency power block (42% gross), should be about 20% less than SEGS VI and VII. If adequate water is not available at the power plant site, a dry condenser-cooling system could possibly be used. Dry cooling can reduce water needs by as much as 90%. However, if dry cooling is employed, cost and performance penalties are expected to raise level zed-energy costs by at least 10%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8. CONCENTRATING SOLAR POWER TECHNOLOGIES:\\nCSP technologies are usually categorized in three different concepts: troughs, towers and dishes. Their main characteristics are as follows:\\n	Troughs: parabolic trough-shaped mirror reflectors linearly concentrate sunlight on to receiver tubes, heating a thermal transfer fluid which is then used to produce superheated steam. This is currently the most mature concentrating solar technology, benefiting from the accumulated experience of the 354 MWe of capacity built since the mid 1980s.\\n \\n	Towers: Central receivers use numerous heliostats to concentrate sunlight on to a central receiver on the top of a tower. With two dimensions of concentration solar towers can reach higher temperature and may offer higher Carnot conversion efficiencies.\\n \\n	Dishes: Parabolic dish-shaped reflectors perfectly concentrate sunlight in two dimensions, reaching the highest concentration ratios. They can run a small engine or turbine at the focal point. They are best suited for decentralised power supply and remote systems.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n 9. SOLAR POWER APPLICATIONS:\\n     	  Several kinds of very practical solar energy systems are in use today. The two most common are passive solar heated homes (or small buildings), and small stand-alone photovoltaic (solar electric) systems. These two applications of solar energy have proven themselves popular over a decade of use. They also illustrate the two basic methods of harnessing solar energy: solar thermal systems, and solar electric systems. The solar thermal systems convert the radiant energy of the sun into heat, and then use that heat energy as desired. The solar electric systems convert the radiant energy of the sun directly into electrical energy, which can then be used as most electrical energy is used today.
'''The Coping Project''' is child-centered research that aims to investigate the characteristics of children with imprisoned parents, their resilience, and their vulnerability to mental health problems. Over the period of the next three years, the study will cover four countries (UK, Germany, Sweden and Romania). The findings, however, are expected to have European-wide and international application. \\n\\nThe COPING research strategy’s innovative approach places the clearest emphasis on knowledge obtained directly from children and young people. Total survey sample will be 800 interviews, 200 children with an imprisoned parent in each of the four countries. \\n\\nThe Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale will be used to ascertain coping strategies and mental health problems for these young people; results subsequently will be compared with normative population samples. Smaller groups of children and parents will be involved in qualitative interviews to explore the impact of parental imprisonment and support services available in greater detail. Further available intervention services to support these families will be comprehensively mapped.
     Open water swimming was added as a formal competitive event to the 2008 Olympic Games (Beijing) and is being introduced more and more into our lifestyle. Many open water areas including rivers, reservoirs, and oceans, have been used as open water swimming venues. However, we must also recognize the safety problems of open water swimming. Together, we would like to create a safe and pleasant swimming environment for open water swimming. The safety problems of open water swimming have existed as long as we can remember. In an investigation of accident casualty, the death rate in open water has been ranked as the second largest factor next to traffic accidents. Drowning accidents in China have occurred mainly in public areas, with an annual death rate of around ten thousand people, including experienced swimmers. You should be concerned with the safety of yourself and your family and never depend on others to save you or the people you love. \\n        In order to avoid the accidents when people are swimming on the open water such as ocean,lake,river,etc, we recommend a safe swimming device called safe swimming ball (SSB), which we bought from Shenzhen Quantum Trade Co.,Ltd (mail to : quantumtrd.ltd at gmail.com ),you can refer to below pictures .\\n\\n[[C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\桌面\产品图片\3991303_orig.jpg]]
This is the true story of four friends trying to prepare for the worst, reconnect with a more sustainable tradition, and appreciate the final days of this incredible (both good and bad) society we have created. The story will document our attempts to learn how to survive whatever might happen on Dec. 21; our successes and failures, and all the fun we have along the way.\\n\\nWe are not doomsday crazy people, but believe that change is inevitable. We acknowledge that end of the world prophecies have a long history of turning out to be incorrect — in fact, their rate of failure, so far, is precisely 100%. However, the only thing more absurd to us than another doomsday prophecy is to maintain a resolute belief in unabashed, unsustainable progress.\\n\\nWorst case scenario: we are wrong on all accounts and the world doesn’t end and society as we know it remains intact. If this turns out to be the case, then we will have spent the year getting the most out of life, living as if there were no tomorrow, all-the-while reacquainting ourselves with the knowledge and skills of our ancestors.

Though her experience is mostly with children with disabilities, the recommendations Keri shares on this website, are toys that she believes can be helpful for any child to stimulate educational growth, so as to achieve developmental milestones in a fun, playful and natural way.
21st Century Network was set up to discuss some of the great issues of our millennium and bring back the hope that we can do something about it. This is a group for those who believe that we need to develop a new form of humanism that includes people of all religions and none but who embrace humanistic values as the basis of their actions. These are values of global compassion, personal self-discovery, shared development, planetary concern and a love of community. One commentator states,\\n\\n"I think this group has the potential to make a very important contribution on a number of global challenges that are and will affect our lives in the future. By inviting members of the public, NGO practicioners, policy makers and government representatives to these meetings the group could become an important think tank on a number of issues fostering important linkages between the state and civil society in Britain and beyond. Join this group and be part of this process."
== it training and development center ==\\n\\nTill the recent past it was believed that premier education is not available in India, but the current development in the educational sector has led to the belief that quality education is indeed available in India. Research done in the past has highlighted loopholes in the curriculum and methodologies but these criticisms had acted upon and amendments were made. These included changes in the syllabus, introduction of new courses and dynamic methodologies. Modern infrastructures and teachers with adequate training are facilitating cutting-edge delivery of content; connected E-learning (called C- learning) is in vogue and today, India is attracting students from South Africa, China, Canada, France, Germany, Canada, Australia, UK and USA. \\n\\nThis unbelievable progress in the educational scenario also includes low costs of tuitions as compared to the western countries. The basic divisions in the academics include primary, secondary, senior secondary and higher education. Elementary education is till standard 8 while secondary and higher secondary education consists two years each. Graduation is between three to five years depending on the course after which there is an option for post-graduation (a two-year course) and research.\\n\\nhttp://www.itinstituteindelhi.com

== Mold in florida ==\\n \\n\\nFlorida is one of mold favorite places to live in. Although molds can be found anywhere, mold relies on humid environments, or moisture and a food source such as building materials, dust, wood, paper and organic materials. Most mold types are likely to grow on a porous surface with high moisture content within the first 24-48 hours.\\n\\nA tremendous percentage of all the properties in the state of Florida face some kind of moisture problem, many of those are a result from hurricane damages causing water intrusion in the property, many of those homes with water damages worsen during the period with no electricity, those thousands of homes with no power for a prolonged period of time are unable to run their air conditioner systems and properly remove humidity.\\n\\nProper maintenance and functioning of your A/C system is crucial for a healthy indoor environment, having your A/C unit serviced on regular basis may prevent you from a lot headaches in regards to mold.\\nWhen an A/C system is not functioning properly, weather is not cooling enough or no removing the humidity like it should, condensation problems may occur. Air conditioner systems should be one of the most important things to inspect during a mold inspection since this possible contamination is being spread out among the entire property possibly triggering allergic reactions, upper respiratory problems and many health hazards to those occupants susceptible to mold exposure.\\n\\nIndoor air quality assessments in Florida such as mold testing, mold inspections and even mold remediation or removal have become a multi million dollar industry in the past few years due to all the media hype, newer studies on mold exposure and recent hurricane activity. Because of this dramatic growth in the industry a lot of companies have been taking advantage of this demand, and the fact that no laws, regulations or specific protocols for mold testing and or mold removal have been passed. When choosing a mold testing company this are the things you should look for:\\n\\n•	No conflict of interest ( do not use a company that does both remediation and testing) \\n\\n•	Look for companies that use the latest in technology such particle counters, infrared thermal cameras, moisture meters…\\n\\n•	Make sure they are certified indoor environmentalist or at least certified mold inspectors. \\n \\n•	Make sure they inspect the A/C system, attic, exterior, behind pluming fixtures, and moisture detection among entire property. Having a specific area tested with out investigation and environmental testing on the rest of the property is no on your best interest (a lot findings are not visible to the naked eye) that is why top of line equipment must be used.\\n\\n•	Pick a company that uses a accredited laboratory\\n\\n•	Make sure they provide a comprehensive report and lab results interpretation for a better understanding of the results and findings.\\n\\nMartin Yerfino--[[User:Emyerfo|Emyerfo]] 20:07, 10 May 2007 (UTC)\\n\\n[http://www.MoldTestingFlorida.com]\\n[http://www.EcoTechUs.com]
==Fungus==\\n===Conservation===\\nKnowledge of the conservation status of fungi is currently very limited. Only fifteen species of fungi have been fully evaluated by the World Conservation Union, but at least half of them are considered threatend.<ref>[http://www.iucnredlist.org/documents/2008RL_stats_table_1_v1223294385.pdf World Conservation Union Red List]</ref> This is because fungi are more diverse than   plants and animals. Many fungi currently classified cannot be seen by the naked eye—making evaluation difficult. Most  fungi live underground or within the bodies of other organisms. It is possible to  count the population of fungal species by counting the number of fruiting bodies, but this method is highly inaccurate. It is important to realize that the fruiting bodies of fungi do not represent the whole organism, but rather that part of the fungus responsible for reproduction. Also, each hyphae of the mycelium of a species of fungus can produce a fruiting body<ref>Rebecca Stefoff(2008), ''Fungus Kingdom'', Marshall Cavendish Benchmark.</ref>, so the visible parts counted could just be  one part of a singular organism.\\n\\nMycologist who study fungi suggest that the practice of  harvesting fungi should not threaten fungal populations, since any one member of a species is capable of producing numerous fruiting bodies. But some countries  have started to control  collecting. The most devastating damage likely to be inflicted on the fungal population is destruction of their habitat, which causes competition between resources and threatens  less adapted species with extinction. The destruction of  plant populations can also affect fungi, because many fungi form symbiotic relationships with them, and rely on them for survival.
Special Dream\\n- After the death of a loved one\\n\\nA level four dream of a friend or loved one after they have died. This type of dream experience is described as intense but natural. The dreamer is fully aware of the encounter as it taps deep into the emotions within the relationships that bind the human spirit with the deceased person.  The majority of people who have a special dream only experience one type, which is the visual experience of the deceased person.  Others had the visual but could also engage in conversation and a small portion experienced multiple sensory contacts during the special dream, including the sense of touch and smell.  There is no explanation as to why the dreams differ from one person to another and why the deceased could speak or could be touched, when others could not. \\nMost people have this dream experience only once, but a few reported having more then one experience either with the same person twice or two different dreams involving two different people.   Research shows the dream experience usually takes place within a small window of time, most often right after the death and shows no boundaries or limitations in regards to the receiver’s age, sex, race or religion.  The dream experience happens regardless how the person died. Accidents, natural causes, diseases or suicide were all included.  Special dreams are experienced in a natural sleep state, and not under any influence of hypnosis, alcohol or mind altering drugs. The dream encounter occurs without prior warning or knowledge and lasts only a short time. No matter how much anyone may want to see a deceased person, or how open they are to the spiritual world, these encounters are rare and only occur if granted by a higher power. \\n\\nwww.specialdream.org
== Bad Use of 3D ==\\n\\n\\nBad Use of 3D\\n\\nMost abstract information spaces work poorly in 3D because they are non-physical. If anything, they have at least a hundred dimensions, so visualizing an information space in 3D means throwing away 97 dimensions instead of 98: hardly a big enough improvement to justify the added interface complexity. In particular, navigation through a hyperspace (such as a website) is often very confusing in 3D, and users frequently get lost. 3D navigation looks very cool in a demo, but that's because you are not flying through the hyperspace yourself. Thus, you don't have to remember what's behind you or worry about what remote objects are hidden by near-by objects. The person giving the demo knows where everything is (the first law of demos: never try to actually use the system for anything; simply step through a well-rehearsed script that does not touch anything that might cause a crash). Avoid virtual reality gimmicks (say, a virtual shopping mall) that emulate the physical world. The goal of Web design is to be better than reality. If you ask users to "walk around the mall", you are putting your interface in the way of their goal. In the physical world, you need to schlep between shops; on the Web you teleport through cyberspace directly to your destination using a navigational topology that conforms to user needs (assuming good information architecture, of course).\\n\\njean paul 13:52, 15 April 2010 (UTC)jean paul

{{Multiple issues|\\n{{More footnotes|date=July 2009}}\\n{{Globalize|date=October 2011}}\\n}}\\n\\nUnder [[United States]] law, pesticide misuse is considered to be the use of a [[pesticide]] in a way that violates laws regulating their use or endangers humans or the environment; many of these regulations are laid out in the [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]] (FIFRA). Pesticide misuse encompasses a range of practices, including overapplication, incorrect timing, and the use of banned substances. This global issue not only threatens environmental safety but also undermines efforts towards sustainability. The risk of pesticide pollution at a global scale necessitates a concerted effort to understand and mitigate misuse. The most common instances of pesticide misuse are applications inconsistent with the labeling, which can include the use of a material in any way not described on the label, changing dosage rates, or violating specific safety instructions. Pesticide labels have been criticized as a poor [[risk communication]] vehicle, leading some officials and researchers to question whether "misuse" is an appropriate term for what are often "unintended uses" resulting from a poor understanding of safety and application instructions. Other kinds of pesticide misuse include the sale or use of an unregistered pesticide or one whose registration has been revoked and the sale or use of an adulterated or misbranded pesticide. Under most jurisdictions, it is illegal to alter or remove pesticide labels, to sell [[restricted pesticides]] to an uncertified applicator, or to fail to maintain sales and use records of restricted pesticides. \\n\\nPesticides are toxic compounds, and their labels are specifically designed to encourage safe and effective use. Ignoring the directions can lead to civil and criminal charges and civil liability for damages to other parties.\\n\\n== Health effects ==\\n{{Main|Health effects of pesticides}}\\n\\n=== In humans ===\\nPesticide misuse can lead to [[pesticide poisoning]], the consequences of which range from mild skin irritations to seizure to death. The effects of poisoning vary drastically depending on dosage and levels of exposure. The types of pesticides most often present in poisonings are [[organophosphate]]s and N-methyl carbamates, [[pyrethrin]] and synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, and [[organochloride]] insecticides. Certain fumigants, nematicides, herbicides, and dipyridyls are also common in cases of pesticide poisoning.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=O'Malley |first1=Michael |title=Clinical evaluation of pesticide exposure and poisonings |journal=The Lancet |date=April 1997 |volume=349 |issue=9059 |pages=1161–1166 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(96)07222-4 |pmid=9113024 |s2cid=28511066 }}</ref>\\n\\nOne of the best known cases of pesticide misuse in recent history involved the application of a pesticide intended for outdoor agricultural use ([[Parathion methyl|methyl parathion]]) to homes in Mississippi for cockroaches and other home pests.

A number of residents, including two infants, suffered symptoms of [[pesticide poisoning]]. A number of homes and business, including several day care centers and schools were rendered uninhabitable or unusable. Heavy fines and prison terms followed for the perpetrators.<ref>{{cite news |title=Exterminators Held in Use Of a Poison Inside Homes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/17/us/exterminators-held-in-use-of-a-poison-inside-homes.html |work=The New York Times |date=17 November 1996 }}</ref>\\n\\n===In other animals===\\n\\nPesticide misuse can also endanger wildlife and other environmental resources.\\n\\nBirds\\nBirds are particularly susceptible to pesticide exposure. Certain pesticides, such as organophosphates and carbamates, interfere with the nervous systems of birds, leading to reduced reproductive success and increased mortality rates. The thinning of eggshells caused by DDT, a now-banned pesticide, is a well-documented example. This phenomenon led to a decline in the populations of several bird species, including the bald eagle and peregrine falcon.\\n\\nMammals\\nMammals can also suffer from pesticide exposure. Rodents and other small mammals are at risk of ingesting pesticides directly or through contaminated food sources. This can result in acute poisoning or chronic health issues, such as reproductive and developmental problems. Predatory mammals, such as foxes and weasels, can be indirectly affected through bioaccumulation, where they consume prey that has been exposed to pesticides.\\n\\nInsects\\nBeneficial insects, including pollinators like bees and butterflies, are highly vulnerable to pesticides. Neonicotinoids, a class of insecticides, have been linked to the decline of bee populations due to their neurotoxic effects. These pesticides impair foraging behavior, reduce reproductive success, and increase susceptibility to diseases and parasites. The decline in pollinator populations poses a significant threat to biodiversity and agriculture.\\n\\nAquatic Life\\nAquatic animals are impacted by pesticide runoff from agricultural fields and urban areas. Fish and amphibians are particularly at risk as pesticides can contaminate water bodies, leading to lethal and sublethal effects. Pesticides can disrupt the endocrine systems of fish, affecting their growth, reproduction, and development. Amphibians, which have permeable skin, are highly sensitive to waterborne pesticides, leading to population declines and deformities.\\n\\nReptiles\\nReptiles, such as snakes and lizards, can also be affected by pesticide exposure. These animals may encounter pesticides through direct contact with treated areas or by consuming contaminated prey. The impacts on reptiles can include decreased fertility, altered behavior, and increased mortality rates. \\n\\n'''Notable Instance of Pesticide misuse:''' A Florida man was recently cited and fined $23,100 for using the pesticide Aldicarb on deer carcasses to kill coyotes, for storing the pesticide in unlabeled containers, and not being a certified applicator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdal/pr/florida-men-sentenced-poisoning-wildlife-and-hunting-dogs-bullock-county|title=Florida Men Sentenced for Poisoning Wildlife and Hunting Dogs in Bullock County|date=30 April 2015 }}</ref>\\n\\nSpecific label directions are given on materials that are [[Pesticide (toxic to bees)|toxic to bee]]s, because these pollinators are considered an important environmental resource. A typical bee-protection label direction reads: "This product is highly toxic to bees exposed to direct treatment on blooming crops or weeds. Do not apply this product or allow it to drift to blooming crops or weeds if bees are visiting the treatment area."<ref name="Ellis-et-al-2021" /> In 2013, over 25,000 bumblebees died as a result of pesticide misuse in Wilsonville, Oregon.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://portlandtribune.com/cr/24-news/155022-massive-bee-die-off-found-in-wilsonville | title=Massive bee die-off found in Wilsonville | access-date=2013-06-30 | archive-date=2021-03-01 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210301155027/https://pamplinmedia.com/cr/24-news/155022-massive-bee-die-off-found-in-wilsonville | url-status=dead }}</ref> A South Carolina farmer was also cited and fined for pesticide misuse, because he sprayed a blooming cucumber field while bees were foraging on the blossoms, causing a serious [[Diseases of the honeybee#Pesticide losses|bee kill]]. Similar bee kills have impacted US beekeepers and the growers who need bees for pollination billions of dollars in losses. Efforts to curb pesticide misuse are critical, especially in agricultural countries where literacy barriers and lack of training contribute significantly to the problem. Programs like Integrated Pest Management (IPM) training have shown promise in reducing misuse and enhancing crop yields.\\n\\n== Contributing factors ==\\nPesticide misuse occurs most frequently in developing countries and in countries with predominantly agricultural economies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Goldberg |first1=Karen A. |title=Efforts to Prevent Misuse of Pesticides Exported to Developing Countries: Progressing Beyond Regulation and Notification |journal=Ecology Law Quarterly |date=1985 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=1025–1051 |jstor=24112835 }}</ref> Several factors contribute to pesticide misuse, but ecological researchers have found language barriers and illiteracy to be among the most common. [[Safety data sheet]]s for pesticides are available in a variety of languages, but the farmers and agricultural workers who are responsible for pesticide application are often unable to read them. Limited education and a lack of proper training tend to be among the most significant contributing factors to improper handling and application of pesticides. The majority of agricultural workers and rural farmers in developing countries have received only a few years of primary education, which contributes to the illiteracy of these populations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Akter |first1=Mousumi |last2=Fan |first2=Liangxin |last3=Rahman |first3=Md Mokhlesur |last4=Geissen |first4=Violette |last5=Ritsema |first5=Coen J. |title=Vegetable farmers' behaviour and knowledge related to pesticide use and related health problems: A case study from Bangladesh |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |date=November 2018 |volume=200 |pages=122–133 |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.130 |s2cid=158629020 }}</ref> Farmers in underdeveloped countries also frequently misuse pesticides due to improper training; however, [[Integrated pest management|Integrated Pest Management]] training has been shown to reduce rates of improper handling and application of pesticides while simultaneously increasing crop yields.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gautam |first1=Shriniwas |last2=Schreinemachers |first2=Pepijn |last3=Uddin |first3=Md.

Just a guy that studies and researches medicinal and psychoactive plants of all types. I have traveled all over the world seeking knowledge from shamans, medicine men and (so called) witch doctors to learn more about these plants that have been used before history was written. I am glad to help the Wikipedia project acquire additional information and prosper as the preferred source of academic information.\\n\\nNot so concerned with Wikipedia badges or awards, just glad to have the opportunity to correct and improve some articles that interest me or that are inadequate. I am a good author at least better than some, thought Wikipedia could fill my time slot and make my free time more interesting and worthwhile. \\n\\nI am especially interested in new and emerging ideals and topics like global citizenship, globalization, the New World Order and other things that are unexplainable and disconcerting to most.
