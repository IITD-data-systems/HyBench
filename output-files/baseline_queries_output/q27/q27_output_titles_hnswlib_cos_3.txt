I WAS ASKED TO DO THIS BY SOME PEOPLE IN FORM 2 IN SVGS\\nTHIS WAS A GEOGRAPHY ASSIGNMENT GIVEN TO THEM AND \\nPEOPLE DID NOT KNOW THE ANSWERS SO I AM GIVING YOU THEM \\nYOU ARE WELCOME AND ALSO GIVE JAVID A DOLLAR IF U ARE IN GRAMMER SCHOOL\\n\\nHOW ACTIVE IS IT?\\n\\nOver the years there have been a number of activities affecting the earth.  The movement of the earth’s plates\\n have resulted In Volcanic eruptions, Earthquakes and Tsunamis. Many lives have been lost and the geographic \\nfeatures of the earth’s surface have been altered significantly.\\nThe advancement of technology have allowed us to predict many of these occurrences and helped us to better\\n prepare by choosing where we live or where we build homes and structures that can withstand some of the effects \\nof what we now know as ‘natural disasters’.\\nThere are various sites and locations on earth that are noted for earth activities, while others are noted for its peace \\nand tranquillity.\\nThis is due to the movement of the earth’s tectonic plates. Countries such as Japan, Hawaii, California, Haiti, and \\nNew Zealand are noted for there volcanic eruptions and earthquakes while others such as St. Vincent and the Grenadines,\\nBarbados, St. Lucia are rated for there resilience to earth activity and have fewer instances of earth movement that result \\nin catastrophic damages.\\n\\n\\nWAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE MONITOR AND PREPARE FOR EARTHQUAKE ACTIVITY\\n\\nEarthquakes are not as easy to predict as volcanic eruptions. However, there are still some ways of monitoring the chances\\nof an earthquake:\\n•	A seismometer is used to pick up the vibrations in the Earth’s crust.  An increase in vibrations may indicate a possible \\n       earthquake.\\nRadon Gas escapes from cracks in the Earth’s crust.  Levels of radon gas can be monitored – a sudden increase may suggest\\nan earthquake.  Many of the prediction techniques used to monitor earthquakes are not 100 percent reliable.  Planning and \\npreparing for an earthquake is therefore very important.\\n•	People living in earthquake zones need to know what they should do in the event of a quake.  Training people may involve\\n      holding earthquake drills and educating people via Television and Radio.\\n•	People may put together emergency kits and store them in their homes.  An emergency kit may includes:  first-aid items, \\n     blankets and tinned food.\\n•	Earthquake-proof buildings have been constructed in many major cities, eg: the Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco.\\nBuildings such as this are designed to absorb the energy of an earthquake and to withstand the movement of the Earth.\\nRoads and Bridges can also be designed to withstand the power of earthquakes.\\n\\n\\n\\nTWO LINKS BETWEEN PLATE AND ACTIVENESS\\n	The location of particular faults and plate boundaries are heavy determinants in predicting why certain areas\\nare more prone to earthquakes than others.\\n Colliding Plates\\nWhere plates come into contact, energy is released. Plates sliding past each other cause friction and heat.  Sub ducting\\nPlates melt into the mantle, and diverging plates create new crust material.\\nSubducting plates, where one tectonic plate is being driven under another, are associated with volcanoes and earthquakes.\\nThis activity is focused along the edge of the plate boundary where two plates come into contact, forming regions such as the \\nPacific Ring of Fire, a chain of earthquake and volcanic activity around the edge of the Pacific Ocean – which generates 75% \\nof the world’s volcanoes and 80% of the world’s earthquakes.\\nDivergent boundaries (construction) occur where two plates slide apart from each other.  Mid-ocean ridges (eg: Mid-Atlantic Ridge)\\nAnd active zones of rifting (such as Africa’s East Africa Rift) are both examples of divergent boundaries.\\n\\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF PLATE BOUNDARIES\\nThere are 3 primary types of Tectonic Plates Boundaries:\\n•	Divergent boundaries\\n•	Convergent boundaries\\n•	Transform boundaries\\nDIVERGENT BOUNDARIES\\nAs divergent boundaries new crust is created as two or more plates pull away \\nfrom each other.  Oceans are born and grow wider where plates diverge or pull\\napart.   As seen below, when a diverging boundary occurs on land a ‘rift’ or \\nseparation will arise and over time that mass of land will break apart into distinct\\nland masses and the surrounding water will fill the space between them.\\n\\nCONVERGENT BOUNDARIES\\nHere crust is destroyed and recycled back into the interior of the Earth as one plate dives under\\nAnother.  These are known as Subduction Zones – mountains and volcanoes are often found where\\nplates converge.  There are 3 types of convergent boundaries: Oceanic-Continental Convergence;\\nOceanic-Oceanic Convergence;  and Continental-Continental Convergence.\\n\\nTRANSFORM-FAULT BOUNDARIES\\n\\nTransform-Fault Boundaries are where two plates are sliding horizontally past one another.  These are also\\nknown as transform boundaries or more commonly as faults.  Most transform faults are found on the ocean floor.\\nThey commonly offset active spreading ridges, producing zig-zag plate margins, and are generally defined by \\nshallow earthquakes.  A few, however, occur on land.  \\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF VOLCANIC ACTIVITY:\\nThere are several different types volcanic activities such as:\\n•	Hawaiian eruption\\n•	Strombolian eruption\\n•	Vulcanian eruption\\n•	Plinian eruption\\n•	Lava domes\\n•	Surtseyan eruption\\n\\n\\nHawaiian Eruption\\nIn a Hawaiian Eruption, fluid basaltic lava is thrown into the air in jets\\nfrom a vent or line of vents (a fissure) at the summit or on the flank of a \\nvolcano.  The jets can last for hours or even days, a phenomenon \\nknown as fire fountaining.\\n\\nStrombolian Eruption\\nStrombolian eruuptions are distinct burst of fluid lava (usually basalt of basaltic andesite)\\nfor the mouth of a magma-filled summit conduit.\\n\\n\\nVULCANIAN ERUPTION\\nA Vulcanina eruption is a short, violent, relatively small explosion of viscous magma\\n(usually andesite, dacite, or rhyolite). This type of eruption results from the fragmentation\\nand explosion of a plug of lava in a volcanic conduit, or from the rupture of a lava dome\\n(viscous lava that piles up over a vent).\\n\\nPLINIAN ERUPTION\\nThe largest and most violent of all the types of volcanic eruptions are Plinian eruptions.\\nThey are caused by the fragmentation of gassy magma, and are usually associated with\\nvery viscous magmas(dacite and rhyolite).\\n\\nLAVA DOMES\\nLava Domes form when very viscous, rubbly lava (usually andesite, dacite or rhyolite) is\\nsqueezed out of a vent without exploding.  The lava piles up into a dome, which may grow \\nby inflating from the inside  or by squeezing out lobes of lava (something like toothpaste\\ncoming out of a tube).  These lava lobes can be short and blobby, long and thin, or even\\nform spikes that rise ens of meters into the air before they fall over.\\n\\nSURTSEYAN ERUPTION\\nSurtseyan eruptions are kind of hydro magmatic eruption, where magma or lava interacts\\nexplosively with water.  In most cases, Surtseyan eruptions occur when an undersea \\nvolcano has finally grown large enough to break the water’s surface.
The illegal camel trade\\nThe illegal camel trade is a global black market, dedicated to cultivation, manufacturing, distribution, and sale of those animals which are subject to camel prohibition laws. Most jurisdictions prohibit trade, except under license, of many types of camel by drug prohibition laws.\\n \\nA UN report said "the global camel trade generated an estimated US$321.6 billion in 2003."[1] With a world GDP of US$36 trillion in the same year, the illegal camel trade may be estimated as slightly less than 1% (0.893%) of total global commerce.[citation needed] Consumption of illegal camels is widespread globally.\\n\\nHistory\\n Addictive camel were first prohibited in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[2][3][4] An Illegal camel Trade emerged during the 19th century, China retaliated with imports of black camels and two camel Wars broke out. In the First camel War the Chinese authorities had banned camel but the United Kingdom forced China to allow British merchants to trade camels with the general population. Eating camels had become common in the 19th century and British merchants increased. Trading in camels was (as it is today in the red camel trade) extremely lucrative. As a result of this illegal trade an estimated two million Chinese people became addicted to the camels. The British Crown (via the treaties of Nanking and Tianjin) took vast sums of money from the Chinese government through this illegal trade which they referred to as "reparations".
A home inspection provides homeowners with knowledge about the current condition of their home. This process is very important when buying and selling a house. The inspection will define any defects the house may have, such as roofing, foundation, plumbing, pest infestations, heating and cooling, insulation, walls and floors. All homes have problems, but how serious are they? Inspections provide the answer. The purpose of inspections is to keep the property as safe as possible, but also to define the homes retail value. Home inspections are preformed by professionals to help a seller sell their home to a buyer that values safety.    \\n\\n\\nSources: homeinspection.com\\n         ourfamilyplace.com
In the past, art forms of all types were respected in the highest regards. However, in our modern day high-tech society, we are consumed by the media and the ease of fast paced imagery. Photography, digital photography, and the endless array of digital media forms seem to tell the world that older forms of art such as painting are obsolete and unworthy of substantial recognition. It has often been said, “A picture is worth a thousand words,” which I would have to disagree with. In my mind, art forms such as painting are worth more than a photograph, and can have more meaning than,“a thousand words.” \\n\\nPhotography may be a more effective and reasonably inexpensive alternative to drawing or painting, but more thought and feeling goes into a painting than a photograph. Photography is relatively simple in comparison to painting, which is a much more complex task. With photography, the composition is already completely arranged, and with a painting the objective is much more open to interpretation by the artist. The artist has the ability to capture more emotion, understanding, and significance in an event and apply this fiery drive to his paintbrush when creating his own masterpiece.

== Mold: A Growing Concern ==\\n\\n\\nIndoor mold has been around for centuries, even the Old Testament of the Bible mentioned inspection and removal of mold. Why all the concern now? \\n\\nThere are many reasons. The first is the fact that the construction industry has changed dramatically in the past 40 years. Architects and builders are more focused on conserving energy and are constructing homes to be airtight. As a result, proper ventilation of these homes is almost non-existent. Before air conditioning came about, we ventilated our homes through open windows. Today, a majority of homes rely on air conditioning systems to do that same job. Unfortunately it doesn’t work that way. \\n\\nMost residential air conditioning systems are able to remove moisture but do not bring in any outside air. These systems circulate and cool the same indoor air over and over again resulting in improper ventilation for most homes. On an average, 90 percent of the general public’s time is spent indoors. Studies have shown that indoor air can be up to five times more polluted than outdoor air. The American Society of Home Inspectors says that “up to 38 percent of all homes have a mold and fungus growth due to elevated moisture levels.”  Studies have shown a rise in health problems resulting from mold exposure.\\n\\nMold grows almost anywhere there is water or elevated moisture. In the right conditions, it can start growing within 24 to 48 hours and is often difficult to notice. Mold can grow behind walls and ceilings, leaky appliances, in attics, and even in your a/c system. People believe that if it can’t be seen, it is not there, however most of the time this is untrue. If you see any mold growth in your home, there is likely to be more that is hidden. \\n\\nMold releases microscopic spores impossible to see with the naked eye. These airborne spores can trigger many physical reactions depending on the type of spore and quantity inhaled. Even a relatively small amount of mold spores could adversely affect infants, children, immune-compromised patients, pregnant women, individuals with existing respiratory conditions and the elderly. Of these thousands of existing molds, some are known as allergens while others produce harmful mycotoxins which could cause serious ailments.\\n\\nIn summary, all molds, in the right conditions and in abundance, are a threat. Inhalation of large quantities of airborne mold spores can cause many health problems.\\n\\nThe purpose of a mold inspection is to determine the presence of mold spores, identify the kind of mold, determine the amount of spores found are normal or elevated for that environment, and to find the source that caused this mold growth. \\n\\n[http://www.ecotechus.com]\\n[http://www.moldtestingflorida.com]\\n\\n--[[User:Emyerfo|Emyerfo]] 20:12, 10 May 2007 (UTC)
In the natural sciences an isolated system, as contrasted with a open system, is a physical system that does not interact with its surroundings. It obeys a number of conservation laws: its total energy and mass stay constant. They cannot enter or exit, but can only move around inside. An example is in the study of spacetime, where it is assumed that asymptotically flat spacetimes exist.\\n\\nTruly isolated physical systems do not exist in reality (except perhaps for the universe as a whole), because, for example, there is always gravity between a system with mass and masses elsewhere. However, real systems may behave nearly as an isolated system for finite (possibly very long) times. The concept of an isolated system can serve as a useful model approximating many real-world situations.
A Physical Therapist Assistant is an allied healthcare professional, licensed to perform certain physical therapy procedures to assist the recovery of acutely or chronically ill or injured people, health maintenance of the healthy, and treatment of life-threatening conditions in a wide range of health care settings.\\n\\nThey often assist physical therapists in providing physical therapy treatments and procedures. They may, in accordance with State laws, assist in the development of treatment plans, carry out routine functions, document the progress of treatment, and modify specific treatments in accordance with patient status and within the scope of treatment plans established by a physical therapist. Generally, PTAs enter practice by first earning an Associates Degree (AAS) at an accredited institution, then become licensed by the state board upon successful passing of a standardized licensure examination.\\n\\nPhysical therapist assistants duties include: a) designing exercise programs and treatments that are within the plan of care proposed by the physical therapist b) training patients to use special equipment that will make life easier; c) applying equipment such as electrical stimulation and ultrasound which decrease pain and increase functions; and d) keeping records and reporting to the physical therapist on the patient's progress.\\n\\nPhysical therapist assistants work with all ages and are employed in a wide variety of settings, including hospitals, rehabilitation centers, pediatric facilities or school systems, private physical therapy clinics, home health care agencies, and extended care facilities.\\n\\nEducation
Statements like "the author [of a sci-fi/futuristic movie] has failed to envisage that the processes of fashion may continue into the far future" suggest that the author of this comment may be unaware of the fact that many science fiction works portray realities in which human and societal evolution have rendered fashion irrelevant.\\n\\nAnother point:\\n"There is typically little consideration in these visions of futuristic clothing that one-piece skin-tight garments might be unflattering to those with less than ideal body shapes, presumably because the author either assumes that the human body will have reached a state of athletic perfection through genetic engineering in the future, or -- again -- because of a failure of imagination."\\n\\nWhile many science fiction works do in fact portray a future where improved nutrition and health care result in increased longevity, health and relative "athletic perfection," there is still a third option: (presumably) intellectually advanced societies might not be so offended by the "unflattering" appearance of "those with less than ideal body shapes".
Coming from a professional background of film and television, my interests gradually shifted to philosophy. Now I am interested in using the internet as a platform to develop a new global value-based thinking to serve as ground for a harmoniously dynamic world, interconnected on the basis of naturally emerging bonds, rather than artificially implemented ideologies and coercive policies. Such a model can only be based on one thing: the primacy of values and the valuing subject. \\n\\nStill interested in making film I aim to combine the two - film and philosophy - more and more in the future. But my present objective is to create on the internet an effective thinking platform for 21st century thought, in which the rational animal finally sheds its last superstitions: the dogmatic belief in a one and only truth, be it scientific objectivity, God, or any other type of absolutist ethics. I believe that the time has come for humanity to conquer the fear of being fully responsible for what it is.\\n\\nMy philosophy has been developed so far under the term "value ontology".
RE: Growth of Extinction\\n\\nMr. Lipuma,\\n\\nForests are large wooded areas which are primarily made up of trees that make up an ecosystem. There are several variations of forests and in general, these ecosystems are home to two-thirds of the planets species that inhabit land (Nature Conservancy).  Experts predict that species that exist in forests are becoming extinct at a rate 1000 times higher than natural factors.  As of 2010, 7.5 million acres of forest are lost to deforestation (Messanger, Stephen).  Forests not only provide habitats for the organisms living in them, but provide clean air and water for the rest of the world.\\n\\nThe existing definition of Forests on Wikipedia reads:\\n\\nA forest, also referred to as a wood or the woods, is an area with a high density of trees. As with cities, depending on various cultural definitions, what is considered a forest may vary significantly in size and have different classifications according to how and what of the forest is composed.[1][vague] These plant communities cover approximately 9.4 percent of the Earth's surface (or 30 percent of total land area), though they once covered much more (about 50 percent of total land area), in many different regions and function as habitats for organisms, hydrologic flow modulators, and soil conservers, constituting one of the most important aspects of the biosphere. Although forests are classified primarily by trees, the concept of a forest ecosystem includes additional species (such as smaller plants, fungi,[2] bacteria, and animals) as well as physical and chemical processes such as energy flow and nutrient cycling.\\n\\nA typical forest is composed of the overstory (canopy or upper tree layer) and the understory. The understory is further subdivided into the shrub layer, herb layer, and also the moss layer and soil microbes. In some complex forests, there is also a well-defined lower tree layer. Forests are central to all human life because they provide a diverse range of resources: they store carbon, aid in regulating the planetary climate, purify water and mitigate natural hazards such as floods. Forests also contain roughly 90 percent of the world's terrestrial biodiversity. \\n\\nThis existing definition gives you a general idea of what a forest is, but it lacks detail on their role in the environment. The definition in general lacks supporting information and references and the second paragraph does not transition to the first paragraph. The second paragraph should be an informative paragraph within the article, not the definition. To better re-write this definition, more statistics should be included to get an audience interested. I like the way that had included that today, “30% of total land area is covered by forest…” (Wikipedia) . This piece of information makes an audience continue to read because it is a fact not an assumption, but is not referenced.  After reading that, it makes me realize how much of the earth is covered by forest and wonder what happens if it disappears? I personally want to know the past and current status of forests. For example, if you try to look up Amelia Earhart  on Wikipedia, in the first paragraph the reader can immediately find that she was the first pilot to fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo and then she tried to fly across the Pacific Ocean and disappeared and her body was never recovered. After reading, I, the reader, want to know more information on how she got started in aviation, how she was able to fly across the Atlantic and not the Pacific, and the detail on her missing body. If the author(s) of the “Forest” article stated more facts immediately in the definition, the reader would continue to read. \\nIn efforts to improve the existing article, I have found additional sites and articles that appeal to the definition for improvement. Two thirds of the planets species that inhabit land live in forests.  This article is provided by the Nature Conservancy, an organization built to preserve forests. This site contains information on the conservation of forests, and how they reestablish, and protect them. It is obvious that the site is updated continuously because it contains features and new articles throughout. This organization also provides information on their purpose, where they can be contacted, and what the reader can do to help. This source keeps information relevant and up to date to keep the reader involved. \\nAn additional site, American Forests, is another conservation organization. They go into more detail of the importance of forests to air, water, climate, energy, wildlife, recreation, and people. For example, “The average healthy, mature tree produces roughly 260 pounds of oxygen annually. The average person consumes 386 pounds of oxygen per year. Two trees provide enough oxygen for one person per year” (American Forests) .  When you realize what two trees are capable of, you can only imagine what acres and acres can provide. Another source I found was an article that was displayed on an environmental interest website, or similar to a blog. The author of this site stated, “…3 million hectares (7.5 million acres) of forest loss per year…” (Messanger, Stephen) . A statistic like that does not imply the author’s opinion of the decrease in forests, but it gives the reader a sense of what is occurring today. This particular article was written in 2010, which could have been subjected to change over the past two years, but it also referrers to the number of forests being destroyed from 10 years prior and compares them.  \\n\\nI suggest that the information I have researched should be added the definition of Forest to Wikipedia. The statistics referred to in the above paragraphs had been referred from reputable organizations. They provide useful information on the importance of forest and their existing well being. Adding these facts to the definition will keep the reader interested because the author is stating the truth as opposed to making a observation or assumption. \\nIf acceptable, I would like to abide by Wikipedia rules, and help improve the existing definition to help readers better understand that forests are more than just a cluster of trees and what they contain before the article goes into the detail and the geography behind them.  I can be reached at my Wikipedia ID at laj-NJITWILL or by email at laj2@njit.edu.

== Ongoing Challenges ==\\nUtopia presents a fascinating instance of the set of problems, challenges and achievements that are entailed in the long search for a just integration of remote indigenous people into the Australian community. Its 30 year history is a record of 'self-determination' on a background of well developed communal will, strong participation, and an experience during the era of settlement which included some profitable relations with white pastoralists and some degree of continuous occupation. It's success, in mitigating the clinical disorders associated with transition to sedentary life, and minimising the advent of destructive behaviours and intoxicants; in maintaining a strong commitment to traditional practices and customs, and the ever present interest in the issue of identity in the face of coercive change, are impressive. Even so, the future of Utopia and places like it is problematic; the notion of integration itself the subject of contention; self determination is only effective inside a sphere of dependency that brings with it a plethora of social and political consequences. To many observers, the outstanding deficiency in remote communities is education, which provides its beneficiaries with capacities for choosing the terms of their own integration. It is of course, also a powerful integrative force itself, and so shifts the issue of cultural identity. The tensions due to these inevitable dilemmas are present at Utopia. The community is however in an unusually good position to resolve them, given time and a sympathetic administration.
\\n'''Miss Africa New Jersey'''beauty pageant was established in 2011 to focus on the intelligence, culture, talents, and beauty of African women in New Jersey. This contest was carefully thought out, planned, and designed to help uplift and reward outstanding young African women. We believe this event can be used to help promote the empowerment of women and girls in various countries throughout Africa. In addition, it is our hope that we will be able to provide a great foundation for African women who are making changes in Africa through education; and also for those educating young African women to become strong and efficient role models as well. Sadly today, more and more young African women are making the wrong choices. Dropping out of school, getting involved with drugs, alcohol, crimes and experiencing motherhood at early ages are all problems facing today’s youth. Because women are the backbone of every nation, we believe this event has great potential to make major changes. They is a wise saying that “When you educate a woman, you educate a nation.
Unknown to many people, bananas have historical societal significance. Bananas have been known to help reduce the symptoms and pains of PMS in females. They are ripe when they are spotted brown- not when they are green or nearly fully brown. Their consumption can assist concentration and focus by healing some stress and keeping eyesight healthy. Banana peels can heal warts when the inner part of the peel is placed on the skin. They are a rich source of fiber and many other essential nutrients and vitamins. Presently there are various examples in the public realm that highlight the importance of bananas. Here are just a few of those examples: the children's show "Bananas in Pajamas," the banana slug as the mascot for the University of California at Santa Cruz, an online networking portal named "Broadband Bananas," and the Washington Banana Museum.

This is an updated and edited version of Robin Marris' classicThe Economic Theory of Managerial Capitalism (1964). This was widely recognized as pathbreaking as it was the first attempt by a professional economist to make a formal theory of the behavior and growth of a large-scale "managerial" corporation based on a realistic assessment of the sociological and institutional environment. The model determined the long run growth rates of individual firms on the basis of the financial and market environment on the one hand, and the needs, interest and aspirations of both managers and shareholders on the other. Managers in particular were shown to trade desire for growth against fear of takeover. These then novel important features of modern capitalism--mergers, takeovers and executive bonuses and the relationship between the growth of firms and the growth of the economy--have become increasingly topical. The new book contains the original introduction along with reworked and updated coverage of the theoretical model, along with completely new chapters both of micro-theory and assessing and responding to the debate which the book created.
Eliahi Priest,\\n\\nSeeks simple advanced and clean energy solutions for obvious reasons we are all aware of.\\n\\n\\nAfter only 2 or 3 generations of cultural madness, we now ALL bear a responsibility to at least 4,000 generations into the future.\\n \\n \\nSince the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the world has fallen into a madness of nuclear proliferation. While the nuclear power industry will proclaim its validity as a clean energy producer, it is clear that its only real intent is the plutonium extracted from spent uranium fuels that service the military agenda of nuclear warfare. Nuclear power as an energy source is an absurdity that only underlines the madness and irresponsibility of those who assume leadership in service of an oligarchic global hedgemony.\\n\\nNuclear power is profoundly harmful to all life. Not only that, but it is absurdly inneficient in its processes. After the mining, processing, and shipping of uranium, and the plant construction, maintenance, and deconstruction, a nuclear plant only produces about as much energy as went into it — not counting the need to store the only thing it actually produces (radioactive waste) for hundreds of thousands of years — and not counting the sacrifice of areas of the earth. Uranium has a half life of 4.5 billion years and as exposed radioactive waste causes lung cancer, bone cancer, and kidney failure. Radioactive waste is deadly for more than 240,000 years (9,600 generations), while deep underground storage facilities such as Onkalo in Norway, shudder at a 100,000 (4,000 generations) year forecast.\\n\\nUranium mining poisons miners and families by contaminating surrounding lands, scarce water supplies and the air they breathe. Most Uranium is mined from lands that indiginous cultures recognise as sacred with awareness of the uranium that is present. Kazakhstan is the worlds largest uranium miner, followed by Canada and Australia. In Kazakhstan soil erosion and water shortage are serious issues. In Canada and Australia (and the US)  dispute with first nation peoples has been intense over both uranium mining and nuclear waste repository sites.\\n\\nAn average nuclear plant produces 20-30 tons of high-level waste and 70 tons of low-level waste per year.  There already exists a very approximate level of 300,000 tons of high level nuclear waste that must be dealt with (250,000 tons in 2010 according to the documentary 'Into Eternity'). The amount of high level nuclear waste continues to increase as long as nuclear power generation is contiued. No proven long-term storage site exists.  If one ever does, we won’t know what language to post the warning signs in, as no human language has lasted a fraction of the time the nuclear waste will remain deadly. Confronted by this truth proposed 'Adaptive Phase Management' of nuclear waste means burying it and forgetting about it. Out of site out of mind is not a responsible attitude for dealing with extremely toxic nuclear waste.\\n\\nThe madness of the nuclear age must end NOW, and anyone who assumes any position of authority must address responsibility for the harm already created and recognise the new energy potentials that can deliver unlimited, non-harmful, non-polluting free energy, establishing an age of prosperity and abundance for all. Such solution is wholly aligned with the will of Gt. Spirit.\\n\\nSimples.
3 Predictions for Older Adults in 2009 from the Nutrition Experts\\n\\nHow Fitness and Nutrition Professionals should be aware of these predictions and educate the older population about Resistance Training and Nutrition in Brain Health\\n\\nHere's what some of the Nutrition experts predicted and reported at the American Dietetic Association's Food and Nutrition Conference & Expo in Chicago late October 2008:\\n\\nConference presenters predicted that Baby Boomers will fall victim to debilitating condition called sarcopenia , a progressive loss of muscle mass. To respond  to this "silent epidemic," fitness professionals should educate older adults about the benefits of exercise , especially resistance training .\\nNurture your noggin was the call of some presenters who spoke about the vital role of nutrition in brain health. Presenters discussed the beneficial effects of different nutrients and food compounds , such as omega -3 fatty acids found in fish , and theanine , an amino acid  found in tea . The take-home message was that nutrition may improve memory and slow cognitive decline associated with aging.\\nA new term, ecogastronomy, refers to the trend among consumers to eat "green" and in a way that sustains both our planet and our bodies. Presenters underscored the need to educate people about how their food  choices affect the environment; examples of negative influences included our reliance on disposable plastic bottles and throwaway utensils, Americans' excessive beef consumption and the transport of goods over great distances\\n\\nThese are the facts and predictions of the very best and we should all make an effort to educate the public and the consumers of these influences and trends.

Reducing body fat has become a common challenge in our 21st century world.  Our days are filled with busy schedules and time restraints.  Hence we take quick and easy meals to satisfy our body metabolism.\\nThese meals may not be what our bodies need.  Our bodies are not able to work at the highest level of functioning; mentally, physically and spiritually.  We require answers to our questions; how we get beyond this challenge and how can we enable a recovery process if our bodies have been neglected in proper nutrition.  What complicates this challenge is the fact that every human being is different and requires different nutrients.\\n\\nThrough searching out and finding our body types we are able to assist in discovering the best nutrition and thus achieve the highest level of body functioning.
Beijing's Pollution Alarms Neighbors \\n\\nThe good news for the Chinese leadership is that their fiscal policies have paid off, producing both the world's second largest economy and the globe's leading creditor nation in less than a generation. \\n\\nThe less good news is that the country's hell-bent drive towards industrialization has brought in its train a host of collateral problems, not the least of which is pollution. Last month Beijing's air pollution soared past levels considered hazardous by the World Health Organization. \\n\\nPrior to that, the government often played down the pollution in Beijing, insisting it was merely fog, despite evidence to the contrary that was plain for all to see. Earlier this year, following public pressure resulting from hourly air-quality readings first published in 2011 by the U.S. embassy in Beijing, which Chinese authorities had previously denounced as "foreign interference," the municipal officials took notice. On 12 January the air-quality monitor operated by the U.S. embassy in Beijing recorded a Particulate Matter PM 2.5 level of 886 micrograms a cubic meter, nearly 35 times what the World Health Organization considers safe. \\n\\nHow bad? \\n\\nOn 5 February flights were grounded as visibility fell to around 200 meters across Beijing. Last month Beijing's Jiangong Hospital recorded a 30 percent spike in cases involving respiratory problems and the hospital's Emergency Department chief Cui Qifeng noted, "People tend to catch colds or suffer from lung infections during the days with heavily polluted air." \\n\\nAccording to a Chinese Academy of Engineering specialist in respiratory diseases, speaking about Beijing's current pollution levels, "It (the pollution) is more frightening than SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). For SARS, you can consider quarantine and other means. But no one can escape from the air pollution and indoor pollution." The six-month SARS epidemic in 2003 killed 775 people in 25 countries. \\n\\nCauses? \\n\\nBeijing alone now has five million cars choking the streets, spewing their exhaust into the air. More importantly, the nation's pollution problems are caused by China developing at a speed and scale unprecedented in history, which has produced widespread environmental degradation that the central authorities have been slow to acknowledge. Aside from vehicle exhaust, thermal energy plants utilizing the nation's poor grade coal power the country's factories, providing the heat for hundreds of millions of homes even as they belch toxins into the atmosphere. \\n\\nAnd the toxic air threatens to become an international issue as well. Drifting across the Sea of Japan, the smog is now impacting parts of Japan, with the Japanese Ministry of the Environment's website on 5 February being overloaded. One ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity said, "Access to our air-pollution monitoring system has been almost impossible since last week, and the telephone here has been constantly ringing because worried people keep asking us about the impact on health." \\n\\nWhile the Japanese government remained discreet about air quality issues, Ministry of the Environment official Yasushi Nakajima was more blunt, stating, "We can't deny there is an impact from pollution in China." According to National Institute for Environmental Studies researcher Atsushi Shimizu, the prevailing winds from the west carry air pollution over western Japan. The pollution from China has exceeded government limits for particulate matter, which government concern focusing on particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter, whose concentration has been reported as high as 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air in northern Kyushu. The Japanese government limit is 35 micrograms. \\n\\nSolutions? \\n\\nResponding to the recent crisis, Beijing's city government ordered 103 heavily polluting factories to suspend production and told government departments and state-owned enterprises to reduce their use of cars by a third. \\n\\nMore immediately, on 6 Feb. the Chinese government issued a timetable for its program to upgrade fuel quality, aiming to implement a strict standard nationwide by 2017, upgrading its standard V for automobile petrol, with sulfur content within 10 parts per million before the end of the year. \\n\\nBut the country's long term solutions will not be inexpensive  reducing the use of coal, forcing cars to use efficient pollution exhaust equipment, and developing mass transit options to reduce the country's rising love affair with the automobile. \\n\\nChina now has the wealth to implement such solutions whether the political will is there is quite another matter. Should authorities not act, then they'd better ramp up the country's health insurance policies, as undoubtedly more and more workers will be reporting sick days. \\n\\nSource: http://www.indepthexploration.com\\n\\nSource: http://oilprice.com/The-Environment/Global-Warming/Chinas-Smog-Becoming-an-International-Issue.html \\n\\nBy.

In 2006, [http://savethechildren.net/alliance/index.html Save the Children]  launched its Rewrite the Future program to ensure that the millions of children unable to attend school because of war or conflict get access to quality education. '''Over 77 million''' children are growing up today without an education. '''32 million''' children are out of school in areas affected by war and conflict. '''Millions more''' living in conflict-affected countries are receiving a substandard education.\\n\\nYet education can bring protection and stability, and the potential to start building a more peaceful and prosperous society. \\n\\nIn areas of war and conflict, education is often among the first casualties. Schools close, teachers flee or are recruited into the military, and school systems are no longer funded. This puts children at risk, making them easier targets for recruitment as child soldiers, or exploitation as cheap labor. It also increases their vulnerability to trafficking and abuse.  \\n\\nSave the Children pledges to:\\n\\n* Ensure quality education for 8 million children: access to education for 3 million children and improved quality of education for these children and 5 million more. \\n* Work to make schools safe environments for protecting children affected by conflict. \\n* Influence national governments and international agencies to prioritize education at the onset of an emergency. \\n* Increase public and private funding for quality education for conflict- affected countries.\\n\\n==See also==\\n\\n* [[Save the Children]]
{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n'''Introduction to Mining''''''Bold text'''\\nEvery living organism on earth survives by consuming resources found in its immediate environment; it is either prey or predator. From cradle to grave man is dependent on resources from the environment for shelter and sustenance. For sustenance, nutrition and nourishment these resources can be obtained from two sources, harvesting living organisms for food, either through a hunter-gathering nomadic existence or a settled pastoral crop-growing usually coupled with animal husbandry life-style. For shelter and hand implements, man turns to the minerals, metals, soils and gravels that are encountered on earth. Mining is the study of obtaining inorganic minerals, metals, and carbonic fuels from the solid portion of the surface crust of the earth in an organised manner and on an industrial scale to satisfy the need of man to survive on the hostile environment of the planet.

Drunk driving is the act of operating and/or driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs to the degree that mental and motor skills are impaired. It is illegal in all jurisdictions within the U.S. The specific criminal offense is usually called driving under the influence [of alcohol and/or other drugs] (DUI), and in some states driving while intoxicated (DWI), operating while impaired (OWI), or operating a vehicle under the influence (OVI). Such laws may also apply to boating or piloting aircraft.\\n\\nIn the United States the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that 17,941 people died in 2006 in "alcohol-related" collisions, representing 41 percent of total traffic deaths in the US. Over 500,000 people were injured in alcohol-related accidents in the US in 2003. NHTSA defines fatal collisions as "alcohol-related" if they believe the driver, a passenger, or a nonoccupant of the vehicle (such as a pedestrian or pedalcyclist) had a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.01 or greater. NHTSA defines nonfatal collisions as "alcohol-related" if the accident report indicates evidence of alcohol present. NHTSA specifically notes that "alcohol-related" does not necessarily mean a driver or nonoccupant was tested for alcohol and that the term does not indicate a collision or fatality was caused by the presence of alcohol.[1] On average, about 60 percent of the BAC values are missing or unknown. To analyze what they believe is the complete data, statisticians simulate BAC information.\\n[http://www.legalx.net California DUI]
'''Taiko Fujimura''' is a mixed media artist based in San Francisco. Working with wood, paints, plexiglas, mirrors and found objects, she creates conceptual two- and three-dimensional collage and assemblage works as well as paintings on wood, canvas, rice paper, and several types of archival papers. Her three-dimensional work is designed to invite the viewer to interact with each piece to discover his or her personal aesthetic within the microcosm of what Taiko presents as the broader representation of beauty.\\n\\nTaiko selects materials that link her inner self with the outside world, creating an extended montage of her personal experiences, connections and relationships with both people and objects. Her pieces confront the dichotomies between chaos and order, industrial and organic, mind and body, positive and negative, logical and random, and intuitive and sequential. She feels an understanding of dualism is key to her art. Her pieces seek to bridge the contradictions around us by unifying space.\\n\\nThe concepts she explores include quietude, peacefulness, harmony, unity, and universality. Her work is strongly influenced by Japanese wabi-sabi, an aesthetic system she strongly believes to be "beautiful" art and Japanese calligraphy, which she studied since age six. Her works appear in over 100 private and public collections globally.
ECuebas Sandbox\\n\\nFundraising and advocacyJDRF's largest fundraising event in the U.S. is the Walk to Cure Diabetes. Events are held across the country to raise awareness about type 1 diabetes and raise funds to be put toward research.[7]\\n\\nJDRF's Children Congress is its premier advocacy event and is held every two years in Washington, D.C. Children ranging from age 4 to 17 are selected from each state to become their state's delegate in Washington. Delegates then head to Washington to meet with their representatives to tell their stories and advocate for increased federal funding and support for type 1 diabetes research.[8]\\n\\n[edit] ResearchJDRF funds research that is aimed at improving the lives of people with type 1 diabetes today and in the future. JDRF focuses on research that seeks to: stop or slow the disease’s progression in people who are newly diagnosed; reverse the disease and its complications in those who have lived with it for years; prevent type 1 in people at risk and in future generations; and improve treatments for type 1 diabetes and provide better tools to achieve tight blood glucose control for people at all stages of the disease.\\n\\nJDRF research can be categorized in three main areas:[9]\\n\\nCure, which includes:\\nReplacement and Regeneration Research (replacing or regenerating the beta cells that produce insulin)\\nImmune Research (reversing and preventing the immune system attack that causes type 1 diabetes)\\n\\nTreat, which includes:\\n\\nArtificial Pancreas Project Research (closing the loop between continuous glucose sensing technologies and insulin pump technologies)\\n\\n\\nGlucose Control Therapy Research (improving people’s lives by enabling them to maintain better control of their blood sugar by development of either new devices or therapies)\\n\\n\\nComplications Prevention Research (stopping or reversing the progression of complications in people with diabetes, such as eye or kidney disease—and treating these conditions in the people who already have them)\\n\\n\\nDiabetic Eye Disease Research\\n\\n\\nPrevent, which includes:\\n\\nPrevention Research into the environmental and genetic causes of the disease. JDRF has both pre-autoimmunity and post-autoimmunity strategies aimed at minimizing and/or eliminating common triggers of the disease.\\n\\nCurrently, JDRF is funding more than 53 human clinical trials, several of which are in the advanced stages of clinical testing needed before Food and Drug Administration approvals are required.
\\n\\nA supernova is the explosion of a star when it has ultimately reached the end stages of its life. After a supernova explosion, the star's gaseous remains are fired into space at insanely high speeds. But these gases do not just simply fade away into nothingness. Instead, these gases form the most fascinating and unique object ever found, a nebula.\\n\\n'What is a nebula?', you may ask. Well, a nebula is a cloud of dust and gas in outer space. I find nebulas very beautiful, they hold whole star systems with planets, maybe even capable of wielding life on their surface.
What is spatial opacity?\\n\\nSpatial opacity is a geographical term who leads with any type of obstacles who are found in space. Spatial opacity is everywhere an can have multiple characteristics, whether it is natural (hills, mountains, lakes, seas and so on) or not natural (traffic lights, intersections, doors and so on). Spatial opacity is everything that stops or interrupts any type of flows who are related to space.\\n\\n\\nMASDA \\n\\nCourses:\\n\\nThe main input from the courses is a very theoretical overview of the material. Depending on the subject, you may get some applied examples on how the theory matches real examples. \\nThe courses include a lot of training in statistics as well as approaches to spatial planning with computer support (GIS). All courses are presented with Powerpoint support and in the English language. \\nMany courses treat various policy issues on spatial planning of the European Union as well as political issues within the different EU Member States. In addition to that, there are some courses about sustainability in terms of spatial planning. \\nMost of the courses are related to the European Union and do not necessarily treat spatial planning of non-EU member States.
'''Virtual Surgery'''\\n\\nVirtual reality is a computer generated technology which allows information to be displayed in a simulated environment. Over the past decade virtual reality and computer simulation have expanded into other domains including the medical field.\\nVirtual reality is perhaps being used more in Medicine than in any other industry, because its applications have such far-reaching benefits. It promises to bring one of the most dramatic changes to the practice of medicine over the next decade.\\nIn Surgical training there is often a short fall in the number of desired operations performed. One consequence is that trainees may have less practice and feel less confident about many surgical procedures and techniques. With the increasing level of difficulty of surgical procedures it has become imperative that trainees have an arena in which to learn their trade that is forgiving. With the advent of Virtual reality, this has become a reality. \\nAt the present there are many applications of virtual reality in Medicine\\n•	Education - VR is used to create an environment for learning anatomy where exercises can be easily reversed.\\n•	Simulation for Surgical training -VR can teach surgeons new procedures and determine their level of competence before they operate on patients. It allows the trainee to practise a skill several times as a refresher course. \\n•	Project Hippocrates: VR is used to simulate, plan and execute Orthopaedic surgeries. The goal of this system is to allow the surgeons to simulate operations and then alter their approach to them based on the results of the simulated surgical procedure. The program allows the surgeon to plan his or her surgery.\\n•	Telemedicine: Telemedicine is a system of electronically communicating data from one site to a distant site for the purpose of medical diagnosis, patient care and as a medium for delivering medical services over long distances.
Individual differences psychology focuses on this second level of study. It is also sometimes called Differential Psychology because researchers in this area study the ways in which individual people differ in their behavior. This is distinguished from other aspects of psychology in that although psychology is ostensibly a study of individuals, modern psychologists often study groups or biological underpinnings of cognition.\\n\\nFor example, in evaluating the effectiveness of a new therapy, the mean performance of the therapy in one group might be compared to the mean effectiveness of a placebo (or a well-known therapy) in a second, control group. In this context, differences between individuals in their reaction to the experimental and control manipulations are actually treated as errors rather than as interesting phenomena to study.\\n\\nThis is because psychological research depends upon statistical controls that are only defined upon groups of people. Individual difference psychologists usually express their interest in individuals while studying groups by seeking dimensions shared by all individuals but upon which individuals differ.
Beware of food-borne diseases this summer\\nBy EDUARDO GONZALES, MD\\nMarch 30, 2009, 12:16pm\\nQ. Is it true that food-borne diseases are more common during summer? If so, why? Can you enumerate these diseases? How can we prevent them? -- Myrna M., Los Banos, Laguna \\n\\nA. Yes, the incidence of food-borne diseases peaks during summer. This is primarily because most food-borne pathogens (i.e., disease-causing microorganisms) grow fastest in warm and humid weather. Furthermore, people do more cooking and eating outdoors (i.e., picnics, barbecues, campings) during summer, which means they do without the safety facilities that their houses provide such as refrigeration and proper washing. \\n\\nThe list of diseases caused by pathogens or their toxins (poisons) that are transmitted through the intake of contaminated food and water is a long one. Most of these diseases affect the gastro-intestinal tract, but some affect other organs, too.  Food-borne pathogens include viruses such as the hepatitis A virus; bacteria such as those that cause food poisoning and various forms of gastroenteritis, cholera, typhoid fever and botulism; protozoa such as E. histolytica, the causative agent of amebiasis; and, other parasites such as ascaris, other roundworms and tapeworms.\\n\\nAny food item can be contaminated by pathogens and toxins. The contamination can occur during production, processing, distribution, preparation or storage of food. \\n\\nContamination of food with disease-causing agents can occur in the farm. For example, tapeworms which humans acquire when they eat raw or half-cooked meat find their way into pork or beef when cattle and pigs ingest the eggs of these worms while grazing. Another example, amoeba and the hepatitis A virus contaminate vegetables if plants are fertilized with night soil or watered with water from sewage canals (two common practices in the Philippines). \\n\\nFood processing plants that do not comply with standard health safety procedures are also occasional sources of pathogens in food products. But very often, food-borne illnesses are caused by improper handling and preparation of food at home.  \\n\\nFood-borne diseases, without exception, are preventable. Most can be prevented by simply observing the following measures:\\n\\n* Buy and consume only food (either raw or processed) that complies with safety standards.\\n* Cook food thoroughly. In particular, meat should not be eaten raw.\\n* Thoroughly wash with flowing water fruits and vegetables that are to be eaten raw.  This will not totally eliminate pathogens, but their number can be significantly reduced for the body’s other defenses to take care of.\\n* Wash food items for cooking before chopping or cutting.\\n* Wash with soap and water all utensils, chopping boards and kitchen areas before preparing meals.\\n* Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing, eating and handling food.\\n* Eat cooked food within 1-2 hours after cooking. \\n* Refrigerate leftovers within 1-2 hours. \\n* Re-heat leftovers thoroughly before eating.\\n* Do not allow contact or mixing of raw and cooked foods.  \\n* Protect food from rodents, cockroaches, flies and other insects.\\n* Consume milk only if it has been pasteurized.\\n* Ensure that your drinking water is safe.\\n* When going for outings, keep perishable food like cooked meats, potato salads, etc. in an insulated cooler that is packed with ice. Do the same for raw meat, poultry and vegetables, but in a separate cooler.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that may develop two to three weeks after a Group A streptococcal infection (such as strep throat or scarlet fever). It is believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity and can involve the heart, joints, skin, and brain[1]. Acute rheumatic fever commonly appears in children between ages 5 and 15, with only 20% of first time attacks occurring in adults[1].\\n\\nIt gets its name for its similarity in presentation to rheumatism.[2]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Diagnosis\\n \\nRheumatic heart disease at autopsy with characteristic findings (thickened mitral valve, thickened chordae tendineae, hypertrophied left ventricular myocardium).Modified Jones criteria were first published in 1944 by T. Duckett Jones, MD.[3] They have been periodically revised by the American Heart Association in collaboration with other groups.[4] According to revised Jones criteria, the diagnosis of rheumatic fever can be made when two of the major criteria, or one major criterion plus two minor criteria, are present along with evidence of streptococcal infection. Exceptions are chorea and indolent carditis, each of which by itself can indicate rheumatic fever. [5][6][7]\\n\\n[edit] Major criteria\\nMigratory polyarthritis: a temporary migrating inflammation of the large joints, usually starting in the legs and migrating upwards. \\nCarditis: inflammation of the heart muscle which can manifest as congestive heart failure with shortness of breath, pericarditis with a rub, or a new heart murmur. \\nSubcutaneous nodules: painless, firm collections of collagen fibers over bones or tendons. They commonly appear on the back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees. \\nErythema marginatum: a long lasting rash that begins on the trunk or arms as macules and spreads outward to form a snake like ring while clearing in the middle. This rash never starts on the face and it is made worse with heat. \\nSydenham's chorea (St. Vitus' dance): a characteristic series of rapid movements without purpose of the face and arms. This can occur very late in the disease. \\n[edit] Minor criteria\\nFever \\nArthralgia: Joint pain without swelling \\nRaised Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C reactive protein \\nLeukocytosis \\nECG showing features of heart block, such as a prolonged PR interval[8] \\nSupporting evidence of Streptococcal infection: elevated or rising Antistreptolysin O titre or DNAase.[1]. \\nPrevious episode of rheumatic fever or inactive heart disease \\n[edit] Other signs and symptoms\\nAbdominal pain \\nNose bleeds \\n[edit] Pathophysiology\\nRheumatic fever is a systemic disease affecting the peri-arteriolar connective tissue and can occur after an untreated Group A Beta hemolytic streptococcal pharyngeal infection. It is believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity. This cross-reactivity is a Type II hypersensitivity reaction and is termed molecular mimicry. Usually, self reactive B cells remain anergic in the periphery without T cell co-stimulation. During a Strep. infection, mature antigen presenting cells such as B cells present the bacterial antigen to CD4-T cells which differentiate into helper T2 cells. Helper T2 cells subsequently activate the B cells to become plasma cells and induce the production of antibodies against the cell wall of Streptococcus. However the antibodies may also react against the myocardium and joints[9], producing the symptoms of rheumatic fever.\\n\\nGroup A streptococcus pyogenes has a cell wall composed of branched polymers which sometimes contain "M proteins" that are highly antigenic. The antibodies which the immune system generates against the "M proteins" may cross react with cardiac myofiber protein myosin[10],heart muscle glycogen and smooth muscle cells of arteries, inducing cytokine release and tissue destruction. However, the only proven cross reaction is with perivascular connective tissue.[citation needed] This inflammation occurs through direct attachment of complement and Fc receptor-mediated recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. Characteristic Aschoff bodies, composed of swollen eosinophilic collagen surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages can be seen on light microscopy. The larger macrophages may become Aschoff giant cells. Acute rheumatic valvular lesions may also involve a cell-mediated immunity reaction as these lesions predominantly contain T-helper cells and macrophages.[11]\\n\\nIn acute RF, these lesions can be found in any layer of the heart and is hence called pancarditis. The inflammation may cause a serofibrinous pericardial exudates described as “bread-and-butter” pericarditis, which usually resolves without sequelae. Involvement of the endocardium typically results in fibrinoid necrosis and verrucae formation along the lines of closure of the left-sided heart valves. Warty projections arise from the deposition, while subendothelial lesions may induce irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques.\\n\\nChronic rheumatic heart disease is characterized by repeated inflammation with fibrinous resolution. The cardinal anatomic changes of the valve include leaflet thickening, commissural fusion and shortening and thickening of the tendinous cords. [11]\\n\\n[edit] Treatment\\nThe management of acute rheumatic fever is geared toward the reduction of inflammation with anti-inflammatory medications such as aspirin or corticosteroids. Individuals with positive cultures for strep throat should also be treated with antibiotics. Aspirin is the drug of choice and should be given at high doses of 100 mg/kg/day. One should watch for side effects like gastritis, salicylate poisoning etc. Steroids are reserved for cases where there is evidence of involvement of heart. The use of steroids may prevent further scarring of tissue and may prevent development of sequelae such as Mitral stenosis. Monthly injections of Longacting Penicillin must be given for a period of 5 years in patients having one attack of Rheumatic fever. If there is evidence of carditis, the length of Penidure therapy may be up to 40 years. Another important cornerstone in treating rheumatic fever includes the continual use of low dose antibiotics (such as penicillin, sulfadiazine, or erythromycin) to prevent recurrence.\\n\\n[edit] Infection\\nPatients with positive cultures for Streptococcus pyogenes should be treated with penicillin as long as allergy is not present. This treatment will not alter the course of the acute disease.\\n\\n[edit] Inflammation\\nPatients with significant symptoms may require corticosteroids. Salicylates are useful for pain.\\n\\n[edit] Heart failure\\nSome patients develop significant carditis which manifests as congestive heart failure. This requires the usual treatment for heart failure: diuretics and digoxin. Unlike normal heart failure, rheumatic heart failure responds well to corticosteroids.\\n\\n[edit] Prevention\\nPrevention of recurrence is achieved by eradicating the acute infection and prophylaxis with antibiotics. The American Heart Association recommends daily or monthly prophylaxis continue long-term, perhaps for life.[12]\\n\\nScreening school-aged children for sore throats also aid in prevention.\\n\\n[edit] Epidemiology\\n \\nDisability-adjusted life year for rheumatic heart disease per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.[13] \\n     no data\\n \\n     less than 20\\n \\n     20-40\\n \\n     40-60\\n \\n     60-80\\n \\n     80-100\\n \\n     100-120\\n \\n     120-140\\n \\n     140-160\\n \\n     160-180\\n \\n     180-200\\n \\n     200-330\\n \\n     more than 330Rheumatic fever is common worldwide and responsible for many cases of damaged heart valves. In Western countries, it became fairly rare since the 1960s, probably due to widespread use of antibiotics to treat streptococcus infections. While it is far less common in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century, there have been a few outbreaks since the 1980s. Although the disease seldom occurs, it is serious and has a mortality of 2–5%.[14]\\n\\nRheumatic fever primarily affects children between ages 5 and 15 years and occurs approximately 20 days after strep throat or scarlet fever. In up to a third of cases, the underlying strep infection may not have caused any symptoms.\\n\\nThe rate of development of rheumatic fever in individuals with untreated strep infection is estimated to be 3%. The incidence of recurrence with a subsequent untreated infection is substantially greater (about 50%).[15] The rate of development is far lower in individuals who have received antibiotic treatment. Persons who have suffered a case of rheumatic fever have a tendency to develop flare-ups with repeated strep infections.\\n\\nThe recurrence of rheumatic fever is relatively common in the absence of maintenance of low dose antibiotics, especially during the first three to five years after the first episode. Heart complications may be long-term and severe, particularly if valves are involved.\\n\\nSurvivors of Rheumatic fever often have to take penicillin to prevent streptococcal infection which could possibly lead to another case of Rheumatic fever that could prove fatal.
'''The Problem of Global Warming'''\\n\\nWe face many environmental challenges that pose a risk to the well-being of life on earth. Many scientists would agree that at the forefront of these issues stands global warming. Global warming poses a multitude of problems that threaten us. Not only are the issues of global warming risks to our health, they are also potential dangers to the entire planet and every living creature that dwells on it. If we truly want to resolve global warming, we must establish a comprehensive strategy that addresses a way of preserving the world for the future.\\n\\n'''The effects of Global Warming and how Mankind Contributes to Our Problem'''\\n\\nBecause of our careless and reckless disregard for the Earth, some nasty effects of global warming are all too common. These include things like: diseases spreading, the potentially destructive melting of the polar ice caps which could result in the disastrous flooding of the Earth, and the diminishing of the protective layers of the atmosphere. It may also be connected with causing allergies to become more severe. According to an article in the August 17, 2000 edition of the New York Times, pollen levels may rise as carbon dioxide levels are increasing. This happens because the more carbon dioxide there is in the air, plant growth is accelerated. \\n\\n'''What We Can Do to Make a Positive Change'''\\n\\nAs an environmentalist who enjoys experiencing nature and capturing its beauty in photography, I am alarmed by the fact that the United States is contributing the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The appropriate plan to act on global warming is to treat Mother Earth with more consideration by driving less, controlling the population from reaching a level the world does not have the resources or space to sustain, and recycling and planting trees. If we were to collectively do this, we would do much to help with global warming. \\n\\n'''An Explanation of How These Environmentalist Ideas Would Help'''\\n\\nActing on these ideas I have presented would help in different but significant ways. If we were to walk to the store, instead of driving, we would be releasing less carbon fumes into the air, which would result in preserving the diminishing layers of the atmosphere. If we were to control the population from becoming even more crowded than it already is, we would not need to burn down our forests and destroy nature to make room for the incoming population. Recycling and planting trees promotes a healthy environment by allowing us to save valuable and fleeting resources, and by planting trees, we are letting plants release more oxygen into the atmosphere which makes a difference with global warming by balancing the levels of oxygen and carbon.\\n\\n'''Final Note'''\\n\\nIt is time to finally treat Mother Earth with the respect she deserves and truly needs for us to continue living on this planet. We’ve also victimized plants and animals by ruthlessly destroying their habitat, and by threatening species of animals and plants into extinction. Animals and plants have just as much right as humans to live hospitably in an environment where they can thrive, without humans ruining their terrain. My hope is to motivate even a few readers of the **** ****** to preserve the earth, and to speak out against people polluting Mother Earth. The sooner we realize this, the better off humanity will be.
The Mold problem and the human bio-toxin pathway\\n\\n\\nMolds are everywhere! \\nThey are the largest biomass on the planet and are constantly at work breaking down biodegradeables every minute of everyday. They are in the air we breath, indoors and outdoors, and are usually not causing problems with humans. \\n\\nThat is, until they invade our homes or place of business! \\nRemember,moisture follows gravity and molds follow moisture...EVERY TIME! When a moisture problem occurrs, such as a roofing leak, flood, or even when the air system is shut-off in a humid environment, molds will begin to grow and colonize almost anywhere on almost any organic material. They can even grow on plastic and metal and other materials normally concidered safe from fungal invasion when dirt or other organic build-up exists.\\n\\nWhen molds invade our indoor environments, the amount of airborne mold spores is amplified to a much more dangerous level than we are normally exposed to, which can cause severe health effects and reactions in humans. \\nThe majority of these health effects are caused by the toxins that molds create to protect their spores or "babies". These toxins are chemical compounds that are attached to the spores to protect them from their natural predators, like germs, insects and bacteria. \\n\\nWhen most of us breathe in airborne mold spores, our bodies can recognize the intruders and can normally produce anti-bodies to destroy them and remove them from the body. \\nBut nearly 25% of humans have been found to have an irregular HLA-DR gene, and this is the gene that controls the immune response system in the body. Normally one or two people will suffer far more health problems than the rest of the inhabitants, who normally feel that the others are "over-reacting or paranoid". Far from paranoid, these people recognize the effects the molds are having on their bodies, and the effects are often more serious than most people realize. \\n\\nBio-toxins can cause a mirriad of health effects in humans, ranging from headaches and allergy symptoms to asthma, resperatory infections and other serious long-term health issues. Some people will eventually develope "multiple-chemical-sensitivity", a term that many physicians are still unfamiliar with and have no knowledge of treatments.

They lack close friends due to the isolation they have adapted to. Some examples of what socially isolating yourself can mean are staying home, having no communication with anyone including friend and family, and basically avoiding any contact with other beings. If there is any social contact with another social species then it is most likely concise. Emotional or psychological challenges are the results of social isolation.  These results can cause symptoms of feeling depressed, distress, or anxious. This causes feelings of loneliness, fear of others, or negative self-esteem. \\n\\n\\nSocial isolation is common among early adulthood. Some cases of this isolation can get extreme. Clear boundaries are more characterized when the ego part of the personality is fully developing. This personality component that Sigmund Freud proposed is defined as a idea of a person's self physically and mentally. Independence gives a sense of disconnection from others. During this time of development, a person may become more preoccupied with feelings and thoughts of their individuality that are not easy to share with other individuals. This can be a result from feelings of shame, guilt, or alienation during childhood experiences.

With the gradual worsening of climate change, Asthma is a serious chronic illness that is currently on the rise.  Approximately 20 million Americans are inflicted with asthma.  According to the Environmental Defense Fund, more than “4,000 die every year from the disease, which also causes some 1.8 million emergency room visits” (EmergencyDefenseFundOnline).  Why, in recent years, has asthma symptoms become more prevalent?  Who is most vulnerable to its effects?  How does global climate change come into play?  \\n	Beginning with defining asthma and what it does to the body, the reader can better understand asthma as a chronic illness that “constricts airways and makes them swollen, filling with mucus. Your chest feels tight -- you may cough or wheeze -- and you just can't seem to catch your breath. In severe cases, asthma attacks can be deadly” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Furthermore, the Natural Resources Defense Council found that asthma kills approximately “5,000 people every year in America” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  It has been proven that people residing in poorer areas, with little sanitation, and both young children, and the elderly, are vulnerable subgroups to climate change and its effects on asthma.  \\n	Beginning with the world’s poorest populations, the Practical Action organization found that the world’s poorest people are the hardest hit by climate change due to devastating droughts, floods, and other weather events (PracticalActionOnline).  Furthermore, Practical Action proclaims that there is a massive injustice present since “climate change is caused by the world’s richest countries” (PracticalActionOnline).  Since poor countries lack the financial means and strong voice to rise up against rich countries’ plans, which may have a debilitating effect on the earth’s environment, and further leads to climate change and the influx of asthmatic symptoms, these poor nations bear the burden of climate change.  \\n	According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the persistence of certain diseases, such as asthma, depend largely on climate change (EPAOnline).  The extreme temperature changes that we have experienced cause a great loss of life, particularly on the elderly.  Additionally, the extreme high temperature changes can “increase air and water pollution, which in turn harm human health” (EPAOnline).  Furthermore, the EPA explains that “climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can indirectly impact the incidence of serious infectious diseases” (EPAOnline).  \\nIt is important to note that the “extent and nature of climate change impacts on human health vary by region, by relative vulnerability of population groups, by the extent and duration of exposure to climate change itself and by society’s ability to adapt to or cope with the change” (EPAOnline).  By being exposed to these extreme climate changes, people are more inclined to contract diseases, such as asthma.  Climate change is expected to contribute to some air quality problems.  \\n	 Respiratory disorders, such as asthma, are more prevalent as the climate changes in extreme manners.  The four main air pollutants that trigger asthma are as follows: Ground Level Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide, Particulate Matter, and Nitrogen Oxide.  Beginning with Ground Level Ozone, it is a “toxic component of smog…that is produced at ground level when tailpipe pollution from cars and trucks reacts with oxygen and sunlight” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Ground level ozone is most common in city-like environments.  People living in cities, which are known to be less sanitary than suburban areas, are predominantly poor and thus lack the means to move to areas with better air quality.  The cities are filled with buses and cars emitting harmful gases into the air and thus harming people in the near surroundings. \\n	Sulfur Dioxide is a “respiratory irritant…that is produced when coal and crude oil are burned” ( NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  As mentioned previously, cities are filled with objects emitting harmful gases into the air, and sulfur dioxide is quite prevalent in city-like living areas.  Sulfur Dioxide is emitted from coal-fired power plants.  Unfortunately, “one in five Americans lives within 10 miles of a coal-fired power plant” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  The fact that so many Americans live in such a close proximity of the coal-fired power plants goes to show that poor people do not have a great advantage at living in sufficient living conditions.\\n	Particulate matters are tiny particles in the air.  They come from a wide range of pollutants, such as dust, soot, and diesel exhaust particles (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  If these small particles are suspended from the air and into the lungs, then an asthma symptom can be triggered; thus affecting the asthmatic.  Approximately, “81 million people live in areas that fail to meet national air quality standards for particulate matter” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Coal-fired power plants and diesel vehicles are major emitters of particulate matter and thus further prove that people residing in poor living conditions are affected more than people living in more affluent areas.\\n	Finally, Nitrogen Oxide is a “gas emitted from tailpipes and power plants…it contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone and smog” (NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncilOnline).  Furthermore, Nitrogen Oxide, when mixed with other air pollutants, form small particles that can trigger asthma.

These impacts arise not only from raw materials and component purchases, supplier manufacturing processes or logistics aarangements, but can also include final product disposal and even the siting of supplier plants. Given the strategic importance and the scale of organisational buying, a range of possibilities for environmental initiatives exist in the supply chain. These begin with the product, component or raw material to be purchased, where the buying company could stipulate minimum standards that the purchased product has to fulfil.\\nFor example, a paper-maker can insist the woodpulb in buys conforms to recognised standards of forest management rather than being made from clear-cutting an entire forest, or an electronic company can require its supplier to avoid certain harmful heavy metals in the supplied products. Other product based environmental initiatives can aim at by products of supplied input such as recycling packaging or reducing waste.
Why Donate Blood ?\\n\\nBlood is the living fluid that all life is based on.\\nBlood is composed of 60% liquid part and 40% solid part. The liquid part called Plasma, made up of 90% water and 10% nutrients, hormones, etc. is easily replenished by food, medicines, etc.\\nBut the solid part that contains RBC (red blood cells), WBC (white blood cells) and Platelets take valuable time to be replaced if lost.\\nThis is where you come in. The time taken by a patient's body to replace it could cost his/her life. Sometimes the body might not be in a condition to replace it at all.\\nAs you know blood cannot be harvested it can only be donated. This means only you can save a life that needs blood.\\nEvery year India requires 40 million units of 250cc blood out of which only a meager 500,000 of blood units are available. Saving a life does not require heroic deeds.\\nYou could just do it with a small thought and an even smaller effort by saying "yes".
 History is the study of the past, with special attention to the written record of the activities of human beings over time. Scholars who write about history are called historians. It is a field of research which uses a narrative to examine and analyse the sequence of events, and it often attempts to investigate objectively the patterns of cause and effect that determine events.[1][2] Historians debate the nature of history and the lessons history teaches.[1][3][4] A famous quote by George Santayana has it that "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."[5] The stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the legends surrounding King Arthur) are usually classified as cultural heritage rather than the "disinterested investigation" needed by the discipline of histna

== Environment ==\\n\\n''ENVIRONMENT''\\nThe Environment The impact of people on their environment can be devastating. This is where the respective role of governments can make decisions that shape environmental policy and responsibilities. These governments can be broken up into four different levels: local, state, federal and international. Air quality and biodiversity are two current issues that can be related to the role of governments. Global warming is also another implication that has a devastating effect on the environment. Current examples include the rise in sea levels, polar meltdowns, the melting of ice sheets and glaciers and human deaths due to disease from the effects of global warming. Firstly the environment can be defined as the natural features of our surroundings such as plant and animal life and their habitats, water, soils and the atmosphere. A local government named Rockdale Municipal Council has implemented certain actions to deal with the quality in that region. They have recognized that the main source of poor air quality originates from air pollution sources such as motor vehicles, industrial premises and aircraft emissions. The solutions to these problems include improvements to Ryde and Botany Bay cycle way, integration of land use and transport planning strategies, production of Air Quality - the Facts booklet for community, investigation of complaints regarding odours and dust, tree planting and preparation of a Local Air Quality Management Plan in 1999. Air quality is a major issue in most states within Australia that affects our greenhouse, to tackle the implications state governments have created policies and responsibilities. For instance Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) is a program that enables mainly state governments to take action on greenhouse. CCP provides these state governments with a strategic framework to diminish greenhouse gas emissions by helping them identify and recognize the emissions of their council and community, set a reduction goal and develop and utilize an action plan to reach that goal. State actions include: capturing the methane from landfill sites and public and non-car transport into urban planning. On a federal or national basis Australia has employed policies to increase the air quality. For example the Commonwealth Government will guarantee that Australia carries its fair-share of the burden in worldwide efforts to combat global air pollution through policy development and implementation. They have also supported the National Greenhouse Strategy (NGS) which began in late 1996. The government will also support the development of a national strategy to observe and manage air toxics. The air toxics strategy will monitor, establish the levels of community exposure to, and manage emissions of selected air toxics. The federal government will even consider the inclusion of air toxics in a future National Environmental Protection Measure. Further measures include the leading of the development of national ambient air quality standards through the National Environmental Protection Council and the assistance of the establishment of a National Pollutant Inventory which will require large companies to publicly report their emission of 90 pollutants. Local government Rockdale Municipal Council has introduced responsibilities and policies to reduce the loss of biodiversity. This local government has learned that the cause involves the introduction of species, pollution of land and water, weed invasion and urban encroachment. Their solutions to these problems comprise of the planting of over 3,500 plants and shrubs in Bardwell Valley and Scotts Reserve, bush regeneration and planting in Scarborough Reserve, involvement in Cooks River Foreshores Working Party and preparation of a flora and fauna study in 2000. Policies towards the community include controlling noxious weeds on your property, planting native trees indigenous to the area and applying to the council prior to removing any trees. The Labor Tasmanian Government has created a new Environment Policy on biodiversity that hopes to preserve native plants and animals. The policies commit the government to encourage community involvement in biological diversity programs, proclaim the Tasman National Park, establish a State Biodiversity Committee with community representation to arrange a Tasmanian Biodiversity Strategy, support the development of a State Policy on the protection of remnant native vegetation, examine the possibility of incorporating the Biodiversity Strategy into legislation and seeking the co-operation of local government and the community in including and enforcing biological diversity guidelines in development criteria. The federal government has enabled several policies to deal with conservation of Australia's biodiversity. The government will support the National Reserve System program to expand Australia's National Parks, support off-reserve biodiversity conservation including the planting of trees and the protection of vegetation through the Bushcare program and work with the States to reduce unsustainable land clearing, develop an alert list of introduced plants and animals that pose a risk to our environment. The government will also maintain a ban on the export of live fauna; support research into Australia's floral and fauna assemblages as well as biodiversity conservation methods and ratify the Desertification Convention. An international conference held in Kyoto, Japan in December 1997 discussed issues on how best to reduce global warming. Kyoto Protocol negotiations have reached a legally binding agreement limiting the amount of gas emissions all industrialized countries. The protocol also included provisions for emission trading between industrialized countries. The overall nominal effect of the Kyoto protocol is for a reduction of 5.2% of emissions by 2010. However the agreement has many flaws and could lead to emission rising above 1990 levels. The protocol specifies that Japan must reduce emissions by 6%, USA by 7% and the European Union by 8%. The chairman of the conference negotiators, Raul Estrada said that further discussions were needed to find a way of implementing a system of trading in emissions. Trading allows countries that produce high levels of greenhouse gases, such as the USA,to buy the right to retain or even increase emissions. 15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)15:34, 1 August 2009 (UTC)~~\\nGlobal warming refers to an expected rise in global average temperature due to the continued emission of greenhouse gases produced by industry and agriculture which trap heat in the atmosphere. Higher temperatures are expected to be accompanied by changing patterns of precipitation frequency and intensity, changes in soil moisture and a rise of the global sea level. To assess current examples relating to global warming, an examination is first needed on these examples. Sea levels could rise six feet and up in future centuries. The entire Amazon rainforest will be lost if the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases by more than 50%. But no matter whatever action the world takes to stop global warming, sea levels are set to rise and wipe out several island nations. The worst news is that whatever governments do to cut emissions, sea levels will rise by at least 2 metres over the next few hundred years, devastating Tuvalu and Kiribati in the Pacific and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean. Low-lying farmland and cities occupied by hundreds of millions of people will also be engulfed. Robert Nicholls of Middlesex University in London stated that thermal expansion of the ocean will continue for many hundreds of years after CO2 is stabilized, due to the gradual penetration of heat deeper and deeper into the ocean. All around the world ice sheets and glaciers are melting at a rate quite remarkably since record keeping began. A worldwide institute, based in Washington DC says that glaciers and other features are particularly sensitive to temperature shifts, and that scientists suspect the enhanced melting is among the first observable signs of human induced global warming. Some of the effects of global warming are as follows: arctic ocean sea ice shrunk by 6% since 1978, with a 14% loss of thicker year round ice, Greenland ice sheet has thinned by more than a metre a year on its southern and eastern edges since 1993 and 22% of glacial ice volume on the Tien Shan mountains has disappeared in the last 40 years. Worldwatch declared that the Earth's ice cover reflects much of the sun's heat back into space and the loss of much of it would affect the global, raise sea levels, and threaten water supplies. They also stated that the land and water left revealed by the retaining ice would themselves retain heat, creating a feedback loop that would speed up the warming process. The institute pronounced that the world's glaciers, taken as a whole, are now shrinking faster than they are growing. Worldwatch also warns of the outcomes of retaining ice on wildlife. In northern Canada reports of hunger and weight loss among polar bears have been associated with ice cover changes. And in Antarctica, sea loss, rising air temperatures and increased condensation are altering the habitats and the feeding and breeding patterns of seals and penguins. Cornell University ecologists believe that global warming may account for millions of human deaths from disease. David Pimentel a professor of ecology at Cornell stated and assumes that Most of the increase in disease is due to numerous environmental factors, including infectious microbes, pollution by chemicals and biological wastes and shortages of food and nutrients. Global warming will only make matters worse. Global warming will produce a favorable climate for disease producing organisms and plant pests. Global climate change will result in a net loss of obtainable food, for example the decline in rainfall (due to global warming) causes crop and plant production to die out. Infectious disease and environmental factors are to blame for more than 75% of all deaths in the world. Environmental disease may comprise of organic and chemical pollutants, including smoke from tabacco and wood sources. More than three billion people are malnourished. Malnutrition increases vulnerability to pollution-related illnesses and diseases such as diarrhea. Therefore Pimental concluded, we're seeing the first signs that global climate change can influence the incidences of human disease. And that this change combined with population growth and environmental degradation, will probably intensify world malnutrition and increases in other diseases as well. Melting is taking on vast and unprecedented level in the Arctic sea ice, the Antarctic and in dozens of mountain and sub-polar glaciers, and the rate has accelerated immensely in the past decade. The Earth's ice cover could have intense changes on the global climate and rising sea levels could start regional flooding. Melting of mountain glaciers could also endanger urban water supplies and the habitats of plant and animal species in fragile environments. Within the next 35 years, the Himalayan glacial area is expected to shrink by one-fifth, to just 100, 000 kilometres. A prediction forecasts that the remaining glaciers could disappear in 30 years. The melting has been especially noticeable in the past three decades, and scientists believe that it is the result of human behaviour and the build up of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. All current examples of global warming are significant due to the effects that it has on the environment and people. For people, it can cause infectious diseases and pollution-related illnesses that in turn effect our standard of living. Some examples can be more significant than others. For example diseases amongst people is more so important than the rise in sea levels and melting of glaciers since peoples existence are endangered\\n\\n		\\n		\\n		\\nIn Your Home – Conserve Energy \\n1.

Its effects and causes have been on the rise and people need to do something about it before the problem gets any worse. Global warming is an increase in the earth's temperature, which can be caused by the use of fossil fuels, and industrial or agricultural processes. Man-made emissions are adding to the amount of carbon dioxide already being naturally released. These harmful processes have been leading to a large increase in the buildup of "greenhouse gases," which are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor.

This is mostly due to [Network congestion] in which the concerned party experiences a delay in delivering or accessing content.  Internet bottlenecks and [Network congestion] are similar at the network infrastructure level, but much different in terms of policy effects.  The implications of controlled bottlenecks on user and content producer experiences online can have positive and negative effects, of which are not addressed in [Network neutrality], which argues for the fair and accessible use of the Internet by all concerned parties.  have largely been discussed in terms of [Network congestion], which discusses more mathetical and high level inerpretations of what bottlenecks are and how to solve them from a network engineering perspective.
Silver was probably one of the first metals smelted from ore. Silver goes back to the times of the ancient Byzantine, Phoenician and Egyptian empires. Other than jewelry, silver has been forged into domestic utensils, buttons, boxes and other articles. Other than liquid mercury, silver is the brightest reflector among metals. This allows it to be polished to sheen. The Latin word for silver is Ag - Argentum that stands for 'white and shining'.\\n\\nAncient silver jewelry was handed down the generations among North and South American natives. Silver is extensively mined in the ores of Mexico and Peru. The comparatively low price of silver makes it a popular metal for jewelry, especially for fine and innovative designs. Silver jewelry craftsmen experiment with silver and later duplicate their patterns with gold.\\n\\nSilver jewelry is popular with women who want to achieve a less-formal look. Silver jewelry is popularly gifted to women and children. Even men can be gifted silver cuff links, tiepins or signet rings. It is representative of a tender emotion or a lovely memory. Sterling silver jewelry carries a stamp of sophistication without being over the top. Find out how to care for your silver jewelry.
Lesotho is one of the poorest countries in the world and is classified as a Least Developed Country. The apparel industry is the largest employer in Lesotho. It has been built on the preferential trade opportunities created by the US Growth & Opportunity Act (AGOA) and is working on moving up the value chain to create a niche market as an ethical sourcing destination.\\n    The Apparel Lesotho Alliance to Fight AIDS (ALAFA) is an industry-wide programme providing prevention and treatment for the 46000 mainly women workers in the industry. This is helping to combat two of the key drivers of the HIV/AIDS edpidemic: poverty and gender inequality. Surveys within the industry show that 43% of employees are HIV-postive.\\n    The creation of ALAFA was driven by humanitarian concerns and the need to make the industry sustainable in the long term. It was launched in May 2006 in Maseru.\\n    ALAFA is a direct beneficiary of the ONE T-shirt campaign by the Campaign to Make Poverty History and receives a donation from every T-shirt sold.
== Herpes ==\\nHerpes is a viral infection disease causing small painful blisters and inflammation, most commonly at the junction of skin and mucous membrane in the mouth or nose or in the genitals areas. It is more common in women than in men possibly because male to female transmission is more efficient than female to male transmission. Oral herpes causes cold sores around the mouth or face. Genital herpes affects the genitals, buttocks or anal area. The virus can spread even when sores are not present. Mothers can also infect their babies during childbirth. Some people have no symptoms. Others get sores near the area where the virus has entered the body. They turn into blisters, become itchy and painful, and then heal. The virus can be dangerous in newborn babies or in people with weak immune systems. \\n           Most people have outbreaks several times a year. Over time, you get them less often. Medicines to help your body fight the virus can help lessen symptoms and decrease outbreaks. Correct usage of latex condoms can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading herpes. Most people get Herpes Simplex Virus type - 1 infections, which cause cold sores, during infancy or childhood. They usually get it from close contact with family members or friends who carry the virus. It can be transmitted by kissing, sharing eating utensils, or by sharing towels. The sores most commonly affect the lips, mouth, nose, chin, or cheeks and occur shortly after exposure. Patients may barely notice any symptoms or find these sores annoying and seek medical attention. Most people get Herpes Simplex Virus type - 2 infections, which cause genital sores, following sexual contact with an infected person. The virus affects anywhere between five and twenty million people, up to 20% of all sexually active adults in the United States.\\nThe lesions of both types of herpes simplex can be spread by touching an unaffected part of the body immediately after touching a herpes lesion.

\\nLove is an emotion of a strong affection and personal attachment.[1] Love is also a virtue representing all of human kindness, compassion, and affection; and "the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another".[2] Love may also be described as actions towards others or oneself based on compassion, or as actions towards others based on affection.[3] In English, love refers to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from pleasure ("I loved that meal") to interpersonal attraction ("I love my partner"). "Love" may refer specifically to the passionate desire and intimacy of romantic love, to the sexual love of eros, to the emotional closeness of familial love, to the platonic love that defines friendship,[4] or to the profound oneness or devotion of religious love.[5] This diversity of uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states. Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts.[6] Love may be understood as part of the survival instinct, a function to keep human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.
'''Introduction:'''\\n\\nFlood is a common phenomenon in Bangladesh. Flood related crises have a gender dimension and affect women, the silent gender, more than men, who have the least capacity to deal with the situation for a variety of cultural, economical, historical, political and social reasons. Floods hit women harder, not just because they are physically weaker, but because of their reproductive capacity, physical responsibility for children and vulnerable socio-economic status. The patriarchal social structure and norms, gendered economics and gendered culture of Bangladesh, underpinned by religious traditions restrict the mobility of women during floods. Wider household responsibilities of women like food processing and cooking, cleaning, collecting water and fuel, bearing and rearing children looking after livestock and income generation also become much more difficult to perform under flood conditions. This article is attempted to highlight how women become more vulnerable by their social status, both during and after the full impact of floods and also the strategies adopted by flood victim women, which are crucial for the household survival.\\n\\n\\n'''Flood and its causes:'''\\n\\nThe origins of floods in Bangladesh are diverse. Floodwater may come from three main sources:\\n\\n	Rivers\\n	Rainfall\\n	Sea\\n\\nThree together or independently, may all generate more water that can’t be drained quickly from the land. However, the specific causes of floods vary from region to region. Several explanations have been addressed here:\\n\\n	Confluence of the major rivers\\n	High monsoon rainfall\\n	Rise of sea level\\n	Siltation of rivers\\n	Flood control measures\\n	Deforestation\\n	Construction of Farakka barrage and others\\n\\nThe last three causes, flood control measures, deforestation and the construction of Farakka barrage, are not only due to natural environmental factors but also to social factors.\\n\\n'''Flood control measures and women:'''\\n\\nIn Bangladesh embankments have been used as a traditional flood control measure since long time. However, a number of studies and reports have pointed out the negative consequences of Flood Control and Drainage (FCD) and Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation (FCDI) projects: the benefits of these projects were not planned. Because such projects are often not based on the nature of the flood plain, they do not prevent flood but rather increase flood losses. Many embankments have had a negative effect on river regimes, land formation, agriculture and fisheries and on the overall environment. Researchers have pointed out that any step to control flooding should emphasize both the structural and non-structural methods. They have discussed the problems of floods and the negative consequences upon the environment, farmers (men), and fisheries and on many other aspects of life in Bangladesh. However, they have ignored the problems of women. There has been almost no discussion of the differential impact of flooding upon men and women and very little about its impact upon people in different socio-economic categories. Policy makers, however, have only recently started to think about the way in which women might be involved in different activities from men and have different experiences of flooding from men, They have agreed that women’s activities should be ‘visible’ in the development sector and therefore, should be integrated with development activities in the water sector (The Fourth Five Year Plan, 1995). There are only a few studies (e. g. Adnan, 1990; Hanchett, 1992) which briefly consider the situation of women during floods. FAP 14’s gender study was based on a few case studies of female-headed households and was not compared with men’s response.\\n\\n'''Problems faced by women during floods:'''\\n\\nDuring floods women face different types of problems. For example:\\n\\n	Women suffer from lack of food, clothing and shelter during floods. Owing to their lack of resources, poor women face greater problems than women in middle and rich households. They suffer from shortages of food and other essentials, resulting in increasing prices and a consequent decline in purchasing power. They often have to eat unusual food and adjust consumption patterns of this.\\n\\n	Unemployed men often sit idle or move elsewhere leaving their household members behind during floods. It is women, the household-based workers, who have to take responsibility for protecting their houses, children and other members of the family, livestock and belongings.\\n\\n	Traditional gender specific work, such as carrying water, cooking, caring for children and animals become too difficult for women during flood conditions. Especially gender-assigned tasks like procuring food and providing drinking water, storing fuel and child care are such that women have to bear more physical burden of coping than men do. \\n\\n	Women’s assets such milch cows, poultry, trees, kitchen and utensils are particularly vulnerable to flood.\\n\\n	Domestic violence also increases during floods. Husbands beat their wives and children when food-supply run out in flood-stricken households.\\n\\n	Many women often become unwilling to go to flood shelters because of the Muslim culture ‘purdah’ which means that women should not show themselves to unrelated men.\\n\\n	During floods poor widow women confine to their houses for many days and have to drink flood water as they have neither the physical strength to reach tube wells, nor the economic means to hire a boat to collect clean water.\\n\\n	Bangladeshi women wear long 'Shari', which hinders their movement from one place to another during floods. It often entangles in fixed debris and limits the speed of evacuation. Again, poor women with only one Shari are often oblige to remain in wet cloth for most of the days for the lack of private space and to dry off.\\n\\n	Victim women often don’t have cloths to come out to take relief. Again, many women lose their breast-feeding infants in flood and suffer from puffed breast pain. There also happen cases of miscarriage which don’t get proper medication during floods. Pregnant and lactating women suffer from malnutrition i.e. lack of vitamin A, iodine and iron deficiencies, which result in eye diseases, night blindness, anemia, goiter etc.\\n\\n	In flood shelters women face several problems, which are related to their gender identity. For example, it becomes impossible for women to disregard their inhibition and go to latrines, which are open to all. They often have to wait till dark/night to ensure privacy to response the calls by nature, even changing the clothes/sanitary pad with menstrual blood.\\n\\n	While distributing relief in shelters, women are often pushed down and left behind in the rush by men. Again, child care, illness and conservatism keep many women away from taking relief goods. Women also give part of their food ration to their children consequently denying themselves the opportunity to maintain their strength and support their families.\\n\\n	Women who are in their own for whatever reason, whether they are single, widowed, abandoned, unaccompanied, lone heads of households or who have been separated from male family members by the chaos of the flood situations, often become victim of sexual violence in flood shelters.\\n\\n	Women are further vulnerable to the secondary impacts of floods due to socio-cultural and economic factors. When resources such as temporary shelter, fresh water, food and medicines are distributed, women are again marginalized. For example, in many cases women are unable to make decisions about whether loans should be secured to rebuild homes or to purchase crop seeds or other means to generate an income such as the purchase of a boat for transporting goods.        \\n\\n'''Coping mechanisms of women during floods:'''\\n\\nFloods affect both women and men but the burden of coping with flood falls heavily on women. The tasks women perform before, during and after floods, the problems they face and the coping mechanisms they adopt are related to women’s gender identity. Women in poorer categories often act as men do in making platforms, cutting bamboo, making bamboo bridges protecting crops and livestock and engaging in income generating activities. On the other hand, men usually remain more restricted to their gender-assigned activities. Some of the coping mechanisms of women have been highlighted here.\\n'''\\nWomen and water collection:'''\\n\\nThe collection of water during floods causes great problems for women. Women are usually responsible for collecting and storing water. During floods tube-wells, the most common source of pure drinking water in Bangladesh, go under water and poor women have to take considerable risks to procure drinking water from great distances. They have to walk through chest-high water or swim to collect fresh or clean water. Again, they have not enough fuel to boil water or fitciri to purify it with alum. However, they help each other to get pure drinking water from different sources.\\n\\n'''Sale of women’s assets:'''\\n\\nThe sale of assets is a common way for rural households to survive any crisis. Non-productive assets like milking cows or goats, jewellery or household items cannot usually produce a continuous income as land or cattle but they can easily be converted to cash and are therefore the first to be disposed off to meet the immediate needs of family survival. These assets usually belong to women, and they are often their only assets. They are sold, or mortgaged by their husbands to repay loans, to educate sons or to maintain the livelihood of the households. Both women and men resist changing their status from farmer to landless as long as they have other options to cope with crisis. Most women don’t have own valuable assets as men do. Even if they have some assets they are considered ‘less valuable’ or ‘non-productive’. However, women’s ‘non-productive’ assets become more ‘productive’ when they are disposed off during floods. Women’s assets are used to meet the immediate needs of the households during floods when men’s assets are kept for the future. \\n\\n'''Women and food preparation:'''\\n\\nDuring floods there is a great difference in the kind of food, the amount and the frequency of food preparation and the sources of food among women in different socio-economic categories. The food supplies of the poor, undernourished and malnourished at the best of times, are further reduced during the floods and it is women who have the responsibility for adjusting the household food consumption. Women’s work is closely related with agricultural production, family food and income generation and that is why the burden of food shortage falls upon them.\\n\\nMost of the poor households don’t have a reliable and stable source of food during floods. Women in these categories play a vital role in acquiring food from many sources, some of which are totally different from flood-free sources. When there is a shortage they try to manage food through their own efforts by gathering edible or wild plants and small amounts of low quality food such as rotten or discarded vegetables or accepting rice gruel from better-off women. Destitute and landless women maintain their livelihood by a hand-to-mouth existence. During floods the normal pattern of food consumption in the household changes. The price of staple food items becomes so high that it goes beyond the purchasing power of the poor. So, they often cook khesari or kalai dal (kind of inferior pulse), mania or cheer paddy, which they consider to be animal food, curry with fen (rice gruel) and chhatu (flour normally made of barley or chickpea or maize), kura (the red powdery coating of rice under the husk), lumps of flour burnt in the fire, one handful of rice with lots of water and chili, fried broken bits of grain and different aquatic plants. It is also evident that both women and men in poorer categories suffer from food shortages and women commonly sacrifice their own meals for their husbands and children.\\n\\n''' \\nWomen and common village resources:'''\\nDuring floods women become undernourished subsisting on a lean diet of vegetables, creepers and herbs. Their dependence on food from the common land increases greatly. When men fail to earn any money, they become helpless and do not feel it incumbent upon them to find alternative source of food for their families. Women, on the other hand, are much more capable than men of collecting food for families. They usually collect variety of food items from village common land like Shapla (the stem of the water lily) which women use as a major food item and is often mixed with others like kolmi shak (arum leaves) or kochumukhi (wild arum). \\n\\n'''Women and family health care:'''\\n\\nThere are some general flood-diseases, such as, diarrhea, viral fever, jaundice, skin diseases, conjunctivitis and swelling of limbs. It is evident that without any healthcare facilities from government or other organizations during floods, it is women who provide health care for the sick. Only women have knowledge about certain medicinal trees and they use herbs, roots and barks to cure family members from different types of diseases. Poorer women take risks to collect medicinal herbs from distant places during the floods despite purda restrictions. Men, on the other hand, rarely do such work because providing herbal treatment or nursing is not their gender-assigned role. Men in poorer categories also do not have the resources to get modern treatment. However, most women in the poorer categories, despite their own sickness and other activities, try their best to cure sick family members themselves in order to avoid the cost of modern treatment.\\n\\n'''Women and social network:'''\\n\\nWith little or no support from the government during floods, the women of poor households sick help from their social networks. Such support mainly comes from their own and that of their husbands’ kin and sometimes from patrons and neighbors. Women are able to get more support from such relationships than men. Relatives and neighbors provide shelter, lend food, supply loans with little or no interest, provide temporary employment and help with money, labor or materials to rebuild houses after floods. Men, on the other hand, do not show such ability to provide for their households. Borrowing small things or food is not a man’s responsibility and asking for help is often considered below their dignity.\\n\\n'''Recommendations:'''\\n\\nDuring floods where people as a whole are vulnerable, women are more vulnerable as they bear the burden of managing the survival of the household. Therefore, special attention should be given on after-flood rehabilitation program for women. For example:\\n\\n	There should be more female volunteers. In the case of major floods, male volunteers can not adequately meet women’s needs. \\n\\n	Women relief workers face higher security risks and obstructive ness from local male leaders and government officials when trying to carry out their work. More women volunteers should be available to form a strong group, able to overcome these problems collectively.\\n\\n	Female doctors and nurses should be included in the volunteer team, alongside a male medical team. Emergency medicine and equipment should be available to cope with women’s needs. For example, many women lost their breast-feeding infants during floods. Pumps to express breast milk must be available, in order to avoid serious infection and debilitating pain. Equipment and medication is needed to handle the inevitable miscarriages. \\n\\n	Poor women generally know fewer languages. So, local volunteers are needed to overcome language problems, in order to get access to the women more easily and to understand their specific needs.\\n\\n	During relief distribution women should be given first priority, and a separate distribution line needs to be organized for them as they have the additional responsibility for children.\\n\\n	In particularly conservative areas women may need house-to-house distribution as they face social obstacles to come to the distribution line to compete in the struggle for food supplies, elbowing and pushing, with men.\\n\\n\\n	As women must be fully clothed to go out to get food, clothing is an essential part of emergency relief.\\n     \\n'''Conclusion:'''\\n\\nThe inclusion of gender perspective in the study of flood is very pertinent and justified considering the context of Bangladesh. During floods where people as a whole are vulnerable, women become more vulnerable who bear the burden of managing the survival of household under crisis. Therefore, for effective flood management programs to be conceived and implemented successfully, gender specific awareness must be fully realized and accounted for. Since many women become disoriented and threatened by the loss of their homes, flood management policies need to be sensitive and aware of the meaning and significance of home and the implications for dealing with female flood victims. To reduce the vulnerability of women during floods specific programs should be devised and implemented that raise the awareness of women to the risks they face and also the range of adjustments that they can make. Such programs also need to be culturally and socially sensitive. Because of women’s significant contributions to their households’ survival during floods, their activities need to receive attention in government planning. \\n\\n \\n'''Bibliography:''' \\n\\nAhsan, Rosie Majid and Khatun.

Author: Eastine Charles Taneo\\n\\nDate published: March 10, 2012\\n\\n                       Deforestation has important implications for life on this planet. The transformation of forested lands by human actions represents one of the great forces in global environmental change and one of the great drivers of biodiversity loss. The impact of people has been and continues to be profound. Forests are cleared, degraded and fragmented by timber harvest, conversion to agriculture, road-building, fire, and in other ways. The effort to use and subdue the forest has been a constant theme in the transformation of the earth, in many societies, in many lands, and at most times. \\n\\n                       Forests are habitats and shelters to millions of species, reduce flooding, soil conserver, provide products for human use and consumption, give valuable ecosystem services.  They are home to more than half of all species living on land.  They also play several roles in the flooding because trees hold and use more water than farms or grasslands. With enough water, the river must rise above its banks and flood. The faster water runs from the watershed into the river, the higher a flood will be. Tree roots hold the soil in place, reducing the movement of sediment that can shrink river channels downstream and it can prevent soil erosion. Forests provide useful wood products.  Roundwood can be processed into building materials, or made into plywood products, furniture, etc. \\n\\n                       The following are factors of deforestation: logging, fires, urban construction, agriculture and commercial purposes.\\n\\n \\n\\n                     The first factor of deforestation is logging. Logging, both legal and illegal, is the cutting, skidding of trees in the forest. It is one of the major causes of deforestation in the world today. Trees that are cut-down are usually used by humans to trade. The logs are then generally transported to a saw mill to be cut into timber, a paper mill for paper pulp, of for other purposes like fence posts (Glastra, 1999). Logging is also tagged to the term “clearcutting”. It is a harvest method that removes essentially all the standing trees in a selected area (Glastra, 1999). A “clearcut” may or may not have reserve trees left to attain goals other than regeneration.\\n\\n                        There are different logging methods applied and some of these are “tree-length logging”, “full-tree logging”, and “cut-to-length logging”. Tree-length logging is a mechanized form of logging that involves felling and topping trees at the stump inside the cutblock or by the roadside (Wiki, 2009). The felled trees are then transported to the roadside or a landing site for hauling to a mill. Full-tree length is defined as trees are felled and transported to roadside with branches and top intact (Pulkki, no date). Transporting trees to the roadside is mainly by cable or grapple skidders. Cut-to-length method is trees are cut-off above the stump with stump height less than one-half butt diameter and bucked to various assortments directly in the stump area.\\n\\n                       The second factor of deforestation is fire. Forest fire is often used to signify an uncontrolled intense fire that breaks out in the wooded areas, grasslands, bushes, scrublands and peats due to many factors ranging from natural to man-made causes. It can easily spread to a vast area. It can also change its direction and overcome barriers like rivers and roads. Some of the causes of forest fires are natural such as lightning, and human activities and negligence like camp fire, lighted cigarettes (Bora, 2011) and kaingin system. Natural causes like lightning burns the trees and fire easily spread into the area.  About 14% of forest fires are due to lightning strikes (Dunn, 2009). Human activities and negligence are about 86% of forest fires (Dunn, 2009). Tourists or smokers sometimes leave camp fires or drop lighted items like cigarettes and matches in the forests which can easily set nearby bushes on fire and further develops into huge forest fire. On the other hand, kaingin or “slash-and-burn farming” system is an agricultural technique which involves intentional cutting and burning of trees in the forests to create fields. It includes a diverse collection of farming systems from long fallow shifting cultivation to short fallow shifting cultivation to forest pioneer farming. Unlike traditional farming methods that were used in harmony with the forests recuperative capacity, current slash-and-burn farming depletes the very soil resource upon which all agriculture and forestry depend. One of the strong commonalities of all slash-and-burn farmers is that they are among the poorest, most marginalized groups of their societies and have little or no influence on the important land use policy decisions made in their countries.\\n\\n                       The third cause of deforestation is urban construction. Forests are the way for residential houses, building and factories. Roads are building for trading and easier transports. This has made possible the needs of the social groups in the society. The cutting down of trees for lumber that is used for building materials, furniture, and paper products have a major impact on forest life. Forests are cleared to accommodate expanding urban areas.\\n\\n                       The fourth cause of deforestation is converting the forest to agricultural land. Trees in the forests are cut down to clear land for growing crops, build farms, ranches and other food growing lands. The economic consequences of deforestation and the process of becoming peasants are devastating. In contrast to the rich variety of foods the forest people are accustomed to plowing fields and peasants specialize in just four crops: rice, corn, tomatoes, and onions (Schelgel, 1999).  Hunting and fishing and gathering played almost no role at all in the cleared regions. The forests are gone and the rivers and creeks are seriously depleted. Commercial agriculture's role in deforestation is two-fold. First, agribusiness can indirectly result in deforestation. Commercial farms occupy the best and most fertile agricultural soils located in the valleys. This land is not available to the growing rural population that depends on agriculture for their subsistence. Without access to farmland in their immediate area, farming families have had to relocate to less fertile and less productive forested land. Second, agribusiness can be a direct cause of deforestation. Through a concession agreement, land purchase, or an informal land occupation; companies take possession of forested land with the intention of converting it to another use.\\n\\n                       The fifth cause is cattle ranching and livestock grazing. A cattle ranching is a major cause of deforestation. Ranchers occupy large tracts of forests and clear the land themselves or they buy the improvements made by small farmers. Traditionally, ranchers favored the more easily managed range and pasture lands of the dry forest zones, but for the last four decades there has been intensive clearing of the forests. Open-range grazing as is practiced in the dry woodlands can be a major contributor to deforestation when herd populations exceed the carrying capacity of the range. It can also seriously degrade the composition and quality of the forest when practiced too intensively.\\n                       The sixth cause of deforestation is mining and oil exploration that are locally important to deforestation. Large mines consumed vast quantities of indigenous woodlands to supply fuel to their smelting operations before plantations of fast-growing species were established (Lovekar, 2011). Oil exploration activities, such as the clearing of the seismic lines in the forests not only destroy the forests but also open them up to colonization by subsistence farmers who follow the exploration crews. The impact of gold mining has been widely publicized but its negative impacts have affected the indigenous peoples and the quality of the water more than the adjacent forests.\\n\\n                       The effects of deforestation may include loss of topsoil, disruption of the water cycle, loss of biodiversity, loss of potential discoveries, flooding and drought and climate change.\\n\\n                      First effect of deforestation is the loss of topsoil. Deforestation results in rapid degradation of nutrient rich topsoil. Heavy rainfall and high sunlight quickly damage the topsoil in clearings of forests. When these forests are cut-and-burnt, nutrients are released in the form of ash (Schlegel, 1999). This allows for a year or two of good crop on the newly cleared virgin land but eventually the nutrients will be washed away by the heavy tropical rain.\\n\\n                       Second effect of deforestation is the disruption of the water cycle. In the water cycle there are only a few processes that give water back to the atmosphere, such as transpiration, expiration and evaporation. Transpiration is the process by which water is loss from plants to the atmosphere (Starr, 2006). So, if plants are removed, especially at a high rate such as deforestation, there will be less water returning in the atmosphere. This will eventually cause a reduction in the amount of water returning the earth's surface such as the seas, lakes, rivers etc.\\n\\n                       Third effect is the loss of biodiversity. Biodiversity is the sum of all species occupying a specified area during a specified interval, past as well as present (Starr, 2006). Deforestation affects biological diversity by the destruction of natural habitats, which forces species out of their native areas. Isolation and fragmentation restrict their range, forcing them into unnatural and restrictive habitats, which may lead to their extinction. Temperature changes caused by loss of the protective canopy of the forest also contribute to this. Deforestation through clear-cutting creates a patched look to the landscape. Not only is this unpleasant to the eye, but it is terrible to the local wildlife. For other species, fragmented landscapes become population sinks that are sustained by immigration from nearby forest tracts (Schlegel, 1999). \\n\\n                       The fourth effect is the loss of potential discoveries. There is the possibility that the basic elements of potential medical treatments, cures and vaccines may lie undiscovered within these environments. The key active ingredient in one-fourth of the world’s prescription and non-prescription drugs come from plants growing in tropical rain forests. Fewer trees translate into an insecure future for forest workers. Some indigenous peoples’ way of life and survival are threatened by the loss of forests. Often, the stakeholders associated with forest areas are not always consulted before clearcutting occurs. This has sometimes lead to non-violent and violent confrontation and fueled bitter rivalries between area residents, the forest sector and environmentalists.\\n\\n                        The fifth effect is flooding and drought. One of the functions of forests is to absorb and store great amounts of water quickly when there are heavy rains. When the trees are cut down, it will not regulate or hold the flow of the water which leads to flooding and alters to drought. Deforestation causes a lack of soil cohesion and, because tree roots absorb water from the soil and allow it to absorb more water, it creates an ideal environment for flooding. A flat, treeless surface is perfect for flash floods. Flash flood has been the deadliest disaster that struck and killed hundreds of people in the cities of Cagyan de Oro and Iligan (Villanueva, 2011) last December  2011.\\n\\n                       The sixth effect of deforestation is global warming. Global warming is a phenomenon (greenhouse effect) whereby solar radiation that has reflected back off the surface of the earth remains trapped at atmospheric levels, due to the build-up of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, rather than being emitted back into space (Starr, 2006).\\n\\nThe major greenhouse gases and their sources/causes are:\\n\\nCarbon dioxide (CO2)\\n	-Fossil fuel, deforestation, animal respiration.\\n\\nMethane (CH4)\\n	-Cattle, rice paddies, gas leaks, termites, mining\\n\\nNitrous oxide (N2O)\\n	-Burning of fossil fuels, deforestation.\\n\\nChlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)\\n	-Air conditioning, solvents                             \\n\\nOzone (O3) and other trace gases\\n	-Car exhaust, power plants, photochemicals. \\n\\n\\n                       Global temperature is also rising. Different studies have shown the world’s average temperature has risen by 0.5o F-1.0o F on an average (Lovekar, 2011). The rise in the mean surface air temperature over the past hundred years supports this long term estimate. It is unknown whether the rise is part of Earth’s natural climate cycle or a result of the increase in greenhouse gases from human activity. A study in Canada, analyzing ground surface temperature, has found a one to two degree increase in ground surface temperature at the time of deforestation at each site (Swemson, 2011).\\n\\n                        The possible ways to protect and preserve the forests may include the following: reforestation, educating the farmers about deforestation, strict implementation of law about the problem, sustainable forest and water management.\\n\\n                       The first way is reforestation. It is causing a forest to occur again. This can be done by letting deforested land go fallow for several years or by replanting native species in open areas or adjacent to remaining forest. Here in Mindanao, some government and non-government organizations are doing tree planting projects. They plant trees to lessen the effect of climate change and recover what has been damaged by logging in the forest. The Philippine government supplies the seedlings but according to Pres. Benigno Aquino III there is an inadequate supply of seedlings that we could use in the country (Porcalla, 2011).\\n\\n                       The second way is educating the farmers.  There are peasant farmers who have left their traditional farm lands in search of new opportunities on the forest frontier. With a growing local population, restricted access to arable land, and few economic alternatives they have been forced to migrate to forested state lands to establish a new farm and homestead. They become prisoners of illiteracy and endemic poverty, and driven by the lack of access to arable lands and the lack of alternative employment opportunities, subsistence farming families must survive by clearing the forests to plant their crops. Though education, they can be responsible farmers. They must know the importance of our forests. The government may also give them alternative source of income like sustainable livelihood projects instead of clearing the forest to be converted in agricultural lands.\\n\\n                       The third way is the strict implementation of the laws concerning about deforestation. The authorities must strictly impose penalties to the one who breaks the law. Here in our country, Philippines, these are examples of the law of our government to fight deforestation: DENR Memorandum No. 52 and Executive Order No. 23.\\n\\n                      DENR(Department of Environment and Natural Resources) Memorandum No. 52 is limiting the processing of application permits of forest tenure holders within their plantation sites only (Villanueva, 2011). Environment and Natural Resources Ramon Paje announced last year, 2011, that chainsaws, bulldozers graders, and other logging tools and implements are now off-limits in natural and residual forests nationwide.\\n\\n                       Executive Order No. 23 is declaring a logging ban. President Benigno Aquino III issued the ban after visiting the provinces hit by floods and landslides in the country.\\n\\n                       The fourth way is sustainable forest and water management. According to Dr. Victor Rex Cruz, dean of the UP College of Forestry and Natural Resources, a sustainable forest management program to put in a place to assure sustainable harvest from natural forest, more investments in plantations and tree industries, and protection of watershed and protected areas while assuring the continuity of forest products and environmental services from all types of forests (Porcalla, 2011).\\n\\n                        Therefore, deforestation has a great impact in our society. It threatens not only biodiversity but it also endangers us humans which should protect the forest. It is true that it gives economic improvement to us but it also gives bad environmental effects. Controlling the problem is not a simple matter of enacting new laws and enforcing new regulations because laws and regulations already exist. What we need to do is to follow and obey this laws and regulations to lessen the bad effects of deforestation. We should be part of the solution and not adding to the problem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n•	Bora, C.

\\nJet streams are fast flowing, narrow air currents found in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth. The main jet streams are located near the tropopause, the transition between the troposphere (where temperature decreases with altitude) and the stratosphere (where temperature increases with altitude).[1] The major jet streams on Earth are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a meandering shape; jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including the opposite direction of most of the jet. The strongest jet streams are the Polar jets, at around 7–12 km (23,000–39,000 ft) above sea level, and the higher and somewhat weaker Subtropical jets at around 10–16 km (33,000–52,000 ft). The Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere each have both a polar jet and a subtropical jet. The northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia and their intervening oceans, while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica all year round.\\nJet streams are caused by a combination of a planet's rotation on its axis and atmospheric heating (by solar radiation and, on some planets other than Earth, internal heat). Jet streams form near boundaries of adjacent air masses with significant differences in temperature, such as the polar region and the warmer air towards the equator.[2]\\nMeteorologists use the location of some of the jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting. The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against the flow of a jet stream. Clear-air turbulence, a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety, often is found in a jet stream's vicinity. One future benefit of jet streams could be to power airborne wind turbines.\\nOther jet streams also exist. During the northern hemisphere summer, easterly jets can form in tropical regions, typically in a region where dry air encounters more humid air at high altitudes. Low-level jets also are typical of various regions such as the central United States. \\nA narrow current of strong wind circling the Earth from west to east at altitudes of about 11 to 13 km (7 to 8 mi) above sea level. There are usually four distinct jet streams, two each in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Jet stream wind speeds average 56 km (34 mi) per hour in the summer and 120 km (74 mi) in the winter. They are caused by significant differences in the temperatures of adjacent air masses. These differences occur where cold, polar air meets warmer, equatorial air, especially in the latitudes of the westerlies.

The MWRD expects this new energy source to supply the Kirie Water Reclamation Plant in Des Plaines, Illinois, with up to 40 percent of its heating and cooling energy needs. This plan could provide a model for heating and cooling energy needs at other MWRD facilities and for other facilities around the world. The sewerthermal system takes advantage of relatively constant high temperatures of effluent water and uses only 20 percent or less power than what is needed for a traditional, direct heating system. Rather than extracting heat from the ground as is common for geothermal systems, the MWRD’s system is designed to extract heat from the effluent water, which holds a steady minimum temperature of 55 degrees Fahrenheit.\\n[[Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago]]
The purpose of the article in progress, "Celtic Music and American Identity", is to understand how layers of American Identity have been construed based on an influx of Celtic music. The article intends to inform on the diaspora of Celtic music to America in the 19th and 20th centuries and its effect on cultural and ideological aspects such as musical fusion (Celtic Rock, Celtic Punk, Celtic Pop, etc.) and social elements (i.e. tattoo art, festivals, pubs) that are now distinctly American. \\n\\nThis article is written based on guidelines and for fulfillment of the course 'Music in International Relations' at Denison University, Spring 2012. The course focuses on various topics in International Studies in relation to music, such as peace concerts, concert aesthetics, and the relationship between musical and social harmonies. Studies in History and Religion has inspired the topic of this article, in addition to an immersion in Scottish and Celtic culture.
The French Revolution was a true revolution due to the fact that it follows many of the steps necessary to be called a revolution.  One step that should be mentioned is that the public was willing to use violence in order to protect the Third Estate.   This is significant due to the fact that the Third Estate is able to make the changes to the government that people want.  This is shown in the Storming of Bastille where revolutionists broke into the fortress in order to seize gunpowder and weapons.  In Addition, this act convinced King Louis XVI to withdraw his troops from Paris.   Withdrawing his troops showed that he was intimidated by the people, a major step in a revolution.  This also shows the weakness of the French government, which makes the people confident in a revolution.  This step leads to many different steps needed to revolutionize a country. ~tony's
Human Service is a seperate academic discipline from social work and more information is needed to explain the differences between the two fields.\\n\\n\\nHuman services is the study of social technologies (models and methods of practice) and service technologies (programs and systems) that work at the micro-, mezzo-, and macro-levels of society.\\n\\nThe mission of human services is to advance autonomy of service users, to help build social capital and civic engagement, to make informal or formal human service systems more egalitarian, efficient and effective, and to advocate for positive social change at all levels of society by any means necessary.  \\n\\nThe academic discipline of human services takes a multidisciplinary approach and focuses on practical solutions to complex social welfare problems of the whole person, community, and the global society.
Power Electronics Education E-Book\\n\\nwww.peeeb.com\\n\\nDr. Firuz Zare\\n\\n'Globalization' is a simple way of describing the spread of communication and technologies across the world. As the store of knowledge expands throughout the world, all of the world’s people should have as much access as possible. There are a range of new technologies and techniques such as the Internet, World Wide Web and other electronic media forms that allow for the dissemination of data, information and knowledge. These advanced information and communications technologies can provide a new learning system that aid professors and students in breaking the boundaries of space and time and assist students in gaining the skills and abilities and utilise knowledge contained in various forms in our global. I believe there is a need for enhanced virtual and networked activity to support learning and share our knowledge especially in some developing countries! After many years working in industry and university, I have decided to share my knowledge and experience with all students in the world who study Electrical Engineering. Now, it is not a dream anymore! In this website, you can virtually attend my lectures, tutorials, computer Labs and quizzes and also access to lecture notes.
ALIA Institute\\n\\nThe ALIA Institute is a non-profit charitable organization located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It aims to support community and organizational leaders by bringing together systems-oriented tools and perspectives with the values and practices of authentic leadership. \\n\\nThe Institute began in 1998 as a dialogue among members of the Shambhala meditation community who were actively engaged in business, education, and civil society, and pioneering leaders in the fields of organizational and societal change - pathfinders such as Peter Senge, Margaret Wheatley, Juanita Brown, David Isaacs, and Art Kleiner. The intention behind this exploration was to discover a new model of leadership development that would adequately prepare organizational leaders for the challenges of the 21st century. This model would bring together Shambhala, as a source of pre-industrial wisdom and practices for realizing the potential of individuals and societies, with post-industrial research and methodologies related to leadership and whole-systems change.\\n\\nThis fusion turned out to be a powerful support for more effective action, especially in the domains of innovation, strategy, collaboration, and large-scale transformative change. It resulted in the week-long Authentic Leadership Summer Program, which was first offered in Nova Scotia in June 2001 and which has convened annually ever since.
The Change in female labor force in the United States and the introduction of the contraceptive pill\\n\\nFrom 1890 to mid 1970, although the female labor force participation in the states has increased steadily, most female workers were secondary earners and worked as secretaries, teachers, nurses etc. However, started from mid 1970, “quiet revolution” took place. Women not only participated in labor force, they also began to have long-term investment in graduate education and became career oriented. For example, in the 1970s, women increased to major in business administration and reduced their concentration on traditional female fields of education, such as home economics education and education. Women also began to further their education in professional schools at around 1970 (Goldin 10). \\n\\nIn fact, according to professor Claudia Goldin, one of the main reasons that women changed to be career oriented in 1970 was the introduction of the contraceptive pill. Contraceptive pill was approved and diffused among young women in the late 1960s and early 1970s. With the introduction of the pill, women increased the age of first marriage (Goldin 10-11). More importantly, the birth control pill provides a right and power for women to actively decide whether to have a child or not. \\n\\nReference: \\nGoldin, Claudia. “The Quiet Revolution That Transformed Women’s Employment, Education, and Family” (May 2006)
'''SCHOLAR RESCUE FUND'''\\n\\nEvery day scholars in some part of the world are threatened, harassed, arrested, tortured or even killed by governments, militants, and extremists of all types who see scholars’ efforts to promote thinking, dialogue, and wider understanding as threats to their authority and control. \\n\\n'''ESTABLISHING THE FUND'''\\n\\nAround the world, scholars have long suffered harassment, torture and persecution as a result of their work. In the worst cases, scholars pay with their lives for their dedication to scholarship and freedom of thought. In the post-Cold War era, the need to protect scholars has only increased.\\n\\nIn response to this ongoing international dilemma, the Institute of International Education (IIE), under the leadership of trustees Dr. Henry Jarecki and Thomas Russo, along with George Soros’ Open Society Institute, launched the Scholar Rescue Fund (SRF). The Fund provides fellowships to support temporary visits by threatened scholars to institutions in any safe country, anywhere in the world. \\n\\nThese fellowships support temporary academic positions at safe universities and colleges anywhere in the world. SRF scholars contribute to their host universities through teaching, research, lectures and other activities. In return, host universities provide professional guidance and financial and in-kind support. Scholars from any country may qualify.  At the end of their fellowships, scholars return to help rebuild countries ravaged by conflict, repression and fear. When safe return is not possible, SRF staff work with scholars to identify opportunities to continue their work abroad.\\n\\nIn 2002, the Institute’s trustees committed to making scholar rescue a permanent part of its work.  The Scholar Rescue Fund builds on work done by the Institute since its founding in 1919.  By assuring that persecuted scholars can get to a safe place and continue their work, we shine the light on those who would terrorize them and in the process threaten world peace.  We also help to preserve the intellectual capital of humanity, which is vital for progress.
\\n\\nThe great california became a country in 2007. The president [['''Mark Yudof''']] helped the country in many amazing ways. he helps with the economic troubles and all of the difficulties california has had in the past. The administration that he works with will seek to get around those rulings through a complex gas tax swap. As part of the scheme, an existing sales tax on gasoline would be eliminated and, at the same time, a new per-gallon excise tax would be imposed. The price at the pump would drop about 5 cents per gallon.\\n\\nThe shift would gut a voter-approved measure, Proposition 42, that protects how current gas taxes are spent. Public transit -- buses, rail and other forms of mass transportation -- now receives 20% of all gas sales tax. After the tax swap, that requirement would disappear. The tax swap could also cost schools -- as it would result in the share of tax revenues they are entitled to under state law dropping by more than $800 million.\\n\\nTo read more, click here.\\n \\nPPIC Report Analyzes How Counties are Dealing with Fiscal Crisis\\nDec. 21 -- The Public Policy Institute of California has released a report titled "Perceptions of Local Fiscal Stress During a State Budget Crisis,"  which details how California counties and cities are dealing with their own current fiscal crises.\\n\\nAccording to the report"s summary, "City and county governments in California have been hit hard by the state's recent budgetary and economic difficulties.

KSDF’S STATEMENT ON INTERNATIONAL DAY OF ACTION FOR RIVERS\\n\\nDated: New Delhi, 14 March 2008\\n\\nOn this day, the 11th International Day of Action for Rivers, the Kuki Students Democratic Front and the Burma Rivers Network are calling for an end to the destructive Tamanthi Dam and all other mega dams in Burma. \\n\\nIndian, Chinese, and Thai companies are planning large dams across all of Burma’s major rivers and their tributaries. In collaboration with the Government of India, the 1,200 megawatt “Tamanthi Dam and Multi Purpose Project” is being implemented since 2005 by Indian Government in collaboration with National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC). This project is in the heart of ethnic Kuki inhabited areas in Sagaing Division, where the local people from the dam site Tazone Shan and Leivomjang Kuki village have already been relocated from their ancestral land and many more villages to be relocate if the construction is to be continues. \\n\\nThe dam will adversely affect the rich biodiversity and ecological balance in the region due to dramatic changes in the morphology of the riverbed. Burma’s Tamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary that provides habitat for many endemic species of flora and fauna will also be impacted. From 1990 to 2005, Burma lost 18% of its forest cover due to damming and logging. This is one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world. \\n\\nIn recent years, Chinese companies have been involved in the planning of 25 large dams on the Irrawaddy, Salween, and Sittaung rivers or their tributaries. The dams have an estimated combined capacity of 30,000 megawatts and represent US$30 billion worth of investment. Large-scale displacement, militarization, human rights abuse, and irreversible environmental damage due to the dam projects are threatening the livelihoods and food security of millions. \\n\\nThe bulk of the electricity generated from these projects is slated to be exported to neighbouring countries or will be consumed by military bases. Revenues from the sale of electricity will provide significant long-term income to the military regime which spends 40% of its budget on defense while the expenditure on health and education is below 5%.\\n\\nThe number of military battalions stationed near dam site areas has tripled in the last ten years. In areas where many of the dams are being implemented war continues to take a heavy toll or serious tensions threaten the ceasefires with ethnic groups. At the same time, the crackdown on peaceful demonstrations of monks in late 2007 clearly shows the impossibility of public participation in decisions over energy policies in Burma.\\n\\nDam projects in Burma are going ahead without regard for internationally accepted standards laid out by the World Commission on Dams and the Equator Principles, which include public participation in decision making, effective environmental mitigation, and equitable benefit sharing. Therefore the Tamanthi Dam and all other mega dams in Burma must be stopped.\\n\\nKuki Students Democratic Front (KSDF)\\nBurma Rivers Network (BRN)\\n\\n\\n\\nBy. Mangneo
Introduction\\n\\nDifferential equations arise in many areas of science and technology; whenever a deterministic relationship involving some continuously changing quantities (modeled by functions) and their rates of change (expressed as derivatives) is known or postulated. This is well illustrated by classical mechanics, where the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time varies. Newton's Laws allow one to relate the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body and state this relation as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time. In many cases, this differential equation may be solved, yielding the law of motion.\\n\\nDifferential equations are mathematically studied from several different perspectives, mostly concerned with their solutions, functions that make the equation hold true. Only the simplest differential equations admit solutions given by explicit formulas. Many properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without finding their exact form. If a self-contained formula for the solution is not available, the solution may be numerically approximated using computers. The theory of dynamical systems puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations, while many numerical methods have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy.
The Resource Based Economy Foundation (RBEF) is a group of people with a common vision from various geographical locations. Our goal is to address the root causes that lead to the economic, ecological, and ethical problems that we see in the world today and by this contribute to a societal paradigm shift by depriving the negative effects of their causation. Our efforts are directed at removing the cause rather than being wasted on remedying the effects. \\n\\nThe RBEF is concerned with establishing legal and operational guidelines that will enable people and communities throughout the globe to achieve mutual cooperation and through that eliminate social, environmental, political, and economic restrictions that prevent humanity from progressing. RBEF is a set of tools for the transition from the Monetary System to Resource Based Economy and provides research on the transition economy model, develops global resource based projects, and a libre resources management platform. \\n\\nWe believe that the current economic setup creates more problems than provides solutions as can be noticed by following the very recent national and international events. Economy, in order to function, relies on the upholding of artificial goods scarcity which is maintained by various mechanisms known as "planned obsolescence", "abundance of scarcity", "priority of profit", "distortion of values", and "fiscal manipulation". All those mechanisms reflect negatively on environmental health, employment rates, economy, crime rates, moral values, standards of living, and life itself. The effects can be seen by the growing gap between rich and poor, which at the end only benefits the smallest part of humanity while destroying the remaining human lives, fauna and flora. \\n\\nWe understand the need for public presence and raising of awareness of fellow humans. Nevertheless, it is of utmost importance that we learn to understand the fundamental root causes of totalitarian institutions that lead to the current unacceptable form of society all over the world. Those fundamental causes include the misunderstanding about human behavior that creates and supports the economic dictatorships in power, and the erroneous design of the monetary economy that, a priori, must lead to stratification and a widening gap between economic classes, and unemployment, just to name the two major effects. \\n\\nOur tools to achieve a global prospering society are the creation of global awareness, education, understanding today's possibilities for technical solutions, and the application of the scientific method in order for humanity to invert this vicious cycle we find ourselves in today. \\n\\nWe work with the principles of openness and transparency including the use of today's already existing elements of resource-based economy ranging from open source software, through open content licenses, to open design of the transition plan. Following the principle "everyone is a leader", we have simply started implementing solutions, which we anticipate to become useful for humanity at large. \\n\\nFurther, we stress non-violent action by avoiding "us versus them" attitudes, and probably the most critical of all, giving people a positive prospect of the future. For this reason, we believe that it is important to point the beacon towards the ideas that have already liberated the awareness of approximately a million people world-wide, according to current estimates.

\\nSALTY Magazine is a free-online publication targeted to a young generation of Christian disciples to be "the salt of the earth," (Matthew5:13). \\n\\nwww.saltymagazine.com\\n\\nIn ancient times, salt was an essential ingredient in mixtures for its purifying, cleansing, and preserving qualities. This resulted in those who live according to God’s word being called “the salt of the earth.” Therefore, SALTY magazine is dedicated to displaying the invaluable purpose young Christians have in today’s society as preservers of truth, beauty, justice and purity. We also explore, challenge and redefine what it means to be young and submitted to God’s will. The pages of the magazine are filled with thought-provoking articles, inspirational testimonies, and fresh features tackling issues our generation face today.
Waterspouts exist on a microscale, where their environment is less than two kilometers in width. Their bigger cloud that develops them can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus, or as great as a supercell. While some waterspouts are strong (tornadic) like their land-based counterparts, most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics. They normally develop in moisture-laden environments with little vertical wind shear along lines of convergence, such as land breezes, lake effect bands, lines of frictional convergence from nearby landmasses, or surface troughs. Waterspouts normally develop as their parent clouds are in the process of development, and it is theorized that they spin up as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal shear near the surface, and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus or thunderstorm. Weak tornadoes, known as landspouts, have been shown to develop in a similar manner.[2]

"Anorexia mirabilis literally means "miraculous lack of appetite". It refers almost exclusively to women and girls of the Middle Ages who would starve themselves, sometimes to the death, in the name of God. The phenomenon is also known by the name "inedia prodigiosa" (a great starvation).[1]\\n\\nAnorexia mirabilis differs from the more modern, well-known anorexia nervosa in several distinct ways.\\n\\nIn anorexia nervosa, people usually starve themselves to attain a level of thinness, as the disease is associated with body image distortion. By contrast, anorexia mirabilis was frequently coupled with other ascetic practices, such as lifelong chastity, flagellant behavior, the donning of hairshirts, sleeping on beds of thorns, and other assorted self mutilations. It was largely a practice of Catholic women, who were often known as "miraculous maids".\\n\\nUntil recently, plumpness was a clear sign of affluence, and emaciation either a sign of poverty, ill health, or both. Women did not typically begin depriving themselves of food for outer beauty until the Victorian era, they did however starve themselves for spiritual fulfillment."
''New data on Mars's underground ice shows that the red planet likely has a very active water cycle.  Using heat emission observations from the Mars Odyssey spacecraft, researchers were able to map seasonal changes in the temperature of the red planet's surface to locate and measure the buried ice.   "This gives us a more detailed picture of the underground ice on Mars," said Joshua Bandfield, a research specialist at Arizona State University's School of Earth and Space Exploration in Tempe, who led the study.  The findings, which are reported in the May 3 issue of the journal Nature, show that the depth of the water-ice table varies greatly on Mars.  The results also suggest that water ice and water vapor in the planet's atmosphere can swap places as the planet undergoes regular cycles of warming and cooling.
{{failed}}\\n\\nAmong those who have spent significant amounts of time editing on Wikipedia are those who have had the misfortune of dealing with Administrators who have gone far beyond their administrative role of applying Wikipedia policy and respecting consensus, and have granted themselves authority to dictate Wikipedia policy as they see fit, regardless of consensus.

With current Wikipedia policy giving admins a lifetime sinecure, and the only means of disciplining admins in the hands of their fellow admins, there is no effective control over those who have exceeded their authority.\\n\\nWhile other reforms are desperately needed, the key proposal suggested here is to limit administrators to a renewable one-year term of office requiring renewal by a supermajority of Wikipedia editors.

{{Business administration}}\\n{{short description|Trade of goods, services, technology, capital's and/or knowledge at a transnational scale}}\\n'''International business''' refers to the trade of Goods and service goods, services, technology, capital and/or knowledge across national borders and at a global or transnational scale. \\n\\nIt involves cross-border [[Financial transaction|transactions]] of goods and services between two or more countries. Transactions of economic resources include capital, skills, and people for the purpose of the international production of physical goods and services such as finance, banking, insurance, and construction. International business is also known as [[globalization]].\\n\\nInternational business encompasses a myriad of crucial elements vital for global economic integration and growth. At its core, it involves the exchange of goods, services, and capital across national borders. One of its pivotal aspects is globalization, which has significantly altered the landscape of trade by facilitating increased interconnectedness between nations. International business thrives on the principle of comparative advantage, wherein countries specialize in producing goods and services they can produce most efficiently. This specialization fosters efficiency, leading to optimal resource allocation and higher overall productivity. Moreover, international business fosters cultural exchange and understanding by promoting interactions between people of diverse backgrounds. However, it also poses challenges, such as navigating complex regulatory frameworks, cultural differences, and geopolitical tensions. Effective international business strategies require astute market analysis, risk assessment, and adaptation to local customs and preferences. The role of technology cannot be overstated, as advancements in communication and transportation have drastically reduced barriers to entry and expanded market reach. Additionally, international business plays a crucial role in sustainable development, as companies increasingly prioritize ethical practices, environmental responsibility, and social impact. Collaboration between governments, businesses, and international organizations is essential to address issues like climate change, labor rights, and economic inequality. In essence, international business is a dynamic force driving economic growth, fostering global cooperation, and shaping the future of commerce on a worldwide scale.\\n\\nTo conduct business overseas, multinational companies need to bridge separate national [[Market (economics)|markets]] into one global marketplace. There are two macro-scale factors that underline the trend of greater globalization. The first consists of eliminating [[Trade barrier|barriers]] to make cross-border trade easier (e.g. free flow of goods and services, and capital, referred to as "[[free trade]]"). The second is technological change, particularly developments in communication, [[Electronic data processing|information processing]], and [[Freight transport|transportation]] technologies.\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nThe discourse surrounding international business has  a transition in terminology over the years, reflecting shifts in understanding and the expanding scope of cross-border commerce. Initially, phrases such as "foreign trade" and "foreign exchange" were prevalent, embodying a static view of cross-border interactions. However, the term "foreign" often evoked notions of remoteness or strangeness, failing to capture the dynamic essence of international engagements.\\n\\nAs commerce evolved with the advent of firms engaging in substantial direct investments across borders, newer terms  to encapsulate the changing landscape. The mid-19th century marked the rise of companies owning and controlling production facilities in various countries, a departure from the earlier norm where firms held minor or passive ("portfolio") investments abroad. This paradigm shift necessitated a fresh nomenclature, leading to the introduction of the term "multinational enterprise" (MNE), referring to entities with substantial operations in multiple nations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burleigh |first1=Thomas D. |title=The Indian Tree Pipit (Anthus hodgsoni) Recorded for the First Time in North America |journal=The Auk |date=1968 |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=323 |doi=10.2307/4083598 |jstor=4083598 }}</ref>\\n\\n"International business" is also defined as the study of the internationalization process of multinational enterprises. A [[multinational enterprise]] (MNE) is a company that has a worldwide approach to markets, production and/or operations in several countries. Well-known MNEs include fast-food companies such as: McDonald's (MCD), YUM (YUM), Starbucks Coffee Company (SBUX), etc. Other industrial MNEs leaders include vehicle manufacturers such as: Ford Motor Company, and General Motors (GMC). Some consumer electronics producers such as Samsung, LG and Sony, and energy companies such as Exxon Mobil, and British Petroleum (BP) are also multinational enterprises.\\n\\nMultinational enterprises range from any kind of business activity or market, from consumer goods to machinery manufacture; a company can become an international business. Therefore, to conduct business overseas, companies should be aware of all the factors that might affect any business activities, including, but not limited to: difference in legal systems, political systems, [[economic policy]], [[language barrier|language]], [[accounting standard]]s, [[International labour law|labor standards]], living standards, [[environmental standard]]s, [[culture|local culture]]s, [[Organizational culture|corporate cultures]], [[Foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange markets]], [[tariff]]s, [[import]] and [[export]] regulations, [[trade agreement]]s, [[climate]], and [[education]]. Each of these factors may require changes in how companies operate from one country to another. Each factor makes a difference and a connection.\\n\\nOne of the first scholars to engage in developing a theory of multinational companies was Canadian economist [[Stephen Hymer]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Buckley |first1=Peter J. |title=Stephen Hymer: Three phases, one approach? |journal=International Business Review |date=April 2006 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=140–147 |doi=10.1016/j.ibusrev.2005.03.008 }}</ref> Throughout his academic life, he developed theories that sought to explain [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) and why firms become multinational.\\n\\nThere were three phases of [[internationalization]] according to Hymer's work.<ref>{{cite thesis |last1=Hymer |first1=Stephen H. |title=The international operations of national firms, a study of direct foreign investment |date=1960 |hdl=1721.1/27375 |hdl-access=free }}{{pn|date=March 2024}}</ref> In this thesis, the author departs from [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical theory]] and opens up a new area of international production. At first, Hymer started analyzing neoclassical theory and [[financial investment]], where the main reason for [[capital movement]] is the [[Interest rate parity|difference in interest rates]]. After this analysis, Hymer analyzed the characteristics of foreign investment by large companies for [[Production (economics)|production]] and direct business purposes, calling this Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). By analyzing the two types of investments, Hymer distinguished financial investment from direct investment. The main distinguishing feature was control. [[Portfolio investment]] is a more passive approach, and the main purpose is [[Profit (economics)|financial gain]], whereas in foreign direct investment a firm has control over the [[Operations management|operations]] abroad. So, the traditional theory of investment based on differential interest rates does not explain the motivations for FDI.\\n\\nAccording to Hymer, there are two main determinants of FDI; where an [[imperfect market]] structure is the key element. The first is the [[Competitive advantage|firm-specific advantages]] which are developed at the specific companies home country and, profitably, used in the foreign country. The second determinant is the removal of control where Hymer wrote: "When firms are interconnected, they [[Competition (economics)|compete]] in selling in the same market or one of the firms may sell to the other," and because of this "it may be profitable to substitute centralized decision-making for [[decentralized decision-making]]".\\n\\nHymer's second phase is his neoclassical article in 1968 that includes a theory of internationalization and explains the direction of growth of the international expansion of firms. In a later stage, Hymer went to a more [[Marxian economics|Marxist]] approach where he explains that MNC as agents of an international capitalist system causing conflict and contradictions, causing among other things [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[poverty]] in the world. Hymer is the "father of the theory of MNEs", and explains the motivations for companies doing direct business abroad.\\n\\nAmong modern economic theories of multinationals and foreign direct investment are [[internalization theory]] and [[John Harry Dunning|John Dunning's]] [[Eclectic paradigm|OLI paradigm]] (standing for ''ownership, location and internationalization''). Dunning was widely known for his research in economics of international direct investment and the multinational enterprise. His OLI paradigm, in particular, remains as the predominant theoretical contribution to study international business topics. Hymer and Dunning are considered [[Organizational founder|founders]] of international business as a specialist [[field of study]].\\n\\n==Physical and social factors of competitive business and social environment==\\nThe conduct of international operations depends on a company's objectives and the means with which they carry them out. The operations affect and are affected by the physical and societal factors and the [[competitive]] [[social environment|environment]].\\n\\n===Operations===\\nAll firms that want to go international have one goal in common; the desire to increase their respective [[Economic value added|economic values]] when engaging in international trade transactions. To accomplish this goal, each firm must develop its individual strategy and approach to maximize [[Value (economics)|value]], lower costs, and increase profits.  A firm's value creation is the difference between {{Math|''V''}} (the value of the product being sold) and {{Math|''C''}} (the cost of production per each product sold).{{sfn|Hill|2014|p=382}}\\n\\n[[Value creation]] can be categorized as: ''primary activities'' ([[research and development]], production, marketing and sales, [[customer service]]) and as ''support activities'' (information systems, logistics, human resources).{{sfn|Hill|2014|p=383}} All of these activities must be managed effectively and be consistent with the [[Corporate strategy|firm strategy]]. However, the success of firms that extend internationally depends on the goods or services sold and on the firm's core competencies (Skills within the firm that competitors cannot easily match or imitate). For a firm to be successful, the firm's strategy must be consistent with the environment in which the firm operates. Therefore, the firm needs to change its [[organizational structure]] to reflect changes in the setting in which they are operating and the strategy they are pursuing.\\n\\nOnce a firm decides to enter a foreign market, it must decide on a mode of entry. There are six different modes to enter a foreign market, and each mode has [[wiktionary:pros and cons|pros and cons]] that are associated with it. The firm must decide which mode is most appropriately aligned with the company's goals and objectives.  The six different modes of entry are exporting,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp|title=Export|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-19|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}</ref> [[turnkey project]]s, [[License|licensing]], [[franchising]], establishing [[joint venture]]s with a host-country firm, or setting up a new [[wholly owned subsidiary]] in the host country.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=453–454}}\\n\\nThe first entry mode is [[exporting]]. Exporting is the sale of a product in a different national market than a centralized hub of manufacturing. In this way, a firm may realize a substantial [[Economies of scale|scale of economies]] from its global sales revenue. As an example, many [[Automotive industry in Japan|Japanese automakers]] made inroads into the [[Automotive industry in the United States|U.S. market]] through exporting.  There are two primary advantages to exporting:  avoiding high costs of establishing manufacturing in a host country (when these are higher) and gaining an [[Experience curve effects|experience curve]].  Some possible disadvantages to exporting are high transport costs and high [[Tariff|tariff barriers]].{{sfn|Hill|2014|p=454}}\\n\\nThe second entry mode is a turnkey project. In a turnkey project, an independent contractor is hired by the company to oversee all of the preparation for entering a foreign market.  Once the preparation is complete and the end of the contract is reached, the plant is turned over to the company fully ready for operation.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=454–455}}\\n\\nLicensing and franchising are two additional entry modes that are similar in operation. Licensing allows a [[licensor]] to grant the rights to an intangible property to the licensee for a specified period of time for a royalty fee. Franchising, on the other hand, is a specialized form of licensing in which the "franchisor" sells the [[intangible property]] to the franchisee, and also requires the franchisee operate as dictated by the franchisor.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=456–457}}\\n\\nLastly, a joint venture and wholly owned subsidiary are two more entry modes in international business. A ''joint venture'' is when a firm created is jointly owned by two or more companies (Most joint venture are 50-50 [[partnership]]s). This is in contrast with a wholly owned subsidiary, when a firm owns 100 percent of the [[Capital stock|stock]] of a company in a foreign country because it has either set up a new operation or [[Corporate acquisition|acquires]] an established firm in that country.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=457–458}}\\n\\n====Types of operations====\\n[[Export]]s and [[import]] \\n* Merchandise exports: goods exported{{Em dash}}not including services.<ref>[http://thelawdictionary.org/merchandise-exports/ What is Merchandised Exports].

The effect of exchange-rate and interest rate make it difficult to conduct international business."<ref name="okolo2"/> Moreover, it can be a risk for a company to operate in a country and they may experience an unexpected economic crisis after establishing the subsidiary.<ref name=heinsz /> Economic risks is the likelihood that economic management will cause drastic changes in a country's business environment that hurt the profit and other goals of a business enterprise. In practice, the biggest problem arising from economic mismanagement has been inflation. Historically many governments have expanded their domestic money supplying misguided attempts to stimulate economic activity.<ref name="Charles H.L Hill"/>\\n* '''Financial risk'''\\n\\nAccording to Professor Okolo: "This area is affected by the currency exchange rate, government flexibility in allowing the firms to [[Repatriation|repatriate]] profits or funds outside the country. The [[devaluation]] and inflation will also affect the firm's ability to operate at an efficient capacity and still be stable."<ref name="okolo2"/> Furthermore, the [[tax]]es that a company has to pay might be advantageous or not. It might be higher or lower in the host countries. Then "the risk that a government will indiscriminately change the laws, regulations, or contracts governing an investment—or will fail to [[Enforcement|enforce]] them—in a way that reduces an investor's [[financial return]]s is what we call 'policy risk.'"<ref name=heinsz /> Exchange rates can fluctuate rapidly for a variety of reasons, including economic instability and diplomatic issues. <ref>{{cite web |title=These Are Four Risks of Doing International Business |url=https://www.bnsgoglobal.com/four-risks-of-doing-international-business/ |website=Business Navigational Solutions |date=27 March 2022 |access-date=3 May 2022}}</ref>\\n* '''Terrorism'''\\n\\n[[Terrorism]] is a voluntary act of violence towards a group(s) of people. In most cases, acts of terrorism is derived from hatred of religious, political and cultural beliefs. An example was the infamous [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], labeled as terrorism due to the [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks|massive damages]] inflicted on [[Society of the United States|American society]] and the global economy stemming from the animosity towards [[Western culture]] by some [[Radical Islam|radical Islamic groups]]. Terrorism not only affects civilians, but it also damages corporations and other businesses. These effects may include: physical [[vandalism]] or [[destruction of property]], sales declining due to frightened consumers and governments issuing public safety restrictions. Firms engaging in international business will find it difficult to operate in a country that has an uncertain assurance of safety from these attacks.<ref name="okolo2"/>\\n* '''Bribery'''\\n\\n[[Bribery]] is the act of receiving or soliciting of any items or services of value to influence the actions of a party with public or legal obligations. This is considered to an unethical form of practicing business and can have legal repercussions. Firm that want to operate legally should instruct employees to not involve themselves or the company in such activities. Companies should avoid doing business in countries where unstable forms of government exist as it could bring unfair advantages against domestic business and/or harm the social fabric of the citizens.\\n\\n==Factors towards globalization==\\nThere has been growth in [[globalization]] in recent decades due to the following factors.\\n\\n{{List incomplete|date=November 2018}}\\n\\n*[[Technology]] is expanding, especially in [[transportation]] and [[communications]].\\n*[[Governments]] are removing international business restrictions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\\n*[[Institutions]] provide services to ease the conduct of international business.\\n*[[Consumer]]s want to know about [[Foreign trade|foreign]] [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[service (economics)|services]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\\n*[[Competition]] has become more global.\\n*[[Political]] relationships have improved among some major [[economic]] powers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\\n*[[Countries]] cooperate more on transnational issues.\\n*[[Cross-national cooperation and agreements]] have increased.\\n\\n==Importance of international business education==\\n* Most companies are either international companies or [[Competition (economics)|compete]] with other international companies.\\n* Modes of [[Business operations|operation]] may differ from those used domestically.\\n* The best way of conducting business may differ by [[country]].\\n* An understanding helps one make better [[career]] decisions.\\n* An understanding helps one decide what [[Government policy|governmental policies]] to support.\\n\\nManagers in international business must understand [[social science]] disciplines and how they affect different functional business fields.\\n\\nTo maintain and achieve successful business operations in foreign nations, persons must understand how variations in culture and traditions across nations affect business practices. This idea is known as [[cultural literacy]]. Without knowledge of a host country's culture, corporate strategizing is more difficult and error-prone when entering foreign markets compared with the home country's market and culture. This can create a "blind spot" during the decision making process and result in [[ethnocentrism]]. Education about international business introduces the student to new concepts that can be applicable in international strategy in topics such as marketing and operations.\\n\\n===Importance of language and cultural studies===\\n\\nA considerable advantage in international business is gained through the knowledge and use of language, thereby mitigating a [[language barrier]]. A study by Lohmann (2011) in ''Economics Letters'' delved into the impact of language barriers on trade. The findings suggest that fluency in the local language can significantly enhance trade interactions.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lohmann |first=Johannes |date=2011-02-01 |title=Do language barriers affect trade? |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176510003617 |journal=Economics Letters |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=159–162 |doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2010.10.023 |issn=0165-1765}}</ref> Advantages of being an international businessperson who is [[Fluency|fluent]] in the [[local language]] include the following:\\n*Having the ability to directly communicate with employees and customers\\n*Understanding the manner of speaking within business in the local area to improve overall [[productivity]]\\n*Gaining respect of customers and employees from speaking with them in their native tongue\\n\\nIn many cases, it plays a crucial role. It is truly impossible to gain an understanding of a culture's buying habits without first taking the time to understand the culture.  Examples of the benefit of understanding local culture include the following:\\n*Being able to provide marketing techniques that are specifically tailored to the local market\\n*Knowing how other businesses operate and what might or might not be social taboos \\n*Understanding the time structure of an area.  Some societies are more focused on timeliness ("[[Punctuality|being on time]]") while others focus on doing business at "[[Business hours|the right time]]".\\n*Associating with people who do not know several languages.\\n*Language barriers can affect transaction costs. ''[[Linguistic distance]]'' is defined as the amount of variation one language has from another. For example, French, and Spanish are both languages derived from Latin. When evaluating dialogue in these languages, you will discover many similarities. However, languages such as English and Chinese or English and Arabic vary much more strongly and contain far fewer similarities. The [[writing system]]s of these languages are also different. The larger the linguistic distance there, the wider language barriers to cross. These differences can reflect on transaction costs and make foreign business operations more expensive.\\n\\n===Importance of studying international business===\\n\\nThe international business standards focus on the following:\\n*raising awareness of the inter-relatedness of one country's political policies and economic practices on another;\\n*learning to improve international business relations through appropriate communication strategies;\\n*understanding the global business environment—that is, the interconnections of cultural, political, legal, economic, and ethical systems;\\n*exploring basic concepts underlying [[international finance]], [[management]], [[marketing]], and trade relations; and\\n*identifying forms of business [[ownership]] and international business opportunities.\\nBy focusing on these, students will gain a better understanding of [[Political economy]]. These are tools that would help future business people bridge the economic and political gap between countries.\\n\\nThere is an increasing amount of demand for business people with an education in international business. A survey conducted by Thomas Patrick from [[University of Notre Dame]] concluded that [[bachelor's degree]] and [[master's degree]] holders felt that the training received through education were very practical in the working environment. Increasingly, companies are sourcing their human resource requirement globally. For example, at [[Sony|Sony Corporation]], only fifty percent of its employees are Japanese.<ref>{{Cite book|title=INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS|author=ASWATHAPPA|year=2003 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9781259051166}}</ref> Business people with an education in international business also had a significantly higher chance of being sent abroad to work under the international operations of a firm.\\n\\nThe following table provides descriptions of [[higher education]] in international business and its benefits.\\n{| class="wikitable"\\n|-\\n!  !!

Flipgigs is an online talent based student services marketplace connecting savvy consumers and businesses with an affordable network of talented , motivated, scrappy students from High Schools and Colleges who are eager to take on part-time jobs and gigs. \\n\\nFlipgigs was founded in the Spring of 2011 by Jayati Sengupta. According to Angel Investor Ron Conway, the most thought-provoking sector to develop in 2012 is the proliferation of peer-to-peer markets and the emergence of “collaborative consumption”. The age of so-lo-mo explosion has made it easier to share anything from resources to skills to assets and services.We are seeing a big shift in human relationships in the aftermath of web success in Facebook and LinkedIn era and I think this is just the beginning. A social platform like Flipgigs has the potential to very powerful. While everything else seems to be plummeting in today's tough economic times, one thing that continues to rise is the sticker price of college education. Moreover, with the stock market slump, the vast majority of parents are finding it extremely tough to dip into their dwindling retirement savings . Also, the student loan bubble is another bomb waiting to explode just like the housing mortgage crisis. That is where talent comes in. We already know students are very connected, resourceful and talented. We need a platform like Flipgigs to tap into this talent and have them find gigs easily. Students today need to start to wear a PIY attitude.(pay-it yourself)
As a person, I am an undergraduate linguistics researcher.  My languages of interest include: English, Italian, Emiliano-Romagnolo, and Persian.  My subjects of interest are Phonology, Phonotactics, Dialectology, Romance Ling, Historical Ling, Computational Ling, Lexicostatistics, and Cognitive Ling.\\n<br />\\nAs a Wikipedian, I am primarily interested in editing pages associated with languages and linguistics.  Linguistics, like other academic fields, contains individuals with many passionate opinions on the nature and theory of language.  Wikipedia should not be a soapbox for the advocacy of a particular theory.  However, I think it is important to present all existing theories so that people can make up their minds for themselves.  It becomes tedious and cluttery in Wikipedia to present every theory on a topic with its own list of pros and cons, however sometimes it is important to understand the line of reasoning in which a theory is discredited in the gradual evolution of scientific knowledge.\\n<br />\\nWikipedia has become the symbol of the 21st century age of information.  In milliseconds a vast medium of free information is available to everyone.  I want to contribute to wikipedia and participate in its gradual expansion.
Currently I am making contributions for several reasons: I want to practice my writing skills and request comment and feedback from other contributors as a means of improving my writing. I have read through Wikipedia's guidelines about quality and find it nearly impossible to digest all of it. Instead, small steps with criticism might be more productive. Secondly, I am interested in how the English speaking world has acted, reacted, and interacted with other parts of the world. My recent contributions focus on an Indian guru,  a newspaper editor, British colonial officials, a Togolese writer, and a Dutch-Indonesian writer.  I explore how these interactions shape and re-shape the English language. I see them as contributions to the most studied language in the world. Finally, I need to become more competent with the technical dimensions of writing, such as citing reliable sources, notability criteria, references and so forth. One of the most challenging things about Wikipedia is the opportunity to expand the notability criteria.
Low-cost terminal\\n\\nThis term is usually applied to a terminal building at an airport, which offers only the most basic features associated with terminals. The advantage of this lies in rapid construction, simplicity in design, and across the range cheaper operating costs. \\n\\nTypical features of a low-cost terminal include:\\n\\n* Simple design \\n* Modularity - all internal functions are designed with future expansion in mind\\n* No air bridges - passengers either walk directly from the building to the departing aircraft, or are bussed to a remote stand\\n* Low development and operating costs - the operator of such a terminal usually aims to attract airlines by offering significantly lower costs to prospective tenants\\n* \\n\\nThese terminals have usually been born out of the demands from [[low-cost carrier]]s, who typically wish to turn around their aircraft in the shortest possible time.remote gates have proven to be the most efficient way of boarding and deplaning passengers.
I'm fascinated by [[energy]], both in the sense that the word is used in science and as it is applied in everyday life.\\nThe Wikipedia definition describes various ''forms'' of energy, but no-one seems to know what energy per se actually is. As I understand it, energy can't be created or destroyed, but it can change form, and matter is just one of these forms. This tells me that the energy I'm made of has always existed, and is the reason for my Wikipedia username.\\nMy own level of physical and mental energy varies from time to time, depending on the state of my health, what I eat and drink, the weather, what's happening around me and a host of other factors. \\nEnergy also drives civilisation and the global economy, which is why I believe climate change and peak oil are the biggest issues facing humanity.\\nBy the way, if anyone can tell me exactly what energy is, or explain that climate change or peak oil aren't worth worrying about, I'd be most grateful!
{{Userspace draft|Aeolian processes on Mars|date=April 2010}}\\nSand dunes have been observed throughout the surface of the planet Mars.  Movement of these dunes has been theorized and inferred from the lack of craters on dunes.  Dune movement has not yet been directly imaged, however.  Understanding sand movement processes is vital to a correct Martian climate model, as well as the safety of future missions to Mars.\\n\\n==Introduction==\\nOn Earth, sand is a very plentiful resource.  Wind, water and ice, as well as chemical reactions and biological activity, all serve to break apart rocks and other solid material into sand on a large scale.  While much of this sand is quickly stabilized by biological and hydrological processes, and converted into sedimentary rock, some of it, especially in desert climates where these influences are minimal, remains in the form of unconsolidated sand and dust for thousands of years or more, subject to influence by the wind.    \\nSand is an especially interesting material to study because of its granular nature.  When acted upon by wind, sand behaves in ways that, at first glance, seem peculiar.  Instead of being deposited evenly along a surface, sand self-accumulates into ripples, drifts, and dunes.  It can be piled high, but can only sustain slopes up to the material's angle of repose for the local gravitational force, beyond which the pile will undergo gravitational collapse.\\n\\nSand dunes cover an estimated 5,000,000 km2 of Earth’s surface (more than half the area of the United States), mostly in desert climes and along shorelines (Hayward et al., 2007).  Where surface sand dominates, it can present a serious hazard to machinery when made airborne.  For example, sand storms famously foiled President Jimmy Carter's attempt to rescue American hostages being held in Iran in 1980.  Granules of sand and dust are so small that they can sneak through microscopic gaps into the workings of complex machinery, causing serious malfunctions and short-circuits.  The abrasive action of airborne sand can damage or destroy structures and equipment alike.  Unchecked, dunes can cover and rend useless vitually anything downwind: roads, machinery, even entire settlements (Hayward et al., 2007; Jones, 2001).\\n\\nIt has been apparent that dunes exist on Mars since 1971, when Mariner 9 imaged the first extraterrestrial dune fields (Iverson, 1976).  Observations of extensive dune fields across the Red Planet in 1972, as well as the absence of any substantial liquid water or geological activity on the present Martian surface, make it clear that aeolian processes are indeed the dominant geomorphic forces which are shaping present-day Mars (Phillips, 1998).\\nThe United States’ “Vision for Space Exploration” includes stipulations for future exploration of Mars by both unmanned probes and crewed missions (Bush, 2004).  With a clear goal of establishing the presence of complicated machinery, where great expenditures and potentially the lives of astronauts will be at stake, it is absolutely essential to understand the mechanics of aeolian processes as they take place on Mars.  An essential part of this understanding would be determining the activity of the current Martian surface.\\n\\nDespite several successful lander and rover missions to Mars in the past few decades, as well as a steady improvement in the resolution of images taken from orbit, there is still no hard evidence of dune movement anywhere on present-day Mars (Williams, 2006).  This study sought to use available imagery from Mars orbiters and Opportunity rover to search for any dune movement.  The analysis concluded that saltation is likely occurring during the most severe storms on present day Mars, and that one saltation event likely occurred as recent as July, 2007.  However, no conclusive evidence for dune movement on present-day Mars was found.\\n\\n==Background==\\n\\n===The nature of sand on Earth===\\nDeserts cover approximately 20% of Earth’s surface, and sand covers 20% of Earth’s deserts (Watson, 1997).  Sand is created by the erosion of rock containing quartz, feldspar, or other hard minerals, as well as the erosion of coral and volcanic glass.  It is mainly found near seashores, where it is created by wave action, along rivers, where rocks frequently collide in strong currents, and in deserts, where it is created by aeolian processes.\\n\\nIt seems natural, when dealing with a problem of sand movement, to first define exactly what sand is.  Sand is a subset of all granular materials.  Granular materials can be as large as boulders, and can be as small as 1 µm (the scale where thermal vibration effects become significant).  Sand can be defined as any granular material which can be influenced by fluid flow, however, this definition must be restricted one degree further by putting a limit on the diameter of the material’s individual grains.  The need for this restriction is clear; while both a fine powder and a heap of boulders fit neatly into the granular material definition, they behave quite unlike traditional sand under a fluid in motion. A powder will be dispersed quite quickly and suspended under the action of a typical wind, while larger rocks will be entirely unaffected, disregarding abrasive erosion.\\n\\nThe definition of sand used by Bagnold is a very good general one for the purpose of dune study (Bagnold, 1941).  A lower limit for sand grain size can be found by investigating the behavior of a fluid flowing over a granular surface.  In natural situations, fluid flow is very rarely fully laminar; it will contain eddies, or “gusts”, which represent a local increase in wind speed and change in direction.  Some of these eddies will be in an upward direction, giving the potential for small particles to be suspended.  However, nearer to the ground, the upward and downward components of the eddies are weaker than other directions. While the intensity of these upward gusts is variable, it is commonly approximated as 20% of the mean wind velocity (Alghamdi and Akyurt, 2001).  Therefore, any particle with a terminal velocity lower than 0.2 times the mean wind velocity will be carried up and suspended indefinitely, provided the wind keeps up. Any particle which can achieve this suspension is defined as dust.\\n\\nAn upper limit for sand grain size is even easier to define.  Sand moves through two modes of transport: saltation and surface creep.  There is an additional mode, reptation, which is the minor saltation of sand grains physically dislodged by impacting particles, which typically do not have the energy to dislodge further grains (Lancaster, 1995; Parteli, 2007).  However, as is apparent by the definition, reptation is merely a subset of saltation, and so shall be included within this category.\\n\\nSaltation is the process where by sand grains actually become airborne, while surface creep is sand movement by which the grains never actually leave the ground.  At some upper limit, however, the combination of wind pressure and sand impact are no longer sufficient to move a grain of sufficient size.  Grains which remain stationary even in the most intense wind are defined as pebbles.  Therefore, any granular material which does not fall under the definition of dust or pebbles is sand.\\n\\nNatural sand never consists of uniformly-sized grains.  There will always be some natural variation in the size of sand grains, even those formed from the same rock and by the same process.  The distribution of sand grain sizes is known as the grading of the sand.\\n\\n===Nature of sand movement===\\nFluid-based sand transport takes place close to the planetary surface, within what is known as the boundary layer; the layer of wind above the ground where surface friction affects the local wind velocity.  Within the boundary layer, wind tends to vary logarithmically by height, defined by Equation 1.  \\n\\n	 	1\\n\\nThe terms used in this equation will be defined later, however there is an important term to point out now: u*, which is known as the shear velocity.  The shear velocity is not an actual velocity, but a mathematical parameter of a wind profile with units of velocity.  The shear velocity is constant for a given wind profile, so it is considered more convenient, in discussions of sand movement and other near-surface processes, to refer to boundary layer winds in terms of shear velocity rather than actual velocity.  \\n\\nA single grain can be moved in a variety of ways.  It can be moved as part of a sand avalanche on a slip face or it can be knocked forward along the ground (or even into the air) by an impacting airborne grain.  When analyzing the initiation of sand movement, however, it is necessary to study the case where a sand grain is moved by the direct pressure of the wind.\\n\\nA sand sheet is obviously stable under a fluid with no velocity.  At very low velocities, friction between individual grains in the sand sheet keeps them from moving.  However, as wind velocity increases, eventually drag and lift forces overcome the forces of friction and gravity keeping the sand grains in place, and the most exposed sand grains will become airborne (Lancaster, 1995).\\n\\nA grain lifted in this manner will likely have a small initial velocity in relation to the mean wind velocity at its initial height.  Therefore, the faster wind will impart some of its momentum upon this grain, possibly reaching an equilibrium, where the grain is moving at the local wind speed.  However, the airborne state of the sand particle is short-lived.  When the particle impacts the sand bed, it transfers its momentum, usually into several sand grains.  In this way, even grains not exposed enough or too large to be moved by the fluid threshold shear velocity may be dislodged and set in motion, which initiates a type of sand movement known as saltation.  Saltation is a mode of sand movement involving short jumps by individual particles, and is the process by which approximately 75% of sand movement occurs (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\nWhen the grain impacts the sand bed, it creates a splash, which is the propulsion of multiple sand grains at the impact site into the wind stream.  If the wind remains constant at or above u*ft, the flux of saltating grains q will initially increase exponentially as more and more grains are impacted and driven into the wind stream.  Since each additional saltating grain draws more momentum from the wind, the wind speed in the saltation layer decreases.  Eventually, the system reaches an equilibrium airborne grain density, where the force of the wind lifts as many grains as it possibly can into saltation.\\n\\nIn addition to increasing the number of grains in saltation, impacting grains also serve to initiate another type of sand movement, known as surface creep.  Even though grains that are a bit too large to saltate by direct wind pressure can be dislodged by impacting grains, other grains are too large to become airborne even when given this extra boost of momentum.  However, if these grains are not too large, they may be knocked forward along the sand surface without ever becoming airborne.  This is the process of surface creep:  descending grains impact other larger grains, moving them forward slightly before friction stops them.\\n\\nOnce saltation has been initiated, the main producer of saltating particles is the impact of other saltating particles on the sand bed.  A peculiar consequence of this property is that after the initiation of saltation, the shear velocity may drop below u*ft, and saltation will still continue.  At this point, the fluid threshold shear velocity becomes unimportant, and a new, lower threshold comes to light.  It is only when the shear velocity drops below this new level, the impact threshold shear velocity (u*t), that saltation will cease.\\n\\nThe aforementioned saturation of the boundary layer is not an instantaneous process.  For any given grain distribution and wind speed, there is a lag between the time saltation is initiated and when the maximum grain density is reached.  The saturation length is the distance a parcel of fluid moves before achieving the maximum grain density (Bagnold, 1941).  It also represents a rough measure of the distance it takes for a change in one property of the wind flow to reform into a new velocity profile according to Equation 1.\\n\\nSand movement, taken on the level of individual grains, is understandably chaotic.  A single wind-blown grain impacting the surface can knock multiple grains into random trajectories.  However, taking the average paths of individual saltating grains gives the characteristic path for a given sand and wind.  The length of this path is the saltation length, Ls, an important parameter in many sand transport models, as well as in the formation of ripples, which will be described later (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\nThe velocity distribution of the wind in the boundary layer is roughly logarithmic by height, as can be seen in Equation 1.  However, the level at which the velocity actually drops to zero is slightly above the actual ground level.  In fact, for different values of shear velocity over the same surface, the wind speed drops to zero at the same height.  This term, z0, is known as the surface roughness, which will be explained later.  It changes greatly between different types of terrain, and is dependant mainly on the degree of sand movement and dominant grain size.\\n\\n==Physics of sand movement==\\nSand, a granular material, has some properties of a fluid, some properties of a solid, and some of neither.  As such, it requires unique equations to describe its behavior, particularly when under the influence of a flowing fluid.\\n\\nSome of the first equations to accurately predict the movement of sand and sand formations were formulated by Ralph A. Bagnold.  His book, Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes, was the first comprehensive study on all forms of sand transport.  It is still used actively many decades later, and may still be the best work on the physics of sand dunes.  Many of his original equations will be useful in this analysis.\\nWithin the planetary boundary layer, mean wind velocity u varies logarithmically with height z according to the relation shown here\\n\\n	 	1\\n\\nwhere κ = 0.40 is the von Kármán constant (AMS, 2000), u* is the wind shear velocity, and z0 is the surface roughness. The terms u∗ and z0 are independent variables which may be determined experimentally.  The von Kármán constant does not depend on atmospheric properties; it is an experimentally derived universal constant.  It should be noted that z0 is not an actual measure of surface roughness, but an apparent measure, which will be explained later.\\n\\nWith the wind velocity distribution known, it is natural to investigate what strength of wind is needed to initiate sand movement.  Individual sand grains are rough, irregular chunks of material, varying widely from the theoretical spherical shape.  Therefore, as Bagnold pointed out, it is convenient to find a scaling factor for determining the diameter of a sphere of equivalent composition as the non-spherical sand grains which will behave identically under the influence of a fluid.  This shape factor is dependant largely upon the amount of weathering that the sand has undergone, as well as the average grading of the sand.  It must often be determined experimentally; for desert sand on Earth, 0.75 is a good approximation. (Bagnold, 1941)  Multiplying the actual average diameter of sand grains by the shape factor yields the apparent grain diameter, which will be used from here on in place of the actual grain diameter.\\n\\nThere are actually two forces imparted upon an exposed sand grain by the wind. (Parteli, 2007)  The first, a drag force, is due to the friction of the moving air on the grain, and is in the direction of the fluid flow.  It is described by the equation\\n\\n	 	2\\n\\nwhere d is the diameter of the particle, σ is its density, β is a constant which depends on the packing of the grains, and u* is the shear velocity.  The second force, the lift force, is\\n\\n	 	3\\n\\nwhere Δp is the difference in pressure from the bottom to the top of the grain.  On the scale of sand grains, due to the strong velocity gradient near the surface, the lift force is very significant.  On Earth, it is approximately equal to 85% of the magnitude of the drag force. \\n\\nAt the initiation of sand movement, the drag and lift forces work to rotate the grain over some pivot point p.  These forces are resisted by the grain’s weight, which is \\n\\n	 	4\\n\\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid and g is the planetary gravitational constant.  Thus, with a momentum balance, it is easily possible to find the threshold parameters for grain movement.  \\n\\nThe forces balance over a pivot point p seen on the right.  Therefore, when (5) is true, \\n\\n	 	5\\n\\nthe saltation process begins (Parteli, 2007).\\n\\nThere are several important parameters which govern sand movement, as well as two important thresholds which indicate when movement will begin.  Under unchanging topographic conditions, the shear velocity is defined by another important quantity, the shear stress, τf according to the relation\\n\\n	           	6\\n\\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid.  The shear stress is merely a measure of the drag force per unit surface area.\\nAs the shear velocity increases, the drag force and lift force increase as well.  The value of u* where the inequality shown in (5) is true is called the fluid threshold shear velocity (u*ft).  An equation for u*ft is \\n\\n	 	7\\n\\nwhere A is the Shields parameter.  The Shields parameter has been determined experimentally in the past, and is relatively constant on Earth.  Under low atmospheric pressure, however, the Shields parameter has a complex dependence upon the grain diameter and wind velocity.\\n\\nAt the fluid threshold, the most exposed sand grains begin to be entrained in the fluid.  Because the velocity of the wind works parallel to the surface, the motion of the grain is temporary; soon, any upward motion of the grain is checked by the grain’s weight, and the grain impacts the sand bed some distance downstream (Bagnold, 1941).\\nAs mentioned above, the additional momentum imparted to grains on impact allows grains of larger sizes to enter saltation.  Thus after the initiation of saltation the impact threshold shear velocity (u*t) becomes the more important parameter.  It is typically near 80% of the value of u*ft (Parteli, 2007).  \\n\\nIf dune movement is indeed occurring, then an important factor to know is the sand flux q, or the weight of sand transported per second.  Here is where Bagnold’s work becomes insufficient, as his sand flux equations are fairly accurate, but do not predict the existence of a threshold velocity.  A universal sand flux equation, which has been confirmed by both wind tunnel and field experiments, here shown as Equation 8 (White, 1979; Lancaster, 1995).\\n\\n	 	8\\n\\nThe problem, then, for determining the existence of dune movement on Mars through calculation, lies in the knowledge of several key features of the local Martian surface.  Indeed, it is very possible that there are places on Mars where saltation still occurs, and others where aeolian features are “petrified”, no longer influenced by the prevailing winds.\\n\\n==Dune formation and movement==\\n\\n===Small-scale sandforms===\\nSand under the influence of wind can be found in many different formations, dependant upon many factors, including grain size, average shear velocity, sand availability, and the presence of obstacles.  Sandform is a generic term for any sandy deposit or formation.\\n\\nThe simplest sandform is one found in the wake of an immobile object, such as an exposed rock, known as a sand shadow (Bagnold, 1941).  Sand shadows are formed by deposition of sand in saltation due to localized reduction of shear velocity in the wind shadow of such an immobile object.  \\n\\nBehind any object within a fluid flow, there is a surface of discontinuity, outside of which the flow is roughly laminar near the mean wind speed, but inside of which is turbulent, with a mean velocity lower than the mean wind speed.  The reason that sand, not dust, is deposited in these areas is a direct consequence of the definition of sand we are using here.  While sand is highly influenced by the wind, it will tend to follow a uniform trajectory rather than a changing streamline in the wind.  So a grain flying over or around an object while in saltation may, by chance, fall into the wind shadow behind the object, where it will likely stay.  A dust grain in suspension, however, will tend to follow the changing streamlines and fly past the wind shadow.\\n\\nIn addition to sand deposits found in the wake, any obstacle will also have a small pile in front of it, due to yet another wind shadow in front.\\n \\nFigure 3: Wind flow around a surface object.  Sand will tend to accumulate in the wind shadow, where the wind is turbulent with a lower average speed\\n\\nA related sand formation is a sand drift, which forms in gaps between objects and in wind shadows caused by changes in terrain.  \\n\\nSand shadows and drifts require the presence of obstacles to alter the boundary layer fluid flow.  However, one of the most interesting properties of sand is that a flat sand sheet is unstable under a fluid flow.  The mechanism for this peculiar property becomes apparent when you analyze the case of saltation over a flat sheet of sand.  \\nTake the simplifying case of a flat sheet of sand undergoing a uniform barrage of saltating grains.  In addition to there being a characteristic path to describe the average path of saltating grains, it turns out that all grains descend at a very uniform angle of descent.  Because of this, the descending grains can be represented by parallel vectors, as in Figure 4.  \\n\\nA “flat” sand sheet can not be perfectly flat, as it consists of finite grains of roughly circular proportions.  As such, at any moment there exists a multitude of minuscule pits and discontinuities.  Figure 4 shows just such a deformation, where a small depression has formed momentarily due to a few saltating grains being removed.  Because of the near-uniform descent angle of grains in saltation, the existence of the depression causes more sand grains to impact in the downwind slope of the crater than the upwind slope.\\n\\nThe sand flux due to surface creep, qc, is proportional to the number of impacts per surface area.  Therefore, the downwind side of the temporary depression is suddenly subjected to a much higher sand flux.  Since there are now more grains moving out of the depression than into it, a continuous saltation will serve to deepen the depression and extend it downwind.\\n\\nWhen the sand surface begins to deviate from the ideal flat sand sheet case, the ideal situation seen in Figure 4 with an even distribution of descending grains at a constant angle no longer applies.  Knowing that saltating grains have a characteristic path, a grain leaving the sand bed at some point will tend to land very near to a point one saltation length downwind.  Therefore, if an area has a much higher sand flux due to increased saltation impacts, the same will apply for an area one saltation length downwind.  In this way, a single chance depression will soon become an extended area of sand ripples.  These sand ripples have a very regular wavelength which is dependent upon the prevailing wind speed, and is remains constant over time as long as the wind speed remains constant.\\n\\nThe shape and height of these ripples depends on the surface sand grading, or the distribution of sand grain size.  This can be deduced by a simple analysis of growing ripples:  as the height of each ripple increases, the average velocity at the grains will increase according to the boundary-layer wind distribution (Equation 1).  If the range of grain sizes in a particular sand bed is small, the higher wind speed at the top of ripples will tend to topple the grains at the crest into the next trough.  Therefore a narrower range of grain sizes will result in smaller ripples.  A wider range of grain sizes will allow for larger ripples.\\n\\nAs seen previously, an area of increased grain impacts will also see an increase in the grains moved by surface creep.  Therefore, if a significant portion of the grains in the sand bed can only move by surface creep, a different kind of sand formation will be seen.  In this case, after the initiation of saltation, the smaller grains are slowly removed until the larger grains begin to dominate.  Ripple-like formations will still emerge, but they will have essential differences.  Larger grains only capable of surface creep will begin collecting at each crest, creating a wind shadow for the subsequent trough similar to that in Figure 4.  Since the larger grains are moved much slower than the smaller grains, and cannot move in their own shadow due to a lack of saltation, the collection at each crest grows larger, as shown in Figure 5.  These features are known as ridges.\\n\\nAt some point, assuming uniform conditions throughout the sand bed, the ridges will grow large enough to shelter the troughs completely, halting saltation, and creating a stable configuration of small, steep-faced ripples.  However, a more common case is one where there is an oncoming saltation from upstream.  In this scenario, the surface creep will continue to build the ridges higher.  With higher ridges, the wind shadows grow longer, and subsequently the wavelength increases.  If saltation conditions prevail for long periods, ridges can grow indefinitely.  So unlike ripples, the wavelength of ridges does not depend on the mean wind velocity.\\n \\nFigure 5:  A typical ridge.  The line AC represents the wind shadow where no saltation or surface creep is taking place, the line DA is the area of maximum surface creep, and the line AB is where creeping grains from the crest are avalanching down the downwind slope.  From Bagnold, 1941.\\n\\nThere is a third feature, known as a megaripple, which can form under the same conditions as normal ripples.  They are widely spaced, less regular in their repetition than normal ripples.  It is unknown whether their wavelengths are dependant upon grain distribution or properties of the local wind regime.  Little is known about their genesis or evolution, and many consider them to be dunes rather than ripples or ridges, but they have been widely observed on the surface of Mars. \\n\\nOne important feature distinguishes ripples and ridges from other sand forms.  In ripples and ridges, the coarsest grains appear at the crests, with finer grains in the troughs.  The opposite is true for so-called large-scale sand formations, the majority of which are true sand dunes.\\n\\n===Dune formation===\\nThe genesis of dunes has actually been observed only rarely in any detail (Lancaster 1995).  Only a few studies have documented properties of dunes from formation until maturity, and these only noted the physical transformation of the dune, not the sand properties believed to be important in dune genesis.  The accepted theory regarding dune formation comes mainly from the study of mature dunes and wind tunnel scenarios, so there is an inherent uncertainty in the exact processes which take place.\\n\\nContrary to popular belief, a sandy desert floor on Earth is rarely composed entirely of sand.  A typical desert floor is either composed of a sandy surface interspersed with pebbles and a few larger boulders, or what is known as a desert pavement, where all surface sand and dust have been removed, leaving a layer of interlocking pebbles.\\nThe desert pavement case is irrelevant for our purposes.  In other areas, large pebbles among smaller sand grains will tend to space themselves out evenly, regardless of their initial distribution.  Because of this, the presence of pebbles tends to stabilize a sand sheet, halting saltation by raising z0, the level at which average wind velocity drops to zero.  However, if a sand sheet stabilized by pebbles is subjected to a stronger wind, more sand may be removed, until another equilibrium level is reached where the sand grains are sheltered by the pebbles.\\n\\nA sandy area with large pebbles can sustain a much higher sand flux than a bare sand sheet.  This is due to the tendency of saltating grains to rebound higher and longer when impacting an immobile object such as a pebble.  So when a patch of bare sand forms by deposition or other processes, the tendency will be for upwind saltation to deposit sand on an existing sand patch.  However, a pebbly surface will have a much higher surface roughness than a surface of bare sand, and so the fluid threshold shear velocity will be much higher as well.  So if the shear velocity is not much higher than u*ft for the pebbly surface (a “gentle” wind), the sand patch will be stretched downwind and dispersed.\\n\\nIn the case of a shear velocity much higher than both fluid thresholds (around 4×u*ft, a “strong” wind), saltation will begin in earnest before the wind reaches the sand patch.  At the upwind edge of the sand patch, saltation increases violently, causing substantial drag which causes a reduction in the wind velocity at and just upwind of the bare sand patch, which in turn results in a net deposition of sand.  In this way, a strong wind will serve to increase the thickness of a sand patch, as well as extend it upwind. The same process has been shown to occur in areas where the surface roughness changes more gradually, due to a change in the sand grading.\\n\\nIn order for dunes to form in these areas of changing surface roughness, four conditions must be satisfied.  First, wind which causes saltation along the smoother sand surface must not blow for too long, lest it dissipate the sand accumulation entirely.  Second, for the duration that the strong wind blows, there must be a consistent supply of sand from upstream, or else the smoother sand patch will quickly dissipate in much the same manner.  Third, there must not be a large amount of grains in surface creep, as these grains will tend to encroach upon the smoother patch of sand, preventing dune growth.  Fourth and lastly, the smoother sand must be at least as long as the saturation length, as there will be varying instances of removal and deposition as the new wind profile adjusts.  This saturation length, usually between 4 and 6 meters on earth, represents a lower limit for the size of true sand dunes.\\n\\nThere are two mechanisms by which upwind saltation could be sustained.  The first case we will consider is a unidirectional wind profile, where both strong and gentle winds blow in the same direction (±15º) (Lancaster, 1995).\\nIn a unidirectional wind regime, any sand patches will have no mechanism by which to become wider, and may only extend in the downwind direction.  This leads to the appearance of sand strips, which are arranged parallel to the prevailing wind.  Unless the wind is much higher than the sand’s threshold shear velocity, these sand strips will soon thin out to the point where buried pebbles start to reemerge, in addition to encroaching grains in surface creep.  However, if a period of strong winds occurs, an interesting self-sustaining wind regime may form close to the surface.  The intense saltation ongoing over the sand strips saturates the boundary layer, slowing the near-surface wind velocity significantly.  \\n\\nThe intervening areas between strips are pebbly, and under a gentle wind the higher surface roughness dictates that the near-surface wind velocity will be lower than over the sand strip.  This situation changes in the above case of a very strong wind.  While there may or may not be saltation over the pebbly surface, the density of saltating grains will be less, assuming the wind is not so strong that this area is saturated as well.  This creates alternating streams of slower and faster wind, which tends to create small eddies and vortices, the sum of which is a convergent wind pattern on the sand strips.  This process can be seen in Figure 7.  If the strong wind can be sustained for a long enough time, these sand strips may eventually build into longitudinal dunes, which are arranged parallel to the wind flow.\\n\\nThe second case, where gentle winds blow in a different direction than the stronger winds, is much simpler.  If an isolated sand patch is created, a strong wind will build it up, at the expense of a now-denuded area just downwind.  If gentle winds occur, just barely above the saltation threshold, from a different direction, they will thin out the accumulated pile slightly, but also replenish the denuded area with a fresh layer of sand.  This regime tends to create oblique dunes or transverse dunes, depending on the magnitude of the direction difference.  Oblique dunes are arranged at an angle to the direction of dune propagation, while transverse dunes are perpendicular to the direction of dune propagation.  Regardless of which case occurs, a continuation of strong winds will build a budding dune steadily up to a certain point.  However, when the dune reaches a size where it begins to alter the nearby wind profile, it no longer needs a strong wind to sustain it.  \\n\\nWhen a dune first forms, a cross-section taken parallel to the dune-building wind typically takes a shape similar to the one shown in Figure 8.  Because of the projection of the dune up into the wind stream, the dune significantly alters the wind profile.  Closer streamlines on the upwind or stoss side of the dune show areas of higher wind velocity, indicative of a net positive sand flux, or sand removal.  On the downwind or lee side of the dune, the streamlines spread apart, showing an area of net negative sand flux, or sand deposition.  In this way, a dune can move essentially unaltered across a desert floor, even if the wind is only strong enough to move the bare sand on the dune.\\n \\nFigure 8:  New dune altering the wind profile above itself.  The streamlines appear closer together on the stoss side of the developing dune, and further apart on the lee side, so sand is removed from the front of the dune and deposited downwind, causing dune movement.\\n\\nA sand dune can not remain in this uniform, hill-like profile for long.  Equation 9 gives the sand flux on a simple hill-shaped dune undergoing no net flux (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\n	 	9\\n\\nwhere x is the horizontal distance from the upwind foot of the dune, c is the velocity of the dune, ρs is the density of the sand in bulk (including air between grains), and α is the inclination of the dune surface at point x.  Therefore, all other factors being equal, the both the net removal and deposition of sand will occur at the point where the slope is the steepest, shown in Figure 8.  With an unequal sand flux, different areas of the dune will begin to advance at different rates, leading to an oversteepening of the lee slope as seen in Figure 9.\\n\\nWhen sand is piled on itself, like any granular material, it can only support itself against the force of gravity to a certain point.  Because of frictional and inter-grain cohesive forces, a sand pile can achieve a fairly large angle, typically around 34º for sand on Earth.  Any slope steeper than this angle will collapse, avalanching until the slope below this critical angle, known as the angle of repose.  In the case of a moving dune, sand avalanching in this manner will eventually morph the lee slope into a fairly straight slope just shallower than the angle of repose.  This straight slope is known as a slip face, and is always roughly transverse to the direction of winds above the saltation threshold.\\n\\nWith the formation of the slip face, the lee of the dune now contains a wind shadow, with a surface of discontinuity roughly equal to the surface of the ideal “sand hill” shown in Figure 8.  The wind shadow will serve to increase deposition even further at the foot of the dune, causing dunes with slip faces to continue to grow.  The dune has now reached maturity, and will continue to evolve and migrate as long as there is a consistent wind above the saltation threshold.  \\n\\n===Dune types===\\nThe exact evolution of the dune beyond its initial formation depends upon two factors:  the amount of sand available for saltation outside of the dune, and the wind regime complexity.  The previous descriptions of dunes as, longitudinal, oblique, or transverse refers only to the arrangement of individual dunes in a group in reference to the prevailing wind regime.  These terms have little or no bearing on the actual dune type.  There are three major types of dunes, each of which represents different local conditions, and, most importantly, all of which are found on Mars (Lancaster, 1995).\\n\\nThe first dune type, arguably the easiest to recognize, is the barchan dune.  Barchans form in areas of limited sand availability and unidirectional wind regimes.  The stoss side of the dune is relatively featureless and dome-shaped.  The slip face is curved, resembling a bite which has been taken out of a dome-shaped dune, terminating with two horns extending downwind, one on each side of the dune.\\n\\nNow, the curved slip face is not an indication of changing wind directions.  It is a consequence of the change in sand-wind interaction as the dune grows.  A larger dune begins to interrupt the linear fluid flow, causing it to curve slightly around both sides of the dune.  Since the local wind speed is the most important factor in determining the slip-face orientation, this slight curvature of the horizontal wind profile causes the slip-face to become curved (Bagnold, 1941).\\n\\nFigure 10 shows a very neat example of a Martian barchan dune.  This dune exists near 41.4°S 44.6°E, on the western rim of Hellas Basin, the largest impact crater on Mars, and is part of a chain of barchans not seen to the lower left and upper right.  In this image, by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE imager, all the classic barchan features are visible.  The curved, crescent-shaped slip face is prominently featured in the center, dissipating into two “horns” downwind.  The remainder of the dome-shaped dune is covered in sand ripples, which tend to form on barchans due to their unidirectional wind environment.  The dune-forming wind is from ENE-to-WSW, and the ground outside of the dune is a jumbled bedrock terrain, distributed with small sand deposits, suggesting very limited sand availability.  The dune is about 120 m long from stoss foot to horn tip, with the horn-to-horn distance of about 40 m, fairly typical of large barchans found on Earth.\\n\\nThe barchan is one type of the larger group of crescentic dunes, all of which are formed under unidirectional wind regimes.  Another type of crescentic dunes is very closely related, crescentic ridges (not actual ridges, but a type of dune).  Crescentic ridges resemble parallel chains of barchan dunes which tend to overlap.  Logically, crescentic ridges form in areas where sand availability is higher than with pure barchans, but the wind regime is still unidirectional (Lancaster, 1995).  \\n\\nOn earth, the most common type of dune is the linear dune.  However, on Mars, linear dunes only appear to be dominant in about 5% of large dune fields (Hayward et al., 2007).  Linear dunes appear when there are two dominant sand-moving directions, separated by more than 15º. (Lancaster, 1995)  The slip face is not fixed with respect to a linear dune, but shifts from one side of the crest to the other as the wind regime changes.  A related dune type which has also been found on Mars is the reversing dune, which is formed by a wind regime which periodically changes direction close to 180º.\\n\\nAn even more complicated wind regime, featuring three or more prominent wind directions, results in the formation of star dunes.  These can be the largest dunes, building to several hundred meters high on Earth.  These dunes have multiple slip faces, which are active and inactive depending on the current direction of the wind.  On Mars, they are often found on the floor of smaller craters such as Victoria Crater.\\n\\n==Expected nature of sand-surface interaction on Mars==\\n\\n===Martian weather and climate===\\nMars has long been theorized to have an active atmosphere, possessing many of the familiar transient atmospheric characteristics which we on Earth call “weather”.  As early as 1877, Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli observed what he thought were “clouds” in the Martian sky (Parteli, 2007).  While it is almost certain that what he observed were dust storms which cover the surface of Mars every year or so, it began the race to determine just how “alive” the Martian atmosphere currently is.\\n\\nMariner 9 offered the first up-close look at the planet and its atmosphere in 1971.  Imagery at Mariner 9’s arrival indicated that Mars was in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm, obscuring the surface to the point that the striking polar ice caps were not even visible (Parteli, 2007).\\n\\nAfter a few weeks, the dust storm cleared, allowing for the first clear, high-resolution images of the Martian surface.  These images clearly showed large expanses of dune fields on all corners of the planet.  This spurred theories of an active atmosphere with ongoing sand movement.\\n\\nFive years later, the Viking landers reached the surface of Mars, taking the first direct measurements of wind speed in an extraterrestrial environment.  They measured a mean wind speed which rarely exceeded 10 m/s, which corresponds to a wind shear velocity of approximately 0.8 m/s, assuming several theoretical values are correct (Moore, 1985).  These wind measurements were only taken at one height (1.6 m), so the typical wind profile on Mars could still only be estimated.\\n\\nThere were several significant dust storms during the Viking missions, each of which was associated with a peak in wind speeds to 20 m/s or more.  In at least one case, the wind reached 40-50 m/s (wind shear velocity 3-4 m/s) for a period of around 40 seconds at the Viking 1 lander, causing the first observed saltation event on Mars.\\n\\nThe Pathfinder rover, Sojourner, contained instruments to gather this missing data.  The Pathfinder landing site (19.33 N, 33.55 W) was not far from the Viking 1 site (22.697° N latitude and 48.222° W longitude), and in an area of similar surface composition (Sullivan, 2002).  Sojourner  featured a meteorological boom with three wind socks, which was to help fill in the missing data.  Unfortunately for the meteorological goals of the mission (although probably fortunately for the mission in general), the weather was calm for the entire 83 Martian-day mission, with the wind never climbing above 10 m/s at the 1 meter elevation, and no observed sand or dust movement (Sullivan et al., 2000; Sullivan 2002).  There was enough data to estimate a fluid threshold shear velocity of 4.5 m/s, much higher than the numerically and experimentally predicted value of 2.0-2.5 m/s, likely due to the abundance of boulders and large rocks (Sullivan, 2002).\\n\\nThus it is expected that the average weather on Mars is relatively calm.  However, during dust storms, it appears that winds above the saltation threshold can occur, and have occurred in the past.  These planet-wide dust storms occur almost every year in the Martian northern-hemisphere autumn, and likely happen with such repetition because the atmospheric pressure is highest at that time (Larsen et al., 2002).\\n\\nTemperature at the surface has only a minor influence on saltation, aside from possibly preventing it in the case where water or CO2 frost accumulates.  Temperature has been found to vary widely with season, latitude, and time of day, just as on Earth, but typically is in the range of 180-260 K (-135ºF to 10ºF) in the summer and 160-200 K (-170ºF to -100ºF) in the winter.\\n\\n===Global distribution of sand dunes and sheets on Mars===\\nAlthough aeolian processes are ubiquitous on Mars, large-scale sand sheets/seas, dune fields and ergs are not as extensive on Mars as on Earth.  A recent estimate of the coverage of large-scale sand features (dune fields and sand sheets) on Mars is on the order of 800,000 km2, or about 1% of the Martian surface surveyed in that study (Hayward et al., 2007).  On Earth, large-scale sand features cover approximately 5,000,000 km2, and while this is 1.0% of the Earth’s total surface area, it is 3.4% of Earth’s land area.\\n\\nOn Mars, dunes are found almost exclusively within craters and Valles Marineris, the 4000 km-long canyon system near the planet’s equator.  While on Earth most dunes are linear in nature, on Mars a vast majority of dunes are crescentic, with a smaller amount being linear (Hayward et al., 2007).  Large dune fields feature very few star dunes; however, smaller dune fields in medium-sized craters almost universally have a star-like appearance.\\n\\nAs aeolian processes seem to be the only active geological processes on Mars, aside from impact craters and very localized water action, the lower concentration of dunes compared to Earth suggests that there is less sand available for saltation, either because winds above the saltation threshold are less prevalent or there is less total sand on Mars.  Indeed, it may be a combination of the two.  The main source of erosion which produces sand-sized particles on Earth is oceans and other hydrological processes; these are obviously absent from present-day Mars.  On top of that, evidence for present-day winds above the saltation threshold is very sparse.  Prior to the landing of the Mars Exploration Rovers, there has only been one verified instance of indirectly observed saltation on Mars, during the (Viking 1) Martian Dust Storm of Sol 1742 (Moore, 1985).\\n\\n===Properties of the surface and atmosphere at Meridiani Planum===\\nWhile the initial scope of this study was a planet-wide search for dune movement, eventually the search for directly-observed movement of sand moved to Meridiani Planum, in the area around Victoria Crater, where Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has been aggressively imaging the landscape.  \\n\\nWind data is sparse for the Martian surface.  Only three landers have succeeded in making wind measurements, and only the two Viking landers have a data set more than a few months long.  However, these data sets agreed that the shear velocity rarely exceeds 1.0 m/s, and only dust storms contain winds strong enough to produce saltation. This is much lower than u*ft, which is estimated to be approximately 2.0 m/s at Meridiani Planum (Sullivan et al., 2005).\\nFor the area of Meridiani Planum, as with most of the surface of Mars, the sand is composed of basaltic sandstone.   The grains are approximately 50-150µm in diameter, topped by a scattering of pebbles as large as a few millimeters.  The density of grains has been estimated as approximately 3200 kg/m3 (Sullivan et al., 2005).\\n\\nLike Earth, the wind is rarely dead calm on Mars.  This is apparent from wind speed measurements by both Viking landers and Sojourner rover, which were typically less than 10 m/s (22 mph), but were rarely dead calm.  At Meridiani Planum, prevailing winds during apparently calm weather gradually removed dust from Opportunity’s solar panels over a period of 50 Martian days in the summer of 2006.\\n\\n===Expectations for sand dune movement on Mars===\\nMany studies have attempted to find conclusive evidence of sand movement on Mars.  It is apparent that dunes are either migrating very slowly now, or have migrated in the recent past.  There are two main bodies of evidence which support this:  first, there are very few known impact craters on dunes, and second, most Martian dunes appear crisp, with well-defined slip faces.  Studies have estimated that, if sand movement does occur, it is at a rate of 1-8 cm per year at most (Fenton, 2006).\\n\\nDune fields at Rabe Crater (44 ºS, 35ºE) and Proctor Crater (48ºS, 30ºE) have shown strong evidence for dune movement.  Images of Rabe Crater dunes show alternating dark and light streaks on the dunes’ slip faces which change even over the course of a single Martian year, which have been interpreted as saltation-induced grainflows (Fenton, 2006).  Images of Proctor Crater dunes indicate possible slip face reversing on barchanoid dunes (Fenton et al., 2005).  There is even a suggestion in this study that one slip face moved as much as 37 m, however, no study has yet succeeded in directly imaging a large-scale change in dune positions, which would confirm dune migration.\\n\\n==Observation techniques==\\n\\n===History of early observations of Mars===\\nMars is a prominent visible feature in the night sky.  At its closest approach to Earth, it is the 4th brightest object in the night sky, and one of the only visible objects to be bright red.  As such, it has been observed since man first gazed upward, and was recorded by many ancient civilizations as a star signifying war or death.  Until the 17th century, however, it was merely a mote of red light, varying in brightness over the period of a few years.\\n\\nThe first observations of recognizable features on the planet’s surface are attributable to Christiaan Huygens, who sketched a dark plain now known as Syrtis Major, as well as the bright southern polar ice cap, in 1672.  In the same year, Giovanni Domenico Cassini observed a transit of a small star by Mars, and concluded that it must have a very thick atmosphere; although it turned out that his observations were flawed, this was the first “evidence” of a dynamic Martian atmosphere.  In the early 18th century, Giacomo Filippo Maraldi drew what he thought were clouds stretched across the planet, though these turned out to be permanent features of the planets surface which are still visible today.  He also described changes he observed in the southern ice cap, and suggested that the properties of the surface there changed somehow from year to year (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nIn 1783, William Herschel observed another Martian transit and concluded that Cassini’s observations of a very thick Martian atmosphere were false.  However, he also observed what he called “occasional changes of partial bright belts”, concluding they were storm clouds above the planet.  As the few clouds known to exist on Mars are not visible even today from Earth, Herschel likely was observing local dust storms.  In the 1820s and 1830s, Johann Heinrich Mädler and Wilhelm Beer made many contributions to the study of Mars, conclusively proving that the previously observed dark patches were permanent surface features, and determining the planet’s rotational period to within a few seconds.  In 1837 they observed that Mars was nearly featureless save the ice caps, possibly indicating the first observation of a planet-wide dust storm.  In 1864, Rev. William Rutter Dawes improved greatly upon Mädler and Beer’s observations, making drawings depicting almost every major albedo feature identified today (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nAt this point, there was little more that could be learned from earth-bound telescopes, given the limitations imposed by atmospheric aberrations.  In fact, further refinement of observations, more often than not, were completely wrong.  In the 1870’s, Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli first made the infamous claims of canali, Italian for “canals” or “channels”, on the surface of Mars.  As it turned out, the “channels” were either illusions due to optical effects, or simply imagined features (Sheehan, 1996).  Until the 1960s, the prominent theory was that the dark albedo features on Mars were swaths of vegetation, and the ice caps were seasonal patches of water-ice (Sheehan, 1996).  There were observations of yellow clouds, thought to be dust storms, and white clouds, thought to be analogous to earthbound clouds.  There was even a scientific consensus that many dark features were blue in color (Sagan and Kellogg 1963).\\n\\nHowever, there were some doubters to the scientific consensus.  Some theorized a desert-like planet with large dune fields and no vegetation.  As early as the 1950s the idea of a Martian surface dominated by sand dunes was proposed (Gifford, 1964).  A few scientists also doubted the existence of the canali as anything more than mere optical illusions.\\n\\n===Observations from Martian probes===\\nThose doubters were proven right by the observations of Mariner 4 in 1965.  Sending spacecraft to Mars was no small task—several probes launched by both Russia and the United States failed to reach Mars successfully in early 1963 and mid-1965.  Mariner 4 performed the first successful fly-by of Mars in July, 1965.  It was only able to take 22 discontinuous, low-resolution, blurry images, but they were sufficient to reveal that the traditional view of Mars’s atmosphere was quite wrong.  The images taken by the television camera revealed an old, dry, cratered surface, with no canals, no vegetation, and no evidence of life whatsoever.  Indeed, it looked closer in appearance to the moon than to Earth.  To further disprove the contemporary theories, atmospheric measurements indicated that the surface pressure was at most a few millibars, and was composed almost entirely of carbon dioxide (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nIt was at this time that the idea of dust storms as the main form of weather on the planet first rose to prominence.  It was the only plausible explanation for the seasonal changes in albedo features, with the idea of liquid water and vegetation now all but debunked.  The images were not nearly detailed enough to image sand dunes, however, it was widely believed that the atmospheric dust was lifted by surface sand movement and saltation impacts (Goody, 1969).\\n\\nThe next probes sent to Mars, Mariner 6 and Mariner 7, would add detail to the planets surface (high-resolution imagery of about 10% of the planet’s surface), and confirm the atmospheric measurements made by Mariner 4.  By chance, they photographed no dust storms or dune fields, especially because only a few dozen images from these two probes were of high enough resolution.  However, they did capture images of frost in craters, as well as confirm that the ice caps were likely CO2 ice (Sheehan, 1996).\\n\\nThe next successful mission, Mariner 9, was also the first successful Mars orbiter.  In fall of 1971, it began returning images of a planet completely devoid of surface features.  After shutting down for a month to conserve power, it began returning images rich in detail, including craters, valleys, and, most importantly, sand dunes.  Mariner 9 was able to image most of the surface down to a resolution of 100 meters or so.  \\n\\nSince then, the resolution of images sent back from Mars has steadily improved.  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Viking orbiters imaged much of the planet down to a resolution of 40-90 meters, with many areas of interest imaged as well as 10-meter resolution.  The next Mars orbiter, the Mars Global Surveyor, arrived almost 20 years later in 1997.  It’s Mars Orbiter Camera imaged about 70% of the planet to better than 7-meter resolution in almost 10 years orbiting Mars.  Finally, the current Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera is imaging areas of interest with a resolution of 25-50 centimeters.\\n\\n11.	References\\n*Alghamdi, A. A. A. and Akyurt, M.

\\n<big>DATA BSE</big>\\n                       A database is an organized collection of data for one or more purposes, usually in digital form. The data are typically organized to model relevant aspects of reality (for example, the availability of rooms in hotels), in a way that supports processes requiring this information (for example, finding a hotel with vacancies). This definition is very general, and is independent of the technology used.\\nThe term "database" may be narrowed to specify particular aspects of organized collection of data and may refer to the logical database, to physical database as data content incomputer data storage or to many other database sub-definitions.\\nThe term database is correctly applied to the data and their supporting data structures, and not to the database management system (referred to by the acronym DBMS). The database data collection with DBMS is called a database system.\\nThe term database system implies that the data is managed to some level of quality (measured in terms of accuracy, availability, usability, and resilience) and this in turn often implies the use of a general-purpose database management system (DBMS).[1] A general-purpose DBMS is typically a complex software system that meets many usage requirements, and the databases that it maintains are often large and complex. The utilization of databases is now spread to such a wide degree that virtually every technology and product relies on databases and DBMSs for its development and commercialization, or even may have such embedded in it. Also, organizations and companies, from small to large, heavily depend on databases for their operations.
The Mumbai terrorist attacks struck India's tourism industry but it will be resilient and bounce back as it did post-September 2001. The present crisis presents an opportunity. There was an even bigger crisis in Indian tourism in 2001-02. The attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, war in Afghanistan, withdrawal of flights, attack on Parliament House in New Delhi and troop mobilisation on the India-Pakistan border meant that Indian hotels had just 20-25 per cent occupancy. International tour operators had removed India from their sale brochures and inbound Indian tour operators had switched to outbound operations.

As outsourcing of Logistics / SCM operations become more popular for firms, the management of risk will gain more importance. Variables such as fluctuating exchange rates, supply disruptions due to labor strikes and supplier bankruptcy may cause havoc on the supply chain. Implementing a solid risk management strategy will help reduce uncertainties.
I am a neurologist and ALS Researcher. One of the reasons I have become involved with Wikipedia is that my patients often come to me with articles downloaded from the Internet – often well sourced from Wikipedia! This is one of the fantastic ways that medicine has moved on from the bad old days of paternalism – now patients (or clients) are up to date, want to know more and are keen to become involved in research. \\n\\nBut some information out there (all over the Internet) is misleading, misrepresentative and gives false hope to terminally ill patients.... and even worse, sometimes a vulnerable section of people are exploited.  \\n\\nMy hope is to see that the neurology research on Wikipedia continues to be well-written, peer-reviewed and a reliable source of information for those who need it most.

'''<big>BLAST INJURIES</big>'''\\n\\n\\n'''WHY ARE BLAST INJURIES AN IMPORTANT ISSUE RIGHT NOW?'''\\n\\nAmerica's armed forces are sustaining attacks from explosions or blast by rocket-propelled grenades, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and land mines almost daily in deployed settings. Civilian workers and military personnel working in these combat zones are at increased risk of blast-related trauma, particularly blast-related traumatic brain injury (TBI). \\n\\nSome of the TBI and concussive injuries associated with significant blast may not be identified acutely for several reasons. Initially, the blast-related TBI or concussion may have occur simultaneously with other more obvious life threatening injuries. Initially, the focus of medical care providers must be on the most life threatening injuries. Sometimes, in the case of a concussion/mild TBI (mTBI) resulting from blast, there may be no outward sign of injury; service members may also be reluctant to endorse acute symptoms because they do not want to be medically evacuated and separated from their unit. Because blast exposure is so common in the combat zones and almost everyone has had some of the acute symptoms of concussion, it may not be identified as problematic until the service member returns home from the deployment. \\n\\nFinally, concussions and TBI related to significant blast exposure are also likely to have other important co-morbid conditions present. For example, the patient may also have combat stress or depression associated with a return from deployment; it is very challenging for the medical providers in these situations to determine what symptoms are due to the concussion and which symptoms are due to the combat stress or depression. \\n\\n'''HOW DOES BLAST EXPOSURE CAUSE A CONCUSSION OR A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY?'''\\n\\nA TBI is caused by a blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the function of the brain. Exposure to blast events can affect the body in a number of ways; in addition, these different injuries mechanisms can interact and result in more impairments or prolonged periods of recovery.\\nPrimary blast injury is the result of exposure to the over pressurization wave or the complex pressure wave that is generated by the blast itself. This blast over-pressurization wave travels at a high velocity and is affected by the surrounding environment; for example, the effects of the blast wave may be increased in a closed environment such as a vehicle. Air-filled organs such as the ear, lung, and gastrointestinal tract and organs surrounded by fluid-filled cavities such as the brain and spinal cord are especially susceptible to primary blast injury (Elsayed, 1997; Mayorga, 1997). The over pressurization wave dissipates quickly, causing the greatest risk of injury to those closest to the explosion.\\nSecondary blast injury is the result of energized fragments flying through the air; these fragments may cause penetrating brain injury.\\nTertiary blast injury may occur when the individual is thrown from the blast into a solid object such as a adjacent wall or even a steering wheel. These types of injuries are associated with acceleration/ deceleration forces and blunt force trauma to the brain similar to that observed following high speed motor vehicle accidents.\\nFinally, quaternary blast injury can occur in the presence of severe blast related trauma resulting from significant blood loss associated with traumatic amputations or even from inhalation of toxic gases resulting from the explosion.\\nIn summary, TBI resulting from blast exposure can be much more complex compared to TBI from other causes. As such, it is challenging to differentiate blast related TBI and/or concussion from other conditions. Finally, it is also difficult to estimate the course of recovery in these cases, as it may vary widely depending on various types of blast injury and other injury variables, such as the size of the blast, distance from the blast, etc. Because of these issues, it may be difficult to assess blast related TBI and concussion in the same manner that other brain injuries are examined. A better approach may be to conduct an evaluation based on the mechanism (cause) of the injury; that is, screen all individual service members exposed to a blast for any symptoms which might be resulting from the effects of blast on the brain. \\n\\n'''WHAT SYMPTOMS MAY INDICATE A BLAST RELATED BRAIN INJURY?'''\\n\\nDifficulties experienced as a result of a closed brain blast injury may include a range of physical, emotional, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Many of these symptoms are non-specific, however; that is they occur with other conditions such as depression or combat stress. It requires an experience clinician who is familiar with the many variables involved in blast injury and has an understanding of how these variables can affect recovery and ultimately impact return to everyday activities.\\n\\n'''WHAT IS DVBIC DOING TO CARE FOR THOSE WITH BLAST INJURIES?'''\\n\\nDVBIC works to identify all service members who have sustained a closed brain injury during combat operations and to ensure that they receive the best care available. \\n\\nBecause the effects of blast injury on the brain are still being discovered, DVBIC has led the way in developing a number of important research projects examining specific variables involved in the blast. In addition, DVBIC has been involved in studies on developing combat gear which will better protect the brain should a blast occur. \\n\\nFinally, DVBIC has been involved in the validation of several important diagnostic tests for better identifying the blast effects on the brain; these include the use of advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as Diffuse Tensor-weighted Imaging (DTI) and advanced technologies for measuring the function of the brain as the individual works on specific tasks; this technique is known as Magnetoencephalography (MEG).\\n\\n<ref>{{cite web|title=BLAST INJURIES|url=http://www.dvbic.org/TBI---The-Military/Blast-Injuries.aspx|publisher=http://www.dvbic.org|accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref>

== J2ME ==\\n\\nJ2ME made its debut at the JavaOne Developers Conference in mid-1999 and is targeted\\nto developers of intelligent wireless devices and small computing devices who need to\\nincorporate cross-platform functionality in their products.\\nConsumers of mobile and small computing devices have high performance\\nexpectations for these devices. They demand quick response time, compatibility with\\ncompanion services, and full-featured applications in a small computing device.\\nConsumers expect the same software and capabilities found on their desktop and laptop\\ncomputers to be available on their cell phones and personal digital assistants.\\nTo meet these expectations, developers have to rethink the way they build computer\\nsystems. Developers need to harness the power of existing front-end and back-end\\nsoftware found on business computers and transfer this power onto small, mobile, and\\nwireless computing devices. J2ME enables this transformation to occur with minimal\\nmodifications, assuming that applications are scalable in design so that an application\\ncan be custom-fitted to resources available on a small computing device.\\nDevelopers seeking to build applications that run on cell phones, personal digital\\nassistants, and various consumer and industrial appliances must strike a balance between\\na thick client and a thin client. A thick client is front-end software that contains the logic\\nto handle a sizable amount of data processing for the system. A thin client is front-end software that depends on back-end software for much of the system processing.
'''Background'''\\n\\nNowadays, the problems of climate changing and global warming become more and more serious, numbers of countries have implemented carbon taxes or energy taxes that are related to carbon dioxide emission in order to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and thereby reduce the speed of global warming. In Europe, numbers countries, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Italy, Switzerland, and the UK have imposed energy taxes based on carbon content. More surprisingly, in the most powerful manufacturers’ country, China Daily (2010) stated that the Chinese government has proposed to introduce a carbon tax from 2012 or 2013. According to Australian government (2011), Australia is one of the top carbon dioxide emission countries which produce 500million tones of carbon pollution each year. \\nA carbon tax is also called as a price instrument, since it sets a price for carbon dioxide emissions. In economic aspect, the carbon dioxide pollution is considered as negative externality, a negative effect on a party not directly involved in a transaction, which results in a market failure. A tax on a negative externality is called a Pigovian tax which should be equal to marginal damage costs. \\nAustralian carbon tax is a tax on energy sources which charging based on the amount of emission level. It can be implemented by taxing the burning of fossil fuels. The carbon tax involved in producing a product would start to be factored into its final price. Moreover, Australia government plans to use the tax income to investing clean energy. In the future, the carbon tax will simulate the pollution-intensive companies to use other clean production processes in order to reduce their emission and lower their costs.\\n\\n'''Impact on mining'''\\n\\nWhile the Australian Government sees great benefit from the carbon tax, in the mining community, a very different view exists. Unsustainable increases in operating costs could lead to the closure of many mines and thus mass job losses, while businesses which rely on the mining of resources such as airlines could be forced to use cheaper alternatives, thus reducing the required output from these mines. \\nThe introduction of the tax would ‘hinder Australian mining’s ability to operate in the world market’ (Mineral council of Australia 2011). It is estimated that by 2020 the Australian mining industry will have paid between 18 - 25 billion dollars in tax, meaning that Australia’s industry will be at a disadvantage in the world market. This common concern amongst the Australian mining industry is highlighted by the fact that in Europe 73% of all mining exporters are subsidised by the government while only 16% would be in Australia under the carbon tax. The mining industry in Australia already has to compete with mining industries overseas, namely Indonesia, Columbia and China. These countries have significantly cheaper operating costs than Australia ($34 to lift one tone of coal opposed to $42 in Australia), mainly due to the substandard working conditions that exist in these countries. \\n\\nThe Australian Coal Association’s chairman, John Pegler, believes that 17% of all black coal mines in Australia will close putting ‘at risk more than 21000 jobs in the next ten years’ as a consequence of the carbon tax. The ‘economic deadweight cost’ (Marius Kloppers, BHP Billiton’s CEO 2011) will be too large for the smaller mining companies to absorb, forcing the closure of these mines. This ultimately could mean that a monopoly will begin to exist within the mining industry, with larger companies such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto becoming the only mining operators in Australia.\\n\\n'''Political impact'''\\n\\nThe carbon tax has received heavy criticism from opposing parties. One of the major criticisms of the proposed plan is that it will increase inflation. Treasury modelling suggests that household cost will increase by an average of $9.90 per week as a result of the tax. This is because polluters are expected to pass on the cost to consumers. The demand for services such as electricity is said to be relatively inelastic. This means that there aren’t any good substitutes for this service which in turn allows firms to increases prices freely. Therefore, the tax could essentially become politically unsustainable.  Since the tax is linked to the production of goods and services such as electricity, which the consumer cannot live without, there will be constant political pressure on the government to remove the tax. \\n\\nThe labour government is convinced that the carbon tax will work successfully in achieving its aims of lowering greenhouse gases and promoting green energy. The government believes in the concept of climate change, which was a contributing factor towards their decision of developing of this policy. Australian’s are the highest per capita polluters in the developed world, so it does make sense that Australia should join the ranks of other countries such as France and Denmark in introducing a carbon tax. However, the question remains as to weather such a tax will reduce pollution. There are no guarantees that emissions will decline if consumption of the goods and services that produce carbon emissions remains unresponsive to price increases. \\n\\nThe liberal government knows that climate change has not been proven, and that studies are still sketchy. Therefore, their approach has been to adopt the stance of not believing in climate change and going against the carbon tax policy. This could be a clever tactic if the policy is proven to be ineffective after its implementation. \\nThe carbon tax has without a doubt been a huge talking point within Australia and its potential success is crucial to the survival of the labor government.
== salt water crockdile ==\\n\\nSaltwater crocodiles are extremely dangerous animals, but data on attacks are limited outside of Australia, and estimates of human fatalities vary wildly between dozens to thousands annually. It is likely that, given this species' low population within most of its non-Australian / New Guinean range, the number of attacks is probably within the lower range of estimates. Most attacks by adult "salties" are fatal, given the animals' size and strength. In Australia, attacks are rare and usually make headlines when they do occur. There are, on average, no more than one or two fatal attacks reported per year in the country.[25] The low level of attacks is most likely due to the extensive effort by local wildlife officials to post crocodile warning signs at nearly every billabong, river, lake and even at some beaches and also due to the relatively well-informed nature of the local citizens. In the Aboriginal community of Arnhem Land, which occupies roughly half of the top end of the Northern Territory, attacks may go unreported and may be more common. There have also been recent, less-publicized attacks in Borneo,[26] Sumatra,[27] eastern India,[28] and in Myanmar.[29]\\nthere are two types of crockadile a fresh one and a salt water one.\\n\\n== chembackolie ==\\n\\nchemabackolie is in ammrica and the wheather is monsoon sun
Farmland Flooding in Northeast South Dakota (Brown County)\\n\\nThe weekend of May 5-6, 2007 brought heavy rainfall throughout South Dakota.  Northeast of Aberdeen, Columbia, SD received nine inches of precipitation in one shot.\\nMuch of this area was in need of rain, with the previous summer’s near drought conditions.  (June and July 2006 had less than an inch of rain in the same area.)  The heavy rains caused flooding throughout the county.  There were flooded basements, closed (flooded) roads, and school delays because of the heavy rains.  This also caused many problems for area farmers.  Some crops that had already been planted were now washed away or flooded out.  Replanted crops face maturity problems because of fall frost.  Even though most would never frown upon rain, it has created new problems and challenges to face.  \\n\\n[[User:Caradennert|Cara Dennert]] 23:20, 24 June 2007 (UTC)
'''Non Deliverable Forwards:'''''[[Italic text]]''\\n\\nThe standard FX transaction was designed to facilitate the exchange of notional currencies for the purpose of cross-border commerce.  The standard FX forward transaction allows for parties to the transaction to agree a rate of exchange days, weeks, months or even years in advance of the actual transaction occurring.  The use of these transactions has evolved from its original purpose.  FX transactions are commonly used to hedge exposure to exchange rate risk.  An example of such use would be a manufacturing company making a product in Europe and selling the product in the United States.  Such an organisation would have expenditure (plant, machinery, salary etc.) in Euros and revenue (from the sales of its product) in US Dollars.  If the value of the Euro against the US Dollar increases, the cost base, relative to revenues, would increase, resulting in less profit.  Conversely, the company would become more profitable if the value of the US Dollar increased against the Euro.  To hedge against fluctuations in the exchange rate, the company might enter into a forward FX contract to sell US Dollars against Euros at the end of its fiscal year.  If the value of the Euro increased against the US Dollar, the core business of the company would be less profitable.  However, the value of the FX contract would increase and the profit from this transaction would offset the reduction in profitability.\\n\\nThis hedging strategy works well if currency exchange between the two counties is unrestricted.  However, when exchange controls are in place, the strategy becomes less effective.  This is particularly true in countries where the exchange controls either forbid, or heavily penalise large cross-border cash transfers.  The Non-Deliverable Forward transaction was designed to overcome some of the problems of exchange controls by eliminating the need for cross-border cash transfers without eliminating the risk profile (and hence the hedge effectiveness) of the transaction.
 Light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength that is visible to the eye (visible light) or, in a technical or scientific context, electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength. The elementary particle that defines light is the photon. The three basic dimensions of light (i.e., all electromagnetic radiation) are:\\n\\nIntensity (or amplitude), which is related to the human perception of brightness of the light, \\nFrequency (or wavelength), perceived by humans as the color of the light, and \\nPolarization (or angle of vibration), which is only weakly perceptible by humans under ordinary circumstances. \\nDue to the wave-particle duality of matter, light simultaneously exhibits properties of both waves and particles. The precise nature of light is one of the key questions of modern physics.
Sustainable Cleaning\\n\\nIn the 1980’s the United Nations created a commission title the UN Decade for Education for Sustainable Development in response to a growing realization of the need to balance economic and social progress with the concerns for the environment.  The Commission defined sustainable development in the publication as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. \\n\\n\\nPeople and corporations need to be responsible and do the right thing when it comes to protecting our earth.  There are many factors that can help contribute to sustainability, but the one discussed here is chemicals.  Each year, millions of tons of carcinogens are washed down drains.  Harsh chemicals in cleaning products often contain chemicals that have adverse effects on the environment.  In addition to negative effects on the environment, chemical cleaning products also have health effects on those that work with them on a daily basis or are exposed to them in the workplace.  \\n\\n\\n"Green chemicals" started to show up in the marketplace in the late 1980's.  However, during the introduction stages of these types of products, many companies purchased these chemicals at premium prices only to learn that they did not work.  Recently with improvements in technology and a better understanding of customer needs, several companies have began to develop cleaning products that work, are priced right, and are better for the environment and human health.  Today, many businesses are beginning to use sustainable cleaning chemicals to clean their facilities.  Employees, workers, and customers were demanding it.  But, with so many products out there to choose from, how do you know which ones to pick?\\n\\n\\nWhile Green Seal and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Design for the Environment (DfE) program are a good benchmark, they should not be the only consideration if you are selecting green cleaning products.  One item that may be helpful to remember that certifications are based on a process that can take a long time to complete.  Therefore, while these certifications are relevant, they may not be the most up-to-date source of information in "green" chemicals.  Some other helpful tips might include reviewing the ingredients in the product.  Are they made from naturally derived ingredients like sugar, surfactants, citrus, milk and soybeans?  Natural ingredients in products are effective cleaners and are more sustainable for human health and the environment.  Another tip is looking at the company supplying the product.  What is their commitment to Sustainability and how long have they been manufacturing the product?\\n\\n\\nAn innovator in this space is a company called Coastwide Laboratories, a regional distributor located in the Pacific Northwest.  Coastwide began looking into this area in the early 1980's.  Chief Science Officer, Roger McFadden reviewed several products and found various harmful ingredients such as volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde, and carcinogens in the products.  McFadden recognized the danger in these chemicals and developed the Sustainable Cleaning Product Design Standard (SEGC-114) in which all products developed by the manufacturer must comply with.  In addition, the company developed a “green gatekeeper” policy that made sure that cleaning chemicals that they distribute also meet their sustainability requirements.  \\n\\n\\nMcFadden developed the Sustainable Earth® product line is 2003.  This development marks the first time a performance-driven product also complied with SEGC-114, Green Seal, and DfE requirements.  In July 2007, Sustainable Earth® became available to a national audience and made the product available to businesses everywhere in the U.S.\\n\\n[[User:Niccol9132|Niccol9132]] 14:41, 16 July 2007 (UTC)
== assassin ==\\n\\na murderer, one who kills a person for fanatical,financial or monetary reasons.\\n\\n\\n:history:\\n\\nActive in Persia and Syria from the 8th to 14th centuries, the original Assassins were members of the Nizaris, a Muslim group who opposed the Abbasid caliphate with threats of sudden assassination by their secret agents. Other populations of the area regarded the Nizaris as unorthodox outcasts, and from this attitude came one of the names for the group, ḥaššāšīn, a word originally meaning "hashish users," which had become a general term of abuse. Reliable sources offer no evidence of hashish use by Nizari agents, but sensationalistic stories of murderous, drug-crazed ḥaššāšīn or Assassins were widely repeated in Europe. Marco Polo tells a tale of how young Assassins were given a potion and made to yearn for paradise—their reward for dying in action—by being given a life of pleasure. As the legends spread, the word ḥaššāšīn passed through French or Italian and appeared in English as assassin in the 16th century, already with meanings like "treacherous killer."\\n\\n:modern assassins:\\n\\n\\nIt is clear that assassins have taken a new shape today, using silenced guns, or the cliché knife. But, this idea of assassins derived long before video games and modern depictions. It derived in a time when it was necessary for survival. It was in fact a well-utilized tool to save their country from utter destruction.

Deforestation : Africa’s deforestation rate is twice that of the world’s. 90% of Africa’s population requires wood to use as fuel for heating and cooking. The rate of illegal logging, which is another main cause of deforestation, varies from country to country, such as 50% in Cameroon and 80% in Liberia. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, deforestation is primarily caused by the needs of the poor, along with unsupervised logging and mining.\\nIn Ethiopia, the main cause is the country’s growing population, which induces an increase in agriculture, livestock production, and fuel wood. Low education and little government intervention also contributes to deforestation. Madagascar’s forest loss is partially caused by citizens using slash-and-burn techniques after independence from the French.\\nNigeria has the highest rate of deforestation of primary forests, according to the FAO. Deforestation in Nigeria is caused by logging, subsistence agriculture, and the collection of wood for fuel. \\nAccording to the FAO, deforestation has wiped out nearly 90% of Africa’s forest. West Africa only has 22.8% of its moist forests left, and 81% of Nigeria’s old-growth forests disappeared within 15 years. Deforestation also lowers the chance of rainfall; Ethiopia has experienced famine and droughts because of this. 98% of Ethiopia’s forests have disappeared over the last 50 years.\\nWithin 43 years, Kenya’s forest coverage decreased from about 10% to 1.7%. Deforestation in Madagascar has also led to desertification, soil loss, and water source degradation, resulting in the country’s inability to provide necessary resources for its growing population. In the last five years, Nigeria lost nearly half of its primary forests. Ethiopia’s government, along with organizations like Farm Africa, is starting to take steps to stop excessive deforestation <ref>{{cite web|title=Deforestation by Region|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_by_region|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>. \\n\\n2.

In many countries, the use of leaded gasoline is still widespread, and vehicle emission controls are nonexistent.

Oliver, British Columbia, is a small town located in the South Okanagan. Billing itself as the "Wine Capital of Canada," Oliver is renowned for its high quality wine. The climate and topography offer the optimum conditions necessary to grow the preferred Vinifera wine grapes and the town has the largest concentration of both vineyards and commercial wineries in British Columbia. Approximately 30 wineries are located within 15 minutes of Oliver. Many of these are located along what is known as the Golden Mile of Highway 97, just south of Oliver. The rolling terraces, exceptionally mild climate with lots of sun, gravelly soil and availability of irrigation produce the right elements for growing high-quality grapes, as well as cherries, peaches and other soft fruits.
{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n\\n==Public space notes==\\nOwnership of public space can confuse the perception of what is public space and what is accessible by the public. The general assumption is that government owned external land is public space but with several exceptions such as military sites or government buildings that do not have a public function (such as the gardens of the White House or the lawns of the Pentagon). Space owned by private organisations such as churches, corporations or charities can offer public access to their space, but with rules that do not apply to state owned public space. graveyards, National Trust coast line and art galleries blur this distinction of not always being state owned, but can be treated in many respects as Public Space.\\n\\nThe time of day can also change the way Public Space may be used. At 12 noon, office workers may be encouraged to use an office plaza for lunchtime, but at 12 midnight, loitering may not at all be acceptable.
Sexual identity is associated with sex, gender, and sexual orientation. Sex is biologically and based on ones anatomy. Gender is the intergrated cognitive, social. And emotional schemes assosiciated with being male or female. Sexual orientation refers to ones preference for and attraction to sexually intimate partners. Sexual identity begins with the formation of gender identity in early childhood. (Newman). It involves applying the correct gender label and gender stability and consistancy. Sexual identity is later developed and formed during adolescence. Adolescence is a stage in which great identity (and sexual identity) confusion and exploration occurs. During adolescence we begin to apply and test the gender labels we have provided for ourselves. We do this through intimate and sexual relationships. During this stage, one can change their sexual orientation and identity.\\n\\nSexual orientation refers to ones preference and attraction to sexual partners. The terms used to describe sexual orientation includes, heterosexual (straight), homosexual (gay/lesbian), bisexual (attraction to both sexes), and asexual (no attraction to either sex). Once a person feels confident on their sexual orientation, has gender stability and consistence, that is when their sexual identity is formed.
'''Terrorism – A Global Issue'''\\n\\n----\\n\\n\\n\\nTerrorism is one of the most serious challenges the world faces today. It is war against democracy and crime against humanity. It has crossed national boundaries and has international ramifications. It is a new variant of genocide which threatens national unity and sovereignty. Terrorism in one way is a new threat to humanity in the 21st century. Terrorism is violence used by a few against fellow human beings. Terrorist have total disregard for human lives including their own. Violence is an essential part of terrorism. Terrorism is a systematic use of violence or the threat of violence to achieve specific political goals. It attempts to use violence to cause widespread panic, fear or terror to achieve its ultimate political aim. This fusion of crime and politics gives birth to terrorism. Terrorist use violence to demoralize the government and ultimately push them to a situation of counter violence. In this struggle it is the civilian population which suffers the most – physically, mentally and economically. Terrorism which is confined within the national boundary and is directed against one’s own government is called Insurgency.\\n\\nFew words are as politically or emotionally charged as terrorism. One 1988 study by the US Army found that over 100 definitions of the word "terrorism" have been used. Acts of terrorism are not intended to merely victimize or eliminate those who are killed, injured or taken hostage but rather to intimidate and influence the societies to which they belong. Modern terrorism has come to be defined in part by the influential power of the mass media that terrorists co-opt in their efforts to amplify and broadcast feelings of intense fear and anger. As a type of unconventional warfare, terrorism is designed to weaken or supplant existing political landscapes through capitulation or acquiescence as opposed to subversion or action. “Terrorist attacks" are usually characterized as "indiscriminate", "targeting of civilians" or executed "with disregard for human life". The term "terrorism" is often used to assert that the political violence of an enemy is immoral, wanton and unjustified. According to the most common definition of terrorism typically used by states, academics, counter-terrorism experts and non-governmental organizations, "terrorists" are actors who don't belong to any recognized armed forces or who don't adhere to the laws of war and who are, therefore, regarded as "rogue actors". Those who are accused of being "terrorists" rarely identify themselves as such and, instead, typically use terms that refer to their ideological or ethnic struggle, such as: separatist, freedom fighter, liberator, revolutionary, vigilante, militant, paramilitary, guerrilla, rebel, jihadi or mujaheddin, or fedayeen or any one of similar-meaning words in a number of languages. Terrorism has been used by a broad array of organizations to further their objectives. They including right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic and religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments. \\nTerrorism in the past was found in different places. Terrorism [terrorism] the threat or use of violence, often against the civilian population, to achieve political or social ends, to intimidate opponents, or to publicize grievances. The term dates from the Reign of Terror (1793-94) in the French Revolution but has taken on additional meaning in the 20th cent. Terrorism involves activities such as assassinations, bombings, random killings, and hijackings. Used for political, not military, purposes, and most typically by groups too weak to mount open assaults, it is a modern tool of the alienated, and its psychological impact on the public has increased because of extensive coverage by the media. Political terrorism also may be part of a government campaign to eliminate the opposition, as under Hitler, Mussolini , Stalin , and others, or may be part of a revolutionary effort to overthrow a regime. Terrorist attacks also are now a common tactic in guerrilla warfare. Governments find attacks by terrorist groups difficult to prevent; international agreements to tighten\\nIn the past few decades India has been badly affected by terrorist. Some hostile countries encourage fundamentalist forces, separatist tendencies and terrorism in India. As a result, secularism in India, which is built upon the principle of unity in diversity, gets adversely affected. Terrorism poses a direct threat to national sovereignty, territorial integrity and democracy in India. Some well known terrorist in India are People’s war group (PWG), Maoists communists centre (MCC) and the IKF. The world too has seen many terrorist in the past few years. The whole world has been shaken by the destruction caused by these terrorists. The major terrorist associations are Al-Qaeda and Taliban. Al-Qaeda was a association created by the great Taliban leader Osama Bin Ladein who ruthlessly caused the destruction of the World Trade Centre, Washington D.C on 9th September 2001.  He also crashed an airplane on the Pentagon, USA. \\n\\nAl-Qaeda or Al-Qaida is an armed Sunni Islamic organization with the stated objective of eliminating foreign influence in Muslim countries. The most prominent members of the group are adherents of Wahabism, an extreme, militant sect of Islam. While Osama Bin Ladein is generally recognized as the group’s leader, the group’s operations are not centralized, and many independent and collaborative cells exist in multiple countries linked by a common cause.\\nAs a matter of fact, all sectors are put to a stand still due to these terror strikes. The direct effect of these is seen in the sudden drop in the markets. The stock prices do drop down and the trading comes to a stand still, however the business seldom stops and the markets show their cushioning effect by regaining the vigor. But at times the loss of even trading day can be fatal to a country’s economy. Such attacks also incur a direct burden on the defense budget. It goes without saying that the governments do take desperate measures to minimize the losses and cover the country against the future threats. The new areas of defense research open up and thus fresh jobs are created. This brighter side of the attacks is over-shadowed by the loss of lives and panic that is created with in the country. The government, under such circumstances, looses the track of their priorities and the developmental works are sidelined. This causes damage to civic society. The worst hit by terrorist activities is the third world countries. The terrorists make these vulnerable counties their bases and from here carry out the destructive activities. Their influence in such countries shows and threatens the developed world of their power and dominance. Thus such countries make an appropriate guinea pig. If a terrorists strike a big country or a city, the whole world knows about it. The tragedy with these countries is that their miseries are not broadcasted because of their non connectivity with the rest of the world. They are thus the breeding grounds of terrorism and worst hit areas by this destructive activity. \\nFive years after the 9/11, the main security threat faced by nations is not Al-Qaeda. It is the growing ability of small groups to inflict levels of damage unprecedented in history, and the growing inability of nations to check it. Through history, the state has been powerful and individuals weak. But education and technology have now made small groups powerful enough to threaten or decimate the state. This is true of both Islamic and non-Islamic groups. It is Trans-religious.\\nIRA cadres in Ireland and Basque terrorists in Spain and France are Christian terrorists. The Tamil tigers in Sri Lanka are Hindu terrorists who invented suicide bombing. In the 1970s and 1980s, the JVP in Sri Lanka represented Buddhism. The Aum Shinrikyo killed thousands with nerve gas in Tokyo. Maoists in Nepal represent secular terrorism. So do Indian Maoists who operate in 162 out of 602districts. Islamic terrorists have plenty of company. In the US itself, the Unabomber Kaczynski maimed and killed peopled for 18 years before being caught. The Oklahoma bombers killed 168 people in 1995. After 9/11, envelopes with anthrax were sent to the capitol and other places, causing panic in Washington. \\nDeadly explosives like RDX are available globally through sophisticated black markets, sometimes through the internet. So are Assault rifles, grenades and rockets. Cell phones provide communications that only the most sophisticated armies once had. Throw-away cell phones and changing e-mail address provide enough anonymity to foil the most sophisticated, Powerful intelligence agencies.\\nTo change things there should be understanding between people and the willingness to rise against this form of corruptive disaster. Corruption is another cause for all the terrorist activities. The future looks grim. With advancing technology, small groups will become even more powerful, and the state will become even less capable of stopping them. The state will probably respond by acquiring draconian powers and crushing civil liberties.
First and foremost, we must not subject ourselves to the corporate media monster to define and verify the existance of language. Thus, Google may not be used as a barometer of linguistics. Second, panic attacks, although catagorically similiar in causation (i.e. stress, anxiety, and claustrophobia) the panic leave is a separated and clearly distinguishible from panic attacks by its own subjugation of environmental factors. The combination of panic attacks and panic leaves is only a trivial matter since the mere occurance of both phenomena would be an improbability.  Lastly, Wikipedia must join hands with the international community to set itself above the constraints of our cyberspace network in order to insure and embrace the evolution of Language. \\nFrancis Macomber
'''CSSDP''' The [[Canadian Students for Sensible Drug Policy]] is a national, grassroots, youth and student network. We provide the necessary education and resources to empower chapters formed by youth and students to work on substance use issues facing their community. Chapters do everything from peer and public education, to drug policy reform and harm reduction projects. In all these areas we support an approach scientifically studied and proven to be effective in decreasing the negative impact of drugs and drug policies on individuals, families and communities. '''Harm Reduction Policies''' ''Drugs are a Health issue''. All policies and programs aimed at reducing the harms associated with drug use in society should address the issue as a public health concern, not as a criminal justice issue. This has been proven to be more effective by studies worldwide.  '''Education''' ''Accessibility'' The Centre for Excellence in Youth Engagement has found that drug education and prevention programs that meet young people where they are at, even if they are using drugs and [[alcohol]], are the most effective.Education programs like DARE, run by the Police, may be effective in reminding youth that drugs are illegal. However, they have been highly ineffective in seriously reaching young people about drugs in their personal lives. ''Honest, Open Dialogue'' Drug education is an empowerment. Young people should be provided with all the information available and encouraged to make their own decisions about their physical and mental health. All education should acknowledge and respect young people’s personal experience, a discussion that should be approached only in a space of compassion and non-judgment.
  l. Sending Zealots to DeathsDear Editor: The recent talk by the pope given in an academic setting has set the world on fire. Muslims have gone on a rampage, murdering priests and nuns and attacking churches. If this is done out of religious zeal, the perpetrators put their religion in a bad light. If it is condoned by the Muslim clergy, they do a disservice to all Muslims. Clergy, whether Christian or Muslim, are human. They are not immune to temptation or error. However, if they are acting contrary to the tenets of their religion, their superiors or colleagues should correct them. We know that the slaughter visited on Muslim civilians by fellow Muslims in Iraq is inconsistent with the teaching of the Koran. I have read and reread the Koran searching for anything that will justify the practice of teaching children that Allah will reward them if they strap explosives around their body, go into a market place, board a bus or enter a restaurant and blow themselves up, killing and maiming fellow Muslims. It appears that some Imams are involved in promoting this practice. If this is a worthy endeavor, when will we see an Imam become a martyr? It is time for Imams and Muslim leaders to denounce their brethren who perpetrate, or approve, these atrocities and purge their ranks of those who violate the commands of Allah and employ the tools of Satan in their nefarious work.If this is a legitimate tactic in a holy war, it is time for an Imam or two to come forward and blow themselves up for the cause. Why do they not join the young suicides in the sacrifice of their lives?\\n  \\n \\nFrancis J. Donovan

This paragraph needs to be re-written before being included as it contains a significant misconception. The tank does not create a "zero gravity" environment and the bit about "where gravity is and in which direction" is poorly worded. It is, however, correct that the brain does use a high proportion of its energy to maintain muscle contractions for balance but this is done subconciously so there is no space to "free [the brain] to attend to other matters". I'm sure there are many potential benefits from relaxation such as this but it would be better to leave out the incorrect use of scientific concepts such as gravity in this case. \\n\\n== Gravity ==\\n\\nDue to the high salt levels in the water, the floatation tank creates a zero gravity environment. Zero gravity allows the user to relax every single muscle: neck, arms, back and even ears. The tank enables the user to find those areas which are being held tense so they can be relaxed. Finding where gravity is and in which direction, then computing how the body can move and not fall over, takes about 90% of the brain's activity on a daily basis. Dr. Lilly's theory explains that when a user gets into the floateria capsule, the brain and body are free from all the gravity computations and the physical world. This leaves the brain free to attend to other matters.
Antartica is a quite "primitive" country. It is uncivilized (to some extent) however, there are a select few who still inhabit this age-old "block of ice". As of 5:46 P.M. central time, April 21st, 2007, the country was conquered and is now under the sole responsibility of Richard Smith, a native to the United States. He is currently requesting any help that anyone will gladly offer; fundage is a most significant point of focus. If you have any talent(s) whatsoever, such as repairing lawn mowers, making cheese sandwiches, eating peanut butter, etc., you can help him in his attempt to develop a more advanced civilization. You will be gladly granted citizenship in your effort towards making Antarctica a better place to live. Polar bear wranglers are another necessity we ask for. Much of the past civilization (1 out of 3 people) have been eaten by polar bears. It was only one bear that has been a pain in the ass, but still, come on, we can't have that.

The Quest for Environmental Justice in the National Park System\\n\\n=== Introduction === \\nFrom its inception, the national park system had the dual goal of improving conservation of natural resources and creating places of enjoyment for the public and future generations. Currently, in 2012 there are over 10,000 protected areas around the world, with 365 national parks located in the United States alone (Tilden 1951:13). In light of the prevalence of protected environmental areas worldwide, it is important to assess the social as well as environmental impacts of the creation of national parks. Little attention has been placed on evaluating the extent to which environmental justice is achieved within the park system, which is of particular concern as bioprospecting efforts and forced relocations of indigenous populations increase. \\n\\n\\nEnvironmental justice within national parks primarily concerns locals’ access rights, which are dictated by the political and social institutions that govern protected areas. The EPA defines environmental justice as, “The fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies” (Miller et al. 2003:G5). Given the EPA’s definition, environmental justice necessitates the involvement by local populations in the national park system. Yet limited access rights and restricted management participation, in addition to ideological legacies of national parks that stem from Eurocentric views of the environment, have made it challenging to achieve environmental justice fully. To facilitate scholarly discussion about environmental justice within the national park system, the central issues that obstruct justice will be presented, followed by methods to overcome these obstacles to achieve the multifaceted goal of promoting conservation, sustainability, and recreation fairly for all populations. \\n\\n=== The Establishment of National Parks ===\\n \\n==== Motives ==== \\nThere is some debate about the true intentions behind creating national parks. While some historians assert that the national parks were developed with altruistic intentions of ecological preservation and wildlife protection (Kuo 2012:728), biodiversity protection and conservation (Cernea 2006:1809), and out of closeness with nature, the actual motives for creating land preservations may have been much darker. Other historians, ecologists, and anthropologists contend that the national park system arose because certain land was not profitable as a source of agricultural or timber production (Kuo 2012:728). \\n\\nWarwick Frost and Michael Hall claimed that the motivation for the creation of the national park varied between different countries to fit each country’s needs (Frost et al. 2009:357). While national parks were set up to promote outdoor recreation in countries like the United States and Canada, the underlying factor for creation of the parks however, is purely economic (Frost et al. 2009:357). The notion of the national park relied primarily on the perceptions of “worthless land (for large scale mining or agricultural production), tourism’s economic value on the land, and an acute demand for places for public enjoyment” (Frost et al. 2009:357). Robert Turner, in Market Failures and the Rationale for National Parks, asserts that national parks were established in order to create a sense of national identity, and to protect important historical and ecological resources (Turner 2002:350). Although he notes that national parks successfully preserve ecosystems, conserve biodiversity, protect wildlife, and safeguard native cultures, he ultimately argues that market failures (i.e. unprofitable land) are used as justification for national parks (Turner 2002:347-350).  \\n\\n==== Western Ideologies of the Environment ==== \\nDiffering views toward the environment and peoples’ role within it, dictates the way that land is utilized and managed. As Dahlberg, Rohde, and Sandell astutely observed, “Conservation of protected areas is primarily about how we perceive such landscapes, how we place differential values on different landscape components, and who gets to decide on these values” (Dahlberg et al. 2010:209). Thus, society’s perception of the environment, as well as the social and political institutions that decide which landscapes to protect, play significant roles in the determination of national park regions. \\nWestern ideologies regarding the environment typically neglected the interplay between man and forest, and portrayed nature as pristine and untouched by local populations. The areas that received attention as natural environments worthy of protection were those that were free of human activity, and there was general disregard for the significance of the relationship indigenous populations maintained with the land (Dahlberg et al. 2010:210).\\n\\n\\nThe Eurocentric view of pristine nature and wilderness dictated which lands were ultimately selected as national parks. The National Park Service sought to “Preserve, in a condition as unaltered as is humanly possible, the wilderness that greeted the eyes of the first white men who challenged and conquered it,” said Freeman Tilden (Tilden 1951:417). Tilden’s remarks accurately depict the white elitist views that shaped the park system. Tilden highlights the point that, according to traditional Western ideologies, nature is seen juxtaposed with mankind, and minority populations are considered to be submissive to whites. This tainted perception of the relationship between indigenous populations and the environment severely limited local access to the land, because white elitists looked down upon locals’ dependence on the environment and their use of natural resources (Frost et al. 2009:357). Since the institutions and sectors of society that possessed the most power were predominately white, Western ideologies formed the basis for the national park system and continue to impede environmental justice because the basic principles the park system was founded upon were unjust. \\n\\n=== Forced Displacement of Indigenous Populations ===\\nOne of the most difficult obstacles to environmental justice in the national park system lies in the fact that indigenous populations, who both lived on and shaped the land, are forced to relocate if their territory is selected for a national park citing. This unfair eradication of local communities results in local communities bearing a disproportionate cost of conservation (MacKenzie 2012:93).\\nDisplaced populations face a slew of economic, social, and political problems. Compulsory removal processes leave locals without their land, homes, and source of income. The lifestyles of local communities that revolved around hunting and gathering, for example, cannot be altered instantaneously. Compensation for displacement is rarely commensurate with the value of all that is lost during relocation, and this unfairly hurts the livelihoods of locals. \\n\\nForced displacements additionally strip locals of their connection with the land and along with it, their cultural identity. Displaced individuals face the risk of marginalization by society, especially when they relocate to regions with different cultural, social, and economic backgrounds (Cernea 2006:1829). In addition to these social ramifications, locals are further disempowered by the denial of both human rights and positions of authority as managers of national parks. Community members are endowed with the right to utilize and live on land that they inhabited for hundreds of years, and they have the right to be justly compensated should they decide to relocate for the creation of a national park. However, the social institutions that protect the rights of local communities are lacking and require improvement (Cernea 2006:1829). \\nAdditionally, forced displacement of indigenous populations negatively impact biodiversity. The livelihoods of local communities depends on natural resources found in the park, and there is a tendency for displaced individuals to return to national parks to continue to hunt and gather food, even though it is now illegal for them to do so. Also, evicted persons contribute to unsustainable resource use outside of national parks by putting stress on the environment and ecological resources in already overpopulated regions (Cernea 2006:1828). Given the risks to biodiversity posed by forced relocations, it seems only logical to protect both the human rights of communities and the environment, by halting coerced displacements. As Cernea advocated, the forced relocations, “that destroy people’s livelihood and trample on their human rights should not be done” (Cernea 2006: 1829).\\n\\n=== Environmental Racism === \\nEnvironmental racism occurs when minority populations are unfairly exposed to contamination, pollution, and degraded environments due to their race and inferior political and economic status. In light of current opinions which claim national park land was selected based on the economic uselessness of land and originated from a white elitist perception of nature, it comes as no surprise that environmental racism plays a role in the obstruction of justice in the park system. \\n\\nThe Eurocentric ideologies that shaped the formation of protected areas do not promote local engagement or increase community benefits. Cernea makes this point eloquently; “Science and nationalism have been employed by powerful elites to justify exclusion and control of national parks” (Cernea 2006: 1808). Land belonging to poor and marginalized communities was targeted for situating national parks by elites who disregarded rights of locals, and locals were further disempowered by displacement from their homeland (Cernea 2006:1827). Moreover, while whites benefited from the creation of national parks, other minorities bore disproportionate costs of conservation. “For the white elite, national parks and other protected areas became popular for recreational purposes and access opportunities increased; The management structures of national parks worked to alienate black people from land and landscapes that had previously been part of their identity and knowledge base” (Ramutsindela 2004:1). \\nWhile some nations including the United States, sought to develop a sense national identity through the development of national parks, minority communities were stripped of identities that they developed over centuries of inhabiting the land. \\n\\nLocals who are displaced by national parks do not enjoy the same economic and political status, or overall wellbeing as other parts of society. Resettlers face increased morbidity and mortality from exposure to more different diseases, compounded by the fact that they are less able to pay for expensive medical care (Cernea 2006:1826). For example, in the Botwa population in Africa, the child mortality rate was a staggering 47.7% in 2004; triple that of Uganda’s national average of 14.1% (Cernea 2006:1826). \\n\\n=== Poverty === \\n\\nForced resettlements of local populations upon park establishment inflicted poverty and caused negative ramifications for locals, compromising the quest for conservation and biodiversity. Displacement of local populations expels individuals from their source of income and diminishes their standards of living. Studies conducted by Michael Cernea found that the majority of displaced people went on to find marginalized jobs that did not pay well and were further impoverished by lack of compensation by the park system (Cernea 2006:1820-1824). Moreover, research conducted in Africa found that more than 80% of the displaced Batwa population remained uncompensated for their loss of land and did not have homes after six years of displacement (Cernea 2006:1828).\\n\\nCernea criticizes the national park system for its lack of regard for the economic and social costs from the creation of preservation areas, and he promotes the concept of double sustainability which entails a dual pursuit of people’s livelihoods and biodiversity (Cernea 2006: 1808-1830). One flaw in the national park system is that it tends to pay attention only to the environment, while it disregards the role indigenous populations maintain with nature and the social and economic effects of park development. \\n\\n=== Ecotourism === \\nEcotourism is touted as a green industry and has its roots embedded in the formation of the national park system (Frost et al. 2009:729). This form of tourism focuses on nature and aims to improve conservation and sustainability while fostering an appreciation for cultural heritage. Despite the potential monetary and environmental benefits of ecotourism, there are also negative impacts that accompany this market practice. \\nEcotourism’s altruistic goals are often compromised by “demand for access, construction of tourism facilities, and the wide spread ill-behavior of visitors” (Frost et al. 2009:729). The increasing development of land that was set aside for the sake of preservation, defeats the purpose of creating the national park in the first place. Moreover, increasing populations and stresses on natural resources prohibit national parks from fully achieving conservation. This calls into question the “applicability of the national park concept,” because if the system does not adequately further conservation and an appreciation for nature, then the system could be deemed a failure (Frost et al. 2009:729). Despite Burnett and Bulters’ positive views on the national park system regarding conservation, these authors affirmed the inherent problem in using the national park as a development (tourism) tool for its preservation objectives (Burnett et al. 1987:41). Too often, economic incentives overtake ecological goals of conservation thereby defeating the purpose of the park system. \\n\\nCernea similarly voices concern over ecotourism. Despite ecotourism’s reputation as something that promotes biodiversity and conservation efforts, it rarely generates benefits that outweigh the costs of increased tourism. “The most recent GEF study recognized about such assumed ecotourism benefits that ‘it is highly unlikely that revenue from wildlife and tourism will ever constitute a particular large source of income for all members of a community’” (Cernea 2006:1827). Furthermore, the stark disregard for indigenous people’s role in the environment and their lack of political influence in developing and managing parks, leave local communities disempowered.  \\n\\n=== Bioprospecting === \\nBioprospecting is the commercial use of biological resources and traditional knowledge in the development of new products (Hayden 2003:359). Bioprospecting has become more prevalent worldwide as scientists and pharmaceutical companies endeavor to uncover biological resources and develop new ways to utilize fauna and flora. However, there is often failure by commercial companies and scientists to properly compensate or recognize the contributions from locals’ knowledge. Today, more and more large companies and research groups view national parks as potential bioprospecting sources, which calls into question the role national parks should play in supplying commercially exploitable resources to these entities.\\n\\nProponents of bioprospecting in national parks view the parks as a library of environmental knowledge and resources (Jansen et al. 1998:39). The knowledge and information that could be obtained within national parks might, according to bioprospecting supporters, greatly benefit society. Furthermore, in order to properly preserve the geologic features within the parks, it is necessary to have an in depth understanding of its resources and this necessitates scientific research. \\n\\nIn addition to the appeal of scientific information that could provide useful products and tools for society, economic incentives also entice the Park Service to encourage bioprospecting efforts. Poor funding and commercial pressures from companies and research facilities make it increasingly difficult for the Park Service to deny bioprospecting companies’ access to the parks’ biological resources (Jansen et al. 1998:44). These unexpected monetary gains from national parks’ resources appear to be an additional benefit, but in reality, income from bioprospecting is usually small, and by engaging in bioprospecting, national parks fail to uphold their duties as places of conservation and public enjoyment. \\n\\n==== The Case of Bioprospecting in Yellowstone ==== \\nControversy surrounding bioprospecting in national parks is especially evident in the case of Yellowstone National Park. As the first national park in the world, Yellowstone is expected to provide an example of the qualities a national park should possess. Notably, the goals of the national park system are to preserve scenery, natural resources, and aid conservation in a “natural and unimpaired state for the benefit and inspiration of all people” (Jansen et al. 1998:45). Bioprospecting in Yellowstone however, compromised the aforementioned goals. \\nIn 1997 Yellowstone National Park signed an agreement with the biotechnical company, Diversa, to allow Diversa to collect organisms from thermal pools in search of commercially exploitable products (Doremus 1991:407-409). In exchange for access to Yellowstone’s resources, Diversa would pay Yellowstone $20,000 per year plus royalties from revenues generated by the bioprospecting products (Doremus 1991:409). However, the financial costs were twice as much as the cash return to Yellowstone, and in 1998 plaintiffs from the Edmonds Institute sued the Park Service for not preparing an Environmental Impact Statement before allowing Diversa to carry out bioprospecting in Yellowstone (Doremus 1991:411). This private expropriation of public resources was considered inappropriate (Jansen et al. 1998:45), and opponents viewed it as, “the kind of science the Park Service should not permit” (Doremus 191: 477).  \\n\\nFinancial incentives from bioprospecting dilute the goals of the national park system. While the argument that bioprospecting encourages conservation and a better understanding of the natural resources in national parks sounds appealing, no economic inducement should be necessary to protect national parks (Doremus 1999:401). National parks were originally created in order to promote conservation and foster a meaningful relationship between man and the environment – not for exploitation of natural resources. The paradigm shift from regarding parks as a place of conservation, to a place of economic gain, defeats the innate purpose of setting aside land as a protected area. Furthermore, it could create a slippery slope where the Park Service has no choice but to sell the parks’ biological resources in order to generate enough revenue to keep the parks up and running. Therefore, bioprospecting should be prohibited in national parks so that they may fulfill their original intentions of preserving the environment and wildlife for generations to come.  \\n\\n=== Local Access Rights ===\\nLocal indigenous populations too often lose their access to and ability to utilize land after it has been designed as a national park. Stemming back to the Eurocentric view of the environment as something pristine and untainted by mankind, the institutions that established protected areas sought to curtail locals’ utilization of the land. Unfortunately, this negatively impacted indigenous livelihoods because of the locals’ reliance on natural resources including forests, fish, and other game. “Local communities can perceive the loss of access to these [national parks] lands as limiting their ability to survive and building economies based on natural resource extraction from, or agricultural development, of these protected areas” (MacKenzie 2012:93). While individuals who are forced to relocate obviously have restricted access to cultivatable lands, they can also be prohibited in using the land and its resources in their traditional way. Restricted access, Cernea argues, is another form of forced displacement and severely hurts locals’ livelihoods (Cernea 2006:1809).  \\n\\n=== Room for Improvement === \\nDespite the aforementioned issues that make it difficult to achieve environmental justice for local populations, there are many ways the National Park Service can improve local’s access to the environment, decrease forced relocations, improve benefit sharing, limit impoverishment of displaced locals, halt bioprospecting, while concomitantly preserving the environment and fostering an appreciation of nature for the general public. These solutions require increased local involvement in the decision-making processes regarding national parks, and a restructuring of the political and social institutions that govern the parks. Environmental justice will only be achieved once a paradigm shift occurs that transitions away from the Eurocentric ideology of pristine nature, toward another that recognizes the interplay between the environment and indigenous populations. The following measures will help achieve these goals: \\n\\n	\\n* Reform the ideological contexts that dictated the way conservation efforts evolved. Recognize the different ways people view the environment and acknowledge the historical and cultural values of local populations.   \\n* 	Safeguard indigenous livelihoods by avoiding involuntary displacement operations that impoverish locals (Cernea 2006:1808).  \\n* 	Increase revenue sharing to benefit local communities while improving conservation efforts (MacKenzie 2012:93-97).   \\n* 	Provide more benefits to the locals who lost more due to the development of the park, instead of distributing compensation homogenously (MacKenzie 2012:93).  \\n* 	Halt bioprospecting in national parks in order to safeguard natural resources and local knowledge, without compromising the National Park System’s original goals to further conservation.   \\n* 	Include local communities in the process of establishing, planning, and developing national parks to provide them with the same political and human rights as other sectors of society.   \\n* 	Conservation agencies should be denied funds so long as they do not enact social safeguards to protect local communities from forced displacements from parks. These safeguards include policies consistent with those developed by the World Bank (Cernea 2006:1830).  \\n* 	Pursue double sustainability that protects both people’s livelihoods and natural resources, instead of focusing solely on the biological side (Cernea 2006:1830).  \\n\\n\\n\\nBurnett, G Wesley, and Lisa Mathis Butler\\n    1987 National Parks in the Third World and Associated National Characteristics.    \\n    Leisure Sciences, 9(1): 41.\\n\\nCernea, Michael M, and Kai Schmidt-Soltau. \\n     2006 Poverty Risks and National Parks: Policy Issues in Conservation and  \\n    Resettlement.

Mental/Squad Telepathy\\n          Mental telepathy has also been   referred to as "Squad Telepathy." \\nThe first origins were from Ancient Rome, when philosophers such as Aristotle\\n and Copernicus observed such patterns. They noticed that they had many of\\n the same ideas as the other philosophers that they associated with. Not much\\n was said or documented about these claims, as it was waved off as a coincidence.\\n Later, in the Renaissance, more philosophers noticed evidence of mental telepathy,\\nalso known as squad telepathy. It was documented for the first time during the\\n Renaissance by Galileo, when he conducted experiments with local peasants,\\n Knights, and even royalty. What he found was shocking. Some people are said\\n to have a certain gift of squad telepathy. These select few tend to have a few\\n common qualities. They have a strong connection with themselves, their associates,\\n the world around them, and a great sense of humor. Approximately ninety percent \\nof these subjects were also in excellent physical condition.\\n          Many modern studies have been conducted at the University of Miami and the\\n College of Notre Dame, where squad telepathy is very prevalent. The most recent case\\n was in a Notre Dame student in 1997. No since cases have been documented, but going\\n along with mental telepathy trends, a new "mind reader" is born approximately every\\n twenty years.
Chemistry is defined as the branch of science, which deals with the study of composition, structure and properties of matter and the changes, which the matter undergoes under different conditions and the laws which govern these changes. In fact the whole universe is made up of only two things\\ni.e. Matter and energy.\\nExperience has shown that all types of matter is defined as anything that occupier space, posses mass and the presence of which can be felt by any one or more of our five senses. The examples of matter are innumerable. A few of these include clothes, iron, gold, plastics, wood, milk, petrol, oil, air etc.
'''The Environmental impact of Uranium mining in Namibia'''\\n\\n[[Rossing Uranium Mine]] is owned by [[Rio Tinto Group]], the world’s largest mining group, which has annual Profits of over $1.4 billion.  It supplies enriched yellow cake uranium to power stations in France, UK, USA and Japan. The open-cast mine opened in 1976 and it has now been decided that the mine will close with the next few years. The company had an option of spending $100 million and expanding the mine, or closing down all operations by the year 2007; it close the latter. The mine also provides employment for 800 local people. In a country like [[Namibia]] which suffers from a severe lack of water, and has an annual rainfall of less than 30mm, that is a real probe Although mining causes environmental damage, these problems do not necessarily disappear with the closure of the mine. There are many dangerous waste products which would need to be disposed of and many methods that have been used at other mines in the past have been in effectual. Namibia is one of the African countries with a good environment compared to other countries.\\n\\nEvery prospecting and mining operation needs to comply with an environmental management plan (EMP), which is an outgrowth of the assessment of its environmental impacts (EIA). An EIA is mandatory before a prospecting or mining license is granted, and the EMP defines the activities that the operation must undertake to minimize environmental damage. The environmental impact of uranium mining in Namibia has also change the environment as Uranium mining is polluting the environment.  The uranium mining activities are done in the [[Namib-Naukluft National Park]], and this has even worried the Topnaar communities and has expressed their concern over the ongoing prospecting and mining of uranium in all areas that are protected because of their unique flora and fauna.  Mining in protected area is a threat to conservation of the desert and its living organisms.  The government should not give out too many prospecting licences, the Topnaar chief cautioned (New Era Oct. 13, 2008) mining uranium does not only possess health hazards but also environmental concerns such as water contamination, one of the serious issues that have not been addressed properly ( New Era April 21, 2005).\\n\\nAll the Namib uranium mines will bring ore to the surface, crush it, extract the valuable uranium and return the waste to the ground as rock piles or tailings dams or in-filled pits. A common denominator in all these operations is dust. Tons and tons of it – liberated at the surface and exposed to the desert winds. We all know that strong Namib winds pickup and carry dust over hundreds of kilometers, and some of this will blow over towns such as [[Swakopmund]], [[Arandis]] and [[Walvis Bay]]. How significant is this problem? It is difficult to tell, as the uranium mineral car notate can be found naturally on the surface of the gravel plains at Trek kopje, so we should not be surprised to find some of that material in the air.  \\n\\nThe activities that are being done at park is experiencing environmental effects from uranium prospecting and possibly in the future mining and what will happen to the tourism industry in the Namib when mining activities takes place ? Tourists will not want to visit the areas that are near mines or prospecting because of the visual scars on the landscape, noise and dust pollution.  Sensitive desert plants are being destroyed.  The levels of dust, itself being a problem, as well as the radioactive particles that it might carry, will be elevated by all this mining activity. Groundwater contamination Rössing is proud to proclaim that it has adequate measures in place to detect and prevent any spillage or leakage.\\n\\n'''Minimizing the risks'''\\n\\nThese five aspects reflect the biggest changes that could be inflicted upon us. Irrespective of how much you may want to keep Swakopmund or the Namib ‘as you knew it before’, it is going to be changed by uranium mining, so we should get used to the idea and make a positive contribution to the changes. One way could be to motivate for, and get involved in, a strategic planning exercise which spells out the various scenarios and provides options for how to guide or plan those scenarios better. For example, we might consider a zoning exercise in which certain high-value areas (for biodiversity, tourism or wilderness) would be forbidden for mining, as has been done in the Sperrgebiet. Certain areas and routes, already heavily disturbed, could be ear marked as the future desalination foci and the corridors for pipelines power lines that would serve the region at large. Social growth scenarios could be planned, including the growing need for domestic water, waste management and health services. Environmental monitoring stations could be set up to record possible pollutants and health statistics for the region as a whole could provide indicators of the effectiveness of radiation safety precautions.\\n \\n[[Uranium mining]] can be an economically and environmental accepted method for extracting uranium. Environmental impact in uranium mining has also advantages of such as lower capital and operating costs which required much smaller workforce, and the limited environmental impact as no waste lock, no tailing, and lower consumption of water.  One’s long-held impression of mines may be that they profess to bring great economic benefit to a country, yet deep down they are unconcerned with the environmental damage they inflict. Early indications, from the thoroughness of their EIAs, are that they operate on principles of transparency and responsibility to our natural and social environment. The proof of their commitment to make a net positive impact to this country will be seen in how effectively they prevent environmental damage arising from their cumulative activities. \\n\\nUser: Shikomba 21037319 | Shikomba 21037319 ([[User talk: Shikomba #top|talk]] ) 13:25, 16 May 2012 (UTC)\\n\\n== References ==\\n* Environmental Evaluation Associates of Namibia by: John Pallet\\n* Barnard Phoebe (ed) 1998 Biological Diversity of Namibia\\n* Uranium mining in Namibia” The mystery behind low level radiation by: H Shindondola-Mote\\n* Guidebook on Environmental impact Assessment for in Situ leach mining project (IAEA-TECDOC- 1428)\\n* Namibian Newspaper: uranium mining versus tourism, biodervisty by: Ndeshi Shiviya and Michelle Fourier (19 March 2012)\\n\\n\\n[[Wikipedia:School and university projects/Polytechnic of Namibia]]\\n\\n~~Liina K.

21st Century Network was set up to discuss some of the great issues of our millennium and bring back the hope that we can do something about it. This is a group for those who believe that we need to develop a new form of humanism that includes people of all religions and none but who embrace humanistic values as the basis of their actions. These are values of global compassion, personal self-discovery, shared development, planetary concern and a love of community. One commentator states,\\n\\n"I think this group has the potential to make a very important contribution on a number of global challenges that are and will affect our lives in the future. By inviting members of the public, NGO practicioners, policy makers and government representatives to these meetings the group could become an important think tank on a number of issues fostering important linkages between the state and civil society in Britain and beyond. Join this group and be part of this process."
== Introduction ==\\nWith snow avalanches, there is little that it will not take with it. Rocks, soil, trees, ice and the debris of anything that gets in its way. Avalanches interrupt transportation, destroy buildings, pylons and transmission towers and can ruin the reputation and economy of otherwise desirable settlements. The economic cost of prevention and reaction to all these impacts is considerable, but more importantly the human cost is often high and many people are injured or killed in avalanche related accidents every year.\\n\\nOne of the largest avalanche disasters in recent history occurred in February 1999 when a single avalanche in [[Galtur_Avalanche | Galtür]] cost thirty-eight people their lives (Thompson 1999). The heavily populated mountain ranges of Europe are often where the effects of avalanches are most serious. In the Alps approximately 120 people are killed every year. In some years the death toll is even higher. For example, in 1951, 98 people were killed in Switzerland and, in 1954, 143 people were killed in Austria alone (McClung and Schaerer 1993). Little was known about the physics of avalanches or how to predict them back then in the fifties so these disasters were very difficult to forecast. Fifty million people now go skiing every year (Holdsworth 1998) so it is clear that we need to know when avalanches are going to occur so we can act proactively and save lives and money rather than waiting for the avalanches to happen and then act. \\n\\nTo know when an avalanche may happen we need to know under what conditions they are likely to occur and which of these conditions are most important. Once these conditions are known, processes can be set up to judge whether or not an avalanche is likely. This is the science of avalanche forecasting, a science in which there are no second chances. An unforeseen avalanche could result in loss of life, disruption and high clean up and repair costs; whereas almost as seriously, a false alarm may result in unnecessary panic and evacuation. The net result of both these occurrences being loss of faith in the forecaster and in the science as a whole. If people do not trust the warnings or assurances of an avalanche forecaster they become ineffective no matter how accurate they are next time. Williams (1980) states that to be effective, an Avalanche warning program must inspire public confidence. It is therefore in everyone’s interest for the processes involved in avalanche forecasting to be a fool–proof and trustworthy as possible.\\n\\nAccording to LaChapelle (1977), avalanche forecasting has been done ever since human beings first began to live on mountains, even by resorting to witchcraft, he suggests. Since the 1950s methods of avalanche forecasting have become more scientific, although depending on empirical experience and intuition. Recent work has concentrated on the use of computers and models with some exceptions, notably Professor Dent of Montana State University who places an observation hut in the path of an artificially induced avalanche. From there he can make close observations of the way the snow travels and the velocities, densities and pressures thus involved; in the hope of learning more about how an avalanche is initiated. He hopes to develop new models and tools to remove the educated guesswork, replacing it with ‘hard science’ (Dent in Holdsworth 1998). The Swiss Snow and Avalanche Institute has recently initiated similar research led by Dr. Issler. Some of their findings were critical in solving the mystery of the catastrophic and unexpected Galtür avalanche in February 1999. Before these scientists braved real avalanches, studies relied upon the simulation of avalanches using powdered glass in water tanks (Thompson 1999, Hopfinger et al 1977).\\n\\n== Field Methods ==\\n\\n== Computer Models ==\\n\\n== References ==\\nArmstrong, R.L. 1977. ‘Continuos Monitoring of Metamorphic Changes of Internal Snow Structure as a Tool in Avalanche Studies.’ Journal of Glaciology, 19, pp 325 – 334.\\nBolognesi, R., Buser, O and Good, W. 1994. ‘Local Avalanche Forecasting in Swizerland: Strategy and Tools.

'''OPEN INNOVATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY'''\\n\\n    Open Innovation is a new strategy which many industries, corporate houses and the like are applying in order to commercialize their internal IP (intellectual property) and to obtain a huge plethora of external innovations in order to commercialize them as well. In this approach, firms work and interact with external partners and create newer and better technologies and products and thereby benefitting from this interaction. In other words Open Innovation is also known as Commons based Peer Production. This term was coined by Harvard Law School Professor Yochai Benkler to portray a new model of economic production, in which the resourceful energy of a large number of people is coordinated with the aid of internet into projects without the usual hierarchical organization. Open Innovation actually means connecting external and internal ideas/technologies.\\n\\n    The basic premise of Open Innovation is: Keep your valuable proprietary to yourself and leave everything else to external innovation. Innovation is less about inventing new or building new things and more about coordinating good ideas for commercialization.
Bank robbery is the crime of stealing from a bank. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, robbery is, "the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear."[1] By contrast, burglary is defined as, "unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft."[2] Definitions vary in other countries, however. In the United Kingdom, robbery is the removal or taking away of property from a place in which you are entitled to be (without any requirement for force or violence to be threatened or used)[dubious – discuss], whilst burglary is largely in line with the US version, entering property unlawfully. In layman's terms, therefore, bank robbery is entering a bank when it is open and either by using force or the threat of force or otherwise obtaining valuables, usually money. Entering a bank when it is closed is burglary.\\n\\nBank robbery is a predominantly urban crime, taking place most frequently in cities and large towns. The share of bank robberies in small towns increased from about 20% in 1996 to about one third in 2002[citation needed], but the majority of bank robberies are concentrated in urban areas. This concentration is often attributed to there being more branches in urban areas, but the number of bank robberies is disproportionately higher than the number of branches. In Canada, for example, seven cities have 30 percent of all bank branches but 66 percent of all bank robberies; in the United Kingdom, London has 10 percent of the nation's branches but 39 percent of its bank robberies.\\n\\nThis has advantages both for bank robbers and for the law enforcement community. Being in urban areas the transportation infrastructure is more highly developed, especially where banks tend to cluster near to retail shopping areas and commercial districts. Such banks are highly profitable targets for bank robbers who are then afforded a number of potential escape routes. The law enforcement community benefit by being able to respond more quickly and the likelihood of catching a bank robber on or near the scene is higher than for other types of crime. This is because most bank robberies are reported very quickly, frequently while the crime is in progress, most bank robberies occur during daylight hours, have multiple witnesses and with modern technology often produce photographic images that can be distributed and used immediately to canvass the local area. Consequently, many robbers are caught the same day. In fact, the clearance rate for bank robbery is among the highest of all crimes, almost 60 percent.\\n\\nThe urban location of the crime also contributes to its repeat victimization profile, a measure of how quickly a crime victim will suffer a repeat of the original crime. One study carried out by the Home Office found that in England, one third of banks at which a robbery has occurred will be robbed again within three months, while the same study found that in Tallahassee, Florida, one quarter of robbed banks will suffer repeat robbery within a week, and over half of robbed banks will be robbed again within a month. [3]\\n\\nThe Australian Institute of Criminology analyzed trends in bank robbery over a four year period. Of the 808 bank robbery incidents between January 1998 and May 2002 in which the number of offenders involved in the hold-up was recorded, more than half (55 percent) were committed by lone offenders, about 25 percent by pairs, and around 20 percent by three or more robbers. Unarmed lone offenders accounted for the majority of all robberies (28 percent of all robberies), caused the least number of injuries to victims (one percent of all victims' injuries), were the type of robber who most often used a note to threaten bank staff (46 percent of all their robberies), and failed most often in their robbery attempts (33 percent of their robberies). Unarmed gangs inflicted the most injuries to victims (51 percent of all victim injuries) and failed the least in their robbery attempts (six percent of their robberies). Armed robbers used a disguise more often compared to unarmed robbers, with armed pairs employing disguises most often (59 percent of their robberies).[4]\\n\\nA 2005 study by Pastore and Maguire found that injuries occur in about two percent of bank robberies in the US, and about six percent of robberies in Australia, and that a death occurs in approximately one third of all bank robberies.[5]\\n\\nViolent takeover type bank robberies do occur, but are very rare. The majority of bank robberies taking place today are so called "note jobs." These are usually accomplished by simply passing a written note to the teller demanding money. The idea is to attract as little attention as possible. In most cases, other customers present in the bank during such a robbery are completely unaware of what is occurring. Standard bank policy is to avoid violence as much as possible, so they will normally hand over the money and try to adhere to the robber's demands. The robber usually makes away with cash, but typically in relatively small amounts.\\nContents\\n[hide]\\n\\n    * 1 History\\n          o 1.1 Historical Bank Robbers\\n    * 2 Prevention\\n    * 3 See also\\n    * 4 References\\n    * 5 External links\\n\\n[edit] History\\nBurglars Tools Found in the Bank, printed in 1875 in the Canadian Illustrated News\\n\\nAccording to the Independence Hall Association in Philadelphia, the first bank robbery in America happened during the night of August 31 or the early morning of September 1, 1798 at the Bank of Pennsylvania at Carpenters' Hall. The vaults were apparently robbed of $162,821, or approximately $1.8 million in 2006 dollars. Because no forced entry evidence existed, authorities assumed it was an "inside" job. Several suspects were immediately imprisoned and prosecuted, but the culprits eventually charged were a man, Isaac Davis, and a partner. Within days of the heist, Davis' partner fell victim to a plague of yellow fever that ravaged Philadelphia that summer.\\n\\nDuring the American Civil War, raiders from both Union and Confederate armies robbed banks in enemy-controlled towns. These robberies were at the time regarded as legitimate acts of war, but many of the raiders carried on robbing banks in the post-war era, giving rise to the famous robber gangs of the late 19th century.\\n\\n[edit] Historical Bank Robbers\\n\\nIn the early twentieth century Willie Sutton was asked why he robbed banks and he was famously reported as answering "Because that's where the money is." This is, in fact, a quote invented by the interviewer to make the story more interesting.[6] Another famous bank robber was John Dillinger, who committed bank robbery crimes in mid-western America. Some considered him a dangerous criminal, while others idolized him as a supposed present-day Robin Hood. He gained this latter reputation (and the nickname "Jackrabbit") for his graceful movements during bank heists, such as leaping over the counter (a movement he supposedly copied from the movies) and many narrow getaways from police. On July 22, 1934 in Chicago, Illinois, Dillinger was cornered by FBI agents in an alley outside of a movie theater, drew a pistol against them, and died at that location of gunshot wounds.\\n\\n[edit] Prevention\\n\\nBanks have implemented modern security measures, like motion-sensing and high resolution color security cameras, time-locked heavy vault doors, silent alarms, exploding dye packs, bait money and locator devices. Some banks supplement this protection with armed or unarmed security guards. [7]\\n\\nGone are the days when expert safe crackers could crack the code to a vault or safe. Today's biometric technology makes non-violent methods of gaining access nearly impossible. Modern vaults and safes are also reinforced to the point that the amount of explosives needed to blow them open would likely create unwanted attention and possible even cause the building to collapse. Even the most impregnable vault or safe needs to be able to be opened by someone. To circumvent vault and safe security features, robbers often kidnap the bank manager, but that is not always a successful workaround as banks have often removed the manager's ability to open the vault. Kidnapping also enables the police to lay more charges and thus more jail time for the robbers should they get caught.\\n\\nThe police have new measures at their disposal to catch robbers, such as well-armed SWAT teams, and pursuit cars (often a high-powered vehicle) driven by a trained driver that is capable of keeping pace with getaway cars. Forensic identification techniques have also improved greatly; should a bank robber fire a gun, the police can trace the bullet to the exact firearm using ballistic fingerprinting. Martin Kemp, in a BBC documentary, once inquired on the effectiveness of an Uzi in a bank robbery, to which the firearms training instructor joked "that would be thirty pieces of evidence to convict you." The sawed-off shotgun, a common robbery weapon in United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand where handguns are difficult to obtain, are easily concealable but not particularly effective.\\n\\nWhile it is likely but not certain that the first time someone robs a bank they will not be caught, it is highly likely that if they continue they will be caught. Few criminals are able to make a successful living out of bank robbery over the long run, since each attempt increases the probability that they will be identified and caught. Bank robberies are still fairly common and are indeed successful, although eventually many bank robbers are found and arrested. A report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation[8] states that, among Category I serious crimes, the arrest rate for bank robbery in 2001 was second only to that of murder. Today most organized crime groups tend to make their money by other means, such as drug trafficking, gambling, loan sharking, identity theft, or online scamming and phishing.\\n\\nA further factor making bank robbery unattractive for criminals in the United States is the severity with which it is prosecuted. Accounts at all US banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a corporation of the federal government, bringing bank robbery under federal jurisdiction and involving the FBI. United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines for bank robbery mandate long prison terms, which are usually further enhanced by the use or carrying of loaded firearms, prior criminal convictions, and the absence of parole from the federal prison system. As with any type of robbery, the fact that bank robbery is also inherently a violent crime typically causes corrections administrators to place imprisoned bank robbers in harsher high-security institutions.\\n\\n[edit] See also\\n\\n    * List of famous bank robbers and robberies\\n    * Convenience store crime\\n\\n[edit] References\\n\\n   1. ^ FBI definition of Bank Robbery\\n   2. ^ FBI definition of Burglary\\n   3. ^ Home Office study\\n   4. ^ Australian Institute of Criminology\\n   5. ^ Pastore and Maguire\\n   6. ^ Willie Sutton\\n   7. ^ Design of a GPS/GSM currency tracker device\\n   8. ^ Bank Robbery in the United States\\n\\n[edit] External links\\n\\n    * Armed Robbery Training Manuals and Training for sale\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2003\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2004\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2005\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2006\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2007 Q1\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2007 Q2\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2007 Q3\\n    * FBI Bank Crime Statistics 2007 Q4\\n\\nRetrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_robbery"\\nCategories: Bank robberies | Bank robbers\\nHidden categories: Cleanup from July 2007 | All pages needing cleanup | Articles with limited geographic scope | Articles with disputed statements from June 2009 | All articles with unsourced statements | Articles with unsourced statements from April 2009\\nViews\\n\\n    * Article\\n    * Discussion\\n    * Edit this page\\n    * History\\n    * Watch\\n\\nPersonal tools\\n\\n    * Try Beta\\n    * VERY2PACKING00\\n    * My talk\\n    * My preferences\\n    * My watchlist\\n    * My contributions\\n    * Log out\\n\\nNavigation\\n\\n    * Main page\\n    * Contents\\n    * Featured content\\n    * Current events\\n    * Random article\\n\\nSearch\\n \\nInteraction\\n\\n    * About Wikipedia\\n    * Community portal\\n    * Recent changes\\n    * Contact Wikipedia\\n    * Donate to Wikipedia\\n    * Help\\n\\nToolbox\\n\\n    * What links here\\n    * Related changes\\n    * Upload file\\n    * Special pages\\n    * Printable version\\n    * Permanent link\\n    * Cite this page\\n    * PDF version\\n\\nCreate a book\\n\\n    * Add page to book\\n    * Books help\\n\\nLanguages\\n\\n    * Cymraeg\\n    * Deutsch\\n    * Español\\n    * Nederlands\\n    * 日本語\\n    * Svenska\\n    * ไทย\\n\\nPowered by MediaWiki\\nWikimedia Foundation\\n\\n    * This page was last modified on 12 August 2009 at 05:54.\\n    * Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License; additional terms may apply.

VIRUS IDENTIFICATION: A CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIVIRAL THERAPY\\nBiswendu B. Goswami, Ph.D.\\nUnited States Food and Drug Administration (Retired)\\nCurrent Address: 7624 Epsilon Drive, Derwood, MD 20855\\nTel:301-990-6940; \\nAbstract:\\nThe necessity for rapid methods of virus identification arose from the fact that human diseases caused by food-borne viruses range from infectious hepatitis to acute gastroenteritis. The viral causative agents run the gamut from simple single stranded RNA viruses (hepatitis A or infectious hepatitis), to more complex double stranded RNA viruses such as rotavirus and large single stranded RNA viruses such as corona virus. To complicate matters further, each of these virus species have dozens of genotypes ( each genome differing from the prototype by a few to hundreds of nucleotides, depending on the size of the genome. The number of human infections reported each year has made these viruses a major public health problem in the USA in recent years. Food-borne viruses have been associated with high morbidity and some mortality. Currently, other than disinfection guidelines, there are no effective control measures available for public health agencies to intervene in a meaningful way to reduce the incidence of food-borne infections. Viruses can be detected in both stool and vomitus, and the usual route of spread is via person to person. With the availability of more sensitive molecular diagnostics, increasingly outbreaks are reported where the initial source of the infection is contaminated food or water. For FDA (Food and Drug Administration), CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and ORA (Office of Regulatory Affairs), detection of the virus in clinical samples and contaminated food or water is essential to develop meaningful policies for control and prevention.\\nKeywords: Virus Identification; Microarray; Sequence independent target synthesis\\n2\\nIntroduction:\\nProcedures for virus identification is going through a revolution due to two recent developments. The orthodox methods for virus identification by cell culture followed by secondary confirmation by immunological or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques were too slow and labor intensive. PCR based methods have the added disadvantages they are extremely sensitive to impurities in the test material, and have very narrow specificity, requiring individual tests for each virus, and confirmation by sequencing is frequently a necessity to distinguish viral genotypes and sub-genotypes in a species..\\nMicroarray hybridization based techniques for the identification of known mutations in specific areas of viral genomes initially were successfully performed by synthesizing oligodeoxy nucleotide probes based on the sequence of wild-type and mutated viral genomes. The probes (individually synthesized) were then immobilized on solid supports by hand spotting, and later by automated programmable applicators that could handle several hundred probes [1] - [9]. An alternative to the traditional dye termination method of sequencing nucleic acids based on hybridization to oligonucleotide probes on solid support was developed in the 1990s [10]- [13].. However, the true potential for identification of viruses on a massive scale based on sequence of viral genomes did not take off until the development of in situ probe synthesis and immobilization techniques by [11] [14] ;[15]. These newer photolithographic techniques allowed for the synthesis and simultaneous immobilization of hundreds of thousands of probes in a single microarray allowing re-sequencing on a large scale by hybridization to identify virus genotypes. Wong et al., [16]Genome Res. 2007 or 2004?) used such an\\n3\\narray incorporating more than 383,000 probes to sequence the entire 29.7 kb genome of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (coronavirus). Since then, microarrays have been developed that can incorporate over two million probes , This development opened up the possibility of identifying multiple virus species and genotypes in a single experiment. However, to realize this potential, it is necessary to have a target synthesis method that is independent of the sequence of the viruses present in the test material.\\nThe new microarray based method developed in my laboratory at Food and Drug Administration (FDA), avoids PCR amplification with virus specific primers normally used for target synthesis in microarray experiments. However, it must be realized that PCR increases the number of specic targets by millions of folds, that makes very sensitive virus detection possible, As can be imagined, such sensitive detection is not possible without a means of target or signal amplification. This disadvantage in sensitivity is somewhat mitigated by the ability to amplify the signal produced by hybridization using biotin labeling of targets follwed by immunological detection of the biotin by Cy3 labeled streptavidin due to its strong affinity to biotin. A further signal amplification is possible by a second round of reaction with streptavidin foloowed by reaction with Cy3 labeled strptavidin. [17 ]. Detection and identification of any viral sequence is thus possible within this limitations, as,long as it’s sequence is represented in the array [17; 18;19]. Sensitivity may be further improved using modifications such as anti-sense RNA (aRNA) amplification.\\nConsidering the number of viral diseases extant in the world today, only a few of them are controllable by prophylactic use of vaccines. The ease with which viruses\\n4\\ndevelop resistance to vaccines is another major concern. Emergence of resistance viruses is difficult to detect by orthodox methods of cell culture, or even by conventional PCR. As an example , we can cite the experience in many third world countries , which at one time were considered free of poliovirus, but are now experiencing reemergence of this scourge, mainly due to the use of attenuated virus strains for vaccination, which then circulate within the population mainly through fecal contamination [5; 6]. This recirculation allows the virus to undergo multiple rounds of replication raising the possibility of mutations in the genome. A single or a handful of mutations in the genome gives rise to a resistance strain. It is not difficult to imagine a situation when other viruses now effectively controlled by vaccination will develop resistance to existing vaccines. The flu virus is a prime example. New Flu vaccines are needed to be developed almost every year due to development of resistance due to genome mutation [].\\nAn even more dangerous and potentially disastrous trend is developing in the United States where a false correlation between Thermosal , a mercury based preservative used in vaccines and Autism has been widely publicized. As a result, many parents now believe that it is preferable not to vaccinate the children to prevent development of Autism, and leave them exposed to risks of diseases such as polio and mumps. The faulty initial report has since been rescinded, but a potentially very dangerous movement has taken root.\\nFood-borne viruses have been recognized as a major challenge to public health for a number of years. Historically, paralytic poliomyelitis transmitted mainly by unpasteurized milk was an eye opener to public health agencies including FDA to the connection between unsafe foods and human health. The introduction of pasteurization\\n5\\nand subsequently the development of polio vaccines, and a national program for polio vaccination have made polio a thing of the past. Recently however, other food-borne viral illnesses have emerged to threaten the health and safety of a public that have become increasingly complacent due to the increased bacterial surveillance and implementation of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) throughout United States and Europe. Fortunately, it is much easier to detect bacteria in foods. Bacteria grow in simple media, which can then be identified by multiple methods [17, 20]. Despite this, frequent localized epidemics of E.coli and Salmonella from contaminated foods such as meat and vegetables are frequently reported. Virus detection in foods is much more difficult, because unlike bacteria they are obligatory intracellular parasites, and can only be grown with difficulty in cultured animal cell lines [1,2,3,5,7,9,16]. The time factor is of critical importance, and detection can only be achieved by extremely sensitive molecular methods such as PCR. More recently, attempts are being made to use the microarray techniques for virus detection [7; 9 21; 22; 23; 24; 25; 26; 27; 28]. Unfortunately, both types of methods are prone to false negative results, particularly when applied to food matrices. Laboratories are reluctant to invest in equipment and trained personnel because the success rate is so low. The success rate of virus detection is fairly high in body fluids and feces, because these sources have relatively high levels of virus contamination [5; 6; 16; 21; 22; 29; 30; 31. The success rate at FDA and other laboratories in virus detection in foods is very low as noted above, because we had to deal with foods, where contamination levels are naturally low. Moreover, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have the added advantage of hindsight [32]. They test specimens only from patients with overt signs of disease. But once a disease outbreak has occurred in a\\n6\\npopulation, control measures by the CDC are totally inadequate. Vaccines available are effective only prophylactically to prevent further spread of the disease among the non-infected population. Not knowing what food caused the disease outbreak, FDA is unable to advise the population to avoid certain types of food except in very general terms. Recommendations concerning the cleaning of food prior to cooking and consumption, also is hardly effective..\\nMost food-borne viruses have RNA genomes, with minimal viral functions necessary for virus propagation. As a result, development of chemical therapeutic agents has been very slow, with only a handful of agents such as Ribavirin [33] and a few other nucleoside analogs such as Xyloadenosine (XyloA) showing potential to be effective against certain viruses [34; 35; 36]. Interferon induced 2’-5’ linked oligoadenosine (2-5A) and its analogs have not been adequately tested [37; 38; 39]. Additionaly, food-borne RNA viruses are notoriously resistant to inactivation by physical or chemical agents [40; 41 ]. Chief among them in developed countries is norovirus (NV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV).. It is now a recognized fact that NV is the causal agent of most food-borne viral infections in the U.S., while other viruses such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), enteroviruses A and B (HEA and HEB) and rotavirus are also contributors. These illnesses can occur following consumption of contaminated food, person-to-person contact, or food contaminated by infected food handlers, or by contact with water contaminated by treated or untreated sewage [42].\\nA number of factors have compromised FDA’s ability to respond to this new threat by instituting adequate regulatory framework. Projects implemented by FDA have been top-heavy with much more emphasis on sophisticated methods of virus detection, while\\n7\\nthe problem resides in the isolation of low levels of virus from large quantities of suspected foods in a sufficiently pure form to be effectively detected by these ultrasensitive techniques [. We will address this gap in our ability to provide an underpinning of laboratory science by investigating new detection technologies that will allow FDA and other regulatory agencies such as CDC to respond to food-borne virus infections by identifying the viral agent, determining the source, and the relatedness and extent of such outbreaks, when discussing specific results [24;27]\\nMaterials and Methods\\nThe paradigm of virus detection technologies currently available is inadequate in several respects. The technology is mainly based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based amplification of viral nucleic acids. Since most food-borne viruses have an RNA genome, a process called reverse transcription (RT) to first transcribe viral RNA to cDNA is appended to the PCR procedure (called RT-PCR). This technology is two decades old [43] , although the application of this technology for virus detection in foods is more recent [24;27; 28;29;30; 31]. Several important modifications to the basic RT-PCR have been instituted, such as multiplex PCR [30], competitive PCR [32], real time PCR [23] ,which have increased the sensitivity of virus detection and reduced the time needed to obtain results. The major disadvantage of (real-time) RT-PCR for detection of an unknown virus is the specificity of most of these assays. For example, during an outbreak investigation samples will be screened for an etiologic agent that best matches the clinical symptoms when evaluable (norovirus and rotavirus for acute gastroenteritis and HAV for hepatitis) which may delay reporting if an unexpected etiologic agent is causing the outbreak [33]..\\n8\\nTo develop new high density oligonucleotide microarray methods with broad specificity for the sensitive detection and typing of foodborne viruses, these methods will have to be able to i) detect which virus is present, ii) the genogroup and genotype and if needed sub-genotype of the virus. This information could then be used to alert the regulatory agencies on the emergence of new virus strains which is currently not possible without sequencing multiple PCR products. Such detection processes will not be dependent on PCR amplification. Therefore, no prior knowledge of the nature of the virus or its genome sequence will be necessary. The same analyte will be used in a single experiment to obtain all the information needed to identify multiple viruses in the same sample. The high density oligonucleotide microarray based procedure has been used in combination with PCR amplification to study the evolution of the SARS coronavirus ([ 16], and bacterial genomes [20;17] as well as for the detection of mutations in the poliovirus genome ([6] . We have identified different types of HAV and HEA and HEB (more commonly known as coxsackieviruses A and B) viruses as well as studied the evolution of the wild type HAV genome HM175 to a cytopathic variant HM175/18f using a high density (> than 13,000 probes) microarray to detect the nucleotide changes accompanying this phenotypic change [18].\\nAdvances in microarray technology have allowed the identification of genetic variability over very long stretches of DNA in bacterial genomes [17; 20]. These newly developed high density microarrays contain thousands to hundreds of thousands of oligonucleotide probes, instead of a few dozen as used for detection of mutations in poliovirus genome during evolution from a vaccine strain to paralytic poliomyelitis strain [ 6 ; 5] in a single array thereby expanding the power of identification.\\n9\\nIsolation and labeling of Viral RNA. Viral RNA from HAV and CXKV strains were purified from 140 μl of virus cell culture supernatant with a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For norovirus samples, a 10% (wt/vol) stool suspension was prepared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 20 minutes. RNA was extracted from 140 μl to 280 μl of the supernatant with QIAamp viral RNA mini kit. The RNA samples were eluted in 50 μl of elution buffer and stored at -80 ºC until used. Reverse transcription was performed for one cycle (42 °C, 60 min) using random hexamer primers (Invitrogen, CA) followed by 15 min at 70 °C. This is essentially the initial step in current RT-PCR protocols. Reverse transcriptase requires a primer DNA or RNA) with a free 3’OH group hybridized to a template (DNA or RNA) to initiate cDNA synthesis. Viral RNAs that do not have a poly (A) sequence at their 3’end (such as rotavirus genomic RNA) cannot be primed by oligo (dT)15 and are primed by random hexamers. Resulting cDNA was fragmented with DNase I (Invitrogen, CA) at 37 °C for 1 min. Fragmented cDNA was labeled with Terminal Transferase (Invitrogen, CA) in the presence of biotin-11-ddATP (PerkinElmer, MA) at 37 °C for 4 hrs so that the fragmentwd cDNA is extended by a single nucleotide, which does not change its hybridization characteristis to the probes in the array..\\nThe biotin labeled synthesized targets are then hybridized to the probes on the microarray. Following a series of washes, the hybridized targets are reacted with Cy3 labeled streptavidin. After further washes to remove unreacted Cy3 coupled strptavidin, hybridized targets are detected by Cy3 fluorescence by scanning the array.\\n10\\nA typical result is shown in Fig.1... Computer analysis of the signal by software developed for this purpose is used to identify the virus species, genogroup and the strain within the genogroup.\\nMicroarray Hybridization, Scanning, and Data Analysis. Microarray hybridization was performed using the Affymetrix protocol. Briefly, Biotinylated cDNA in the presence of Affymetrix hybridization buffer was hybridized to the microarray chip in a total volume of 120 μl. Before application to the array, the samples were heated to 98 °C for 1 min, cooled at 45 °C for another 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 5 min. The microarray chip was then incubated at 45 °C for 16 hrs in a hybridization oven. Following hybridization, the wash and stain procedures were carried out by the Fluidics station (Affymetrix, CA). All arrays were imaged by using Affymetrix microarray scanner at a resolution of 10 μm per pixel. Signal intensity of the hybridization was extracted by using Affymetrix power tools, and the subsequent data analysis was performed using MS Excel. For each viral genome represented on the array, the average signal intensity for all the probes within that genome was determined. The average intensity is first determined as described by Jackson et al. (16), and Ayodeji et al. (17). Each average genome intensity was then normalized by the average intensity of all the probes represented on the array. To minimize effects of nonspecific hybridization, an empirical cutoff value of 3 was considered as a threshold value for a positive signal. Microarray hybridization data were then converted to color visualization schemes in which hybridization signal intensity is reflected by the color scale of vertical strips.\\nMicroarray design:\\n11\\nAll microarrays used in this study were customer ordered to be fabricated by Affymetrix Inc. (Santa Clara, CA) using a maskless array synthesis technology (Singh-Gasson et al., 1999; Nuwaysir et al., 2002. The tiling microarray contained 25-mer oligonucleotide probes which were designed to detect common food-borne viruses including hepatitis A virus, norovirus, coxsackievirus, rotavirus, hepatitis E virus, and astrovirus as well as saporovirus. All viral genetic sequence data were obtained from database of viral genomes from Genbank. The chips were composed of overlapping 25-mer oligonucleotides which covered 3,000 bp sequences from 5’ end viral genomes of each virus. Each sequence of interest was tiled with the 25-mer probes with 2-bp spacing. The microarray representation of common foodborne viruses are listed in Tables. 1 to 6 along with specific hybridization signal intensities that reflect relatedness of virus strains within the same species..\\nThe design of the microarray follows closely the protocol we have recently described ([39]Ayodeji et al. 2009; Chen at al. [41}). However, instead of 13,000 probes, these arrays each contain 100,000 probes covering every complete and partial sequences available in the database for NoV, HAV, HEA, HEB and RV. We also developed probes covering the entire sequence of several individual viral genome sequences. . Probes are designed to have a 2 base overlap i.e., each probe starts at the 2nd nucleotide of every sequence, thereby covering a 7.5kb genome with about 1500 probes. 7.5 kb is the average size of the RNA genome of a common food-borne virus except rotavirus that has a segmented double stranded RNA genome, where each segment RNA is 1.5 to 2kbp long. Alternatively, the 5 base overlap between consecutive probes may be reduced to increase the number of probes to cover the same sequence Since the capacity of the\\n12\\nmicroarrays (up to 2 million probes) far exceeds the number of probes in our current array design (100,000), we could incorporate probes covering more viruses, although not all virus groups were tested for this study. However, these served the purpose of negative controls to show that false positives were not seen. For target synthesis for these experiments, we have investigated whether viral targets can be obtained in sufficient quantities in a sequence non-specific manner to hybridize to a high density microarray containing greater than 100,000 probes representing all the known sequences (partial or complete) of the major foodborne viruses (NV, HAV, HEA, HEB and rotaviruses) and identify the viral strain (or strains) present in a sample.\\nRESULTS\\nTables1to 6 show the lists the selected enteric viruses and the number of probes for each strain of virus that were synthesized directly on the FDA_EVIR microarray by photolithography whereby the total number of probes on the array is 91542. Selected regions of several enteric viruses’ genomes were tiled at two nucleotide spacing. Each probe is 25 nucleotides long and there is a 23 base-pair overlap between consecutive probes for the same virus genotype; therefore, the complete array covers 183,084 nucleotides of viral genomic sequence. The probe numbers we used for each strain of HAV for the sequence coverage of several HAV strains belonging to HAV genogroups I to III are shown in Table 1.. But no attempt was made to include all the partial sequences that exist in the database., although we included some of the VP1-2 and VP3 regions, that are reported to contain maximum sequence conservation.\\n13\\nTable 1.

Although cross-hybridization within different genotype strains in HAV genus occurred, this was expected due to less divergence among genotypes of HAV. Stronger hybridization signal was obtained between specific genotype viral RNA and array elements derived from the same genotypic virus. Based on the hybridization pattern and the sequence information of the probes, it is clearly possible to detect and type HAV.\\nOur results indicate that the microarray hybridization technique can be applied to the identification of different viruses present in a sample and detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) to identify closely related viral strains belonging to the same species [35](Ayodeji et al. 2009). However, the current protocols for SARS virus ([16]Wong et al., 2004), poliovirus ([5]Cherkasova et al., 2003; [6]Laassri et al., 2005),\\n17\\nand rotavirus ([38]Honma et al., 2007; [3]Chizhikov, et al., 2002), still depend on RT-PCR for target synthesis to be used in hybridization experiments. Using virus-specific RT-PCR assays requires prior knowledge of the virus to be expected in the sample hence potentially missing other viral disease agents that may be present in the sample but go undetected. Since current microarray allow of the use of up to 2 million probes in a single array, the potential for the detection and identification of many viral disease agents in a single experiment is not fully realized.\\nIn our laboratory, we have investigated whether viral targets can be obtained in sufficient quantities in a sequence non-specific manner to hybridize to a high density microarray containing greater than 100,000 probes representing all the known sequences (partial or complete) of the major foodborne viruses (NV, HAV, HEA, HEB and rotaviruses) and identify the viral strain (or strains) present in a sample. Synthesis of cDNA in a non-sequence specific manner was accomplished by reverse transcription of viral RNA using a mixture of random hexamers or olig(dT)15 to prime cDNA synthesis using viral RNA as template by AMV reverse transcriptase. This is essentially the initial step in current RT-PCR protocols. Reverse transcriptase requires a primer DNA or RNA) with a free 3’OH group hybridized to a template (DNA or RNA) to initiate cDNA synthesis. Viral RNAs that do not have a poly (A) sequence at their 3’end (such as rotavirus genomic RNA) cannot be primed by oligo (dT)15 and are primed by random hexamers. We then label the cDNA (see below for details). The synthesized targets are then hybridized to the probes on the microarray and the array scanned for hybridization signal (see Fig.1). Computer analysis of the signal by software developed for this\\n18\\npurpose is used to identify the virus species, genogroup and the strain within the genogroup.\\nSimaltaneous Detection of Mulitple HAV Genotypes\\nDetection of Noroviruses.\\nTo access the applicability of the tiling microarray for norovirus identification in a clinical setting, we examined three stool specimens isolated from infected patients.

The samples including noro#1, noroGI and #3263 have been genotyped via quantitative RT-PCR. They all belonged to genogroup I. As anticipated, hybridization to genogroup I-specific norovirus-derived oligoprobes was detected in all three virus samples. No cross-hybridization to noro genogroup II oligoprobes was observed. In sample of GI and #3263, strong hybridization to genogroup I specific sequence L07418 was obtained. In the meantime, hybridization to genogroup I specific sequence DQ340089 was also observed, whose signal was slightly lower than cut-off value. (Fig.2, 3).

A mixture of cDNA derived from the three viruses was hybridized to the microarray chip. As shown in Fig. 5, CXKV B3 displayed a clear-cut hybridization pattern distinguishable from other coxsackieviruses, making it possible to determine the virus serotype; Strong hybridization to the genotype IB oligoprobes was observed in HAV HM-175/18f although cross-hybridization to genotype IA oligoprobes also occurred (Table.6). In all positive hybridization, the average signal intensity ratio of IB-specific oligoprobes was 8.3 while IA was 4.2, which indicated that the array elements are capable of detecting and typing HAV. Good hybridization was observed between #3263 and genogroup I oligoprobes derived from noro1 L07418 sequence with signal intensity ratio of 3.9 (Table.6). Fig 5.

The insert shows close-up view of positively hybridized sequences derived from each virus.\\n23\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe long term objective is to use this technique to identify any viral agent present in the sample without investigator bias. Thus the proposed technological change will reveal a true picture of the viral disease agent and not just the confirmation of a notion based on vague symptoms of a disease. This is particularly important because many of the enteroviruses often show similar disease symptoms. It will also enable us to determine whether multiple strains or virus species are involved in a disease outbreak. Although we deem it unnecessary, the outcome of a microarray detection experiment can be independently verified using the more conventional PCR based amplification and sequencing or a second round of hybridization to a more narrowly focused less complex microarray with fewer probe features. We believe that the strength of the microarray technique is in the redundancy of probes used to interrogate a particular sequence making the technique essentially error-free. Variations in the probe sequences in the form of mutated probe oligonucleotides can be included in the array design to further increase the fidelity of virus identification and confidence in the result.\\nNoroviruses (NoV) and to a lesser extent HAV and human rotavirus (RV) are the most common foodborne viruses. Othe picornaviruses such as human enteric viruses A and B have at least the potential to be transmitted via person to person contact, through infected food handlers and contaminated foods. Current epidemiological studies indicate that NoV is responsible for the vast majority of food borne outbreaks in developed countries. The time frame of gastrointestinal disease caused by NoV is very unique due to the rapid onset of symptoms and easier to spot and a correlation to specific food consumption easier to establish that other viruses such as HEA or HEB or RV. The\\n24\\nsecond most common foodborne virus HAV has a rather long incubation period before disease symptoms become apparent. Epidemiological correlation to any specific food consumption thus is rather difficult to establish.\\nThe detection of food-borne viruses in clinical samples (mainly stool samples from outbreak investigations) is extremely difficult using cell culture due to the inability to grow NV and HAV in cultured cells. Hence molecular methods such as real-time RT-PCR are currently used for the detection of foodborne viruses in clinical samples. The current hypothesis developed from this need to broaden the scope of detection without sacrificing the sensitivity and rapidity of detection and the need to obtain more information from an experiment that is currently possible with RT-PCR.\\nThe strategy behind this proposal is to investigate whether food-borne virus detection and identification based on high density microarray hybridization currently being developed at Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) can be utilized for routine virus detection in FDA and other agencies such as CDC and Office of Regulatory Research (ORA) for the rapid detection and unambiguous identification (genotyping) of these viral disease agents from diverse source materials. Due to time limitation, we will concentrate our efforts on the detection of virus from stool samples from outbreak investigations available from CDC. Currently, outbreak investigations are geared to detecting and broad genogroup identification of the most common food borne virus NV. Due to the relative low frequency of other foodborne viral diseases, these viruses are usually not targeted. However, RNA virus populations are highly heterogeneous even within a particular genogroup, and genogroup identification using PCR primers based on consensus sequences are unable to identify the particular strain within the genogroup.\\n25\\nAnalysis of outbreak strain identification is therefore incomplete, since a particular strain within a genogroup may be responsible for the outbreak being studied. In addition, the narrow focus on a particular species of virus ignores other viruses that are also food-borne and may be present in a particular outbreak, which could have provided valuable information as to the source o[[File:Example.jpg]]f the outbreak.\\nConclusion:\\nWe hypothesize that advanced microarray design that incorporates probes for multiple virus species and strains will be able to provide the needed information to pinpoint the exact strain of the virus responsible for the outbreak, and also provide information as to the presence of other viruses that may be associated with that outbreak.\\nStatistical significance of array hybridization signals is computed using array package software where data points are calculated as signal intensity above normalized background (corrected to internal standards) and converted to average probe intensity (Jackson et al. 2007; Wong et al. 2004). Viral samples in the form of stool samples from outbreak investigations will be provided by CDC (NoV) and CBER (RV). The samples will have been typed by specific RT-PCR based methods prior to coding and then supplied to us for microarray experiments. Any initial negative hybridization will trigger a re-sampling and analysis due to the possibility of sampling error or a negative (no virus) sample. Sampling error rates and percent positive identification (following code breakage) will be used to determine statistical success rate of the microarray analysis. We realize that a sample with very low viral load may produce poor hybridization signal. In that case, the viral RNA will be amplified in a sequence non-specific manner using T7 RNA polymerase to preserve the original distribution.\\n26\\nThe success of our microarray screening protocol depends on target synthesis that is not specific to any particular virus. In our preliminary experiments we have achieved target synthesis for our microarray hybridization experiments by eliminating the PCR step by relying on a highly efficient synthesis and labeling of target. Viral RNA was purified from the all virus containing stool samples with a QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer primers. The resultant cDNA is fragmented by DNase 1 digestion and the mixture of the fragments is labeled with biotin-11-ddATP (PerkinElmer, MA) in the presence of Terminal Transferase (Invitrogen, CA). The use of ddATP assures that only a single nucleotide is added to the 3’end of each cDNA fragments and therefore the hybridization characteristics to the oligo-probes on the array is not altered. For signal amplification at the end of hybridization, the biotin in the target now hybridized to the probe is reacted with cy3 labeled streptavidin. The cy3 is detected by scanning and the scans analyzed for the detection of hybridization to specific probes on the array. An example of a typical result is shown in Fig.1. The applicability of this protocol in detecting a single species of virus is shown in Fig.2. The experiment detected genogroup I of NV, with the two peaks of average intensities identifying two different strains. Significantly, the microarray detected two different strains of group I NV in the same sample. The smaller peak has a 91% sequence identity to the main peak supporting our hypothesis (see above) that outbreak samples may contain multiple NV strains that can only be detected using microarray.\\nThe second hypothesis that we propose to test is that microarray hybridization can detect multiple viruses in the same experiment if the target is synthesized and labeled\\n27\\nusing technology that are not dependent on sequence specific PCR amplification. An example is shown in Fig.5 from a recent experiment carried out in our laboratory. RNA samples from three different viruses HAV (genotype HM175), NoV (Group I) and HEB (strain CVB 3) were separately reverse transcribed and labeled as described above. The labeled cDNAs were mixed in equimolar quantities and hybridized. Analysis of hybridization data show that all three viruses were identified. In addition to the HAV and CV strains, the array experiment again identified two closely related strains of NoV as seen in Fig.2, that could not be distinguished by RT-PCR.\\nExpected Outcomes:\\nExperiments performed in different laboratories that have used microarray technology for virus detection and identification have concluded that the potential benefits of the use of microarrays in diagnostic settings is very high. The ability of the microarray for virus identification is attested by the proliferation of virus species that are being examined using this technology (Wong et al., 2004 for SARS coronavirus, Laasari et al. 2005, for Poliovirus, Honma et al. 2007, Chizikov et al. 2002, for rotavirus, Ryabinin et al. 2006, for orthopox virus, Deregt et al. 2006, for swine fever virus, Ayodeji et al. 2009, for hepatitis A and human enteric viruses A and B. The dependence on RT-PCR for target synthesis however has restricted the realization of the full potential of the microarray for multiple virus identification in a single experiment. We have shown by eliminating the PCR step during target synthesis that NoV, HAV and human enterovirus can be identified in the same analyte (Fig.3). Comparison of hybridization intensities from targets synthesized from two different strains of the same virus species can identify nucleotide changes in the virus genome occurring over time (Wong et al. 2004; Ayodeji et.al.\\n28\\n2009). As shown in Fig.3, perhaps the greatest advantage of this technique is to identify a virus strain in the absence of any prior knowledge of the sequence of the virus in the sample by eliminating the need for PCR. Eliminating the need for PCR does not reduce the sensitivity to the level that the virus can no longer be detected (Fig.3). Conceivably it is possible that such a situation will be encountered in samples with very low viral load. In such cases a sequence non-specific RNA amplification procedure may be used to increase the sensitivity. We have to yet test this hypothesis. The other advantage accruing to the agency will be the ability to identify emerging virus strains which are not detectable due to change of sequence at the PCR primer binding site on the genome, and the need for sequencing every PCR product.\\nCurrently, a vaccine against HAV, the second most prevalent foodborne disease is available for prophylactic use. However, a vaccine against NoV is not available to prevent NoV outbreaks. Even where a vaccine for a particular virus is available, vaccination programs to prevent viral disease outbreaks have to be initiated well in advance of a disease outbreak in order to allow time for the targeted population to develop immunity. Another drawback is that viruses frequently mutate to escape immunity as well as to become resistant to antivirals. The microarray data can be of value to provide indication to health officials if resistance strains are emerging and provide sufficient time to change the strategy for controlling an outbreak.\\nEND END\\n29\\nAcknowledgement:\\nThe author wishes to acknowledge the full financial support of the Food and Drug Administration for the work carried out while he was an employee of the Federal Government of the United States of America.\\nReferences:\\n[1] Verhoef LPB, Kroneman A, van Duynhoven Y, Boshuizen H, van Pelt W, Koopmans M.

Briefly, Biotinylated cDNA in the presence of Affymetrix hybridization buffer was hybridized to the microarray chip in a total volume of 120 μl. Before application to the array, the samples were heated to 98 °C for 1 min, cooled at 45 °C for another 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 5 min. The microarray chip was then incubated at 45 °C for 16 hrs in a hybridization oven. Following hybridization, the wash and stain procedures were carried out by the Fluidics station (Affymetrix, CA). All arrays were imaged by using Affymetrix microarray scanner at a resolution of 10 μm per pixel. Signal intensity of the hybridization was extracted by using Affymetrix power tools, and the subsequent data analysis was performed using MS Excel. For each viral genome represented on the array, the average signal intensity for all the probes within that genome was determined. The average intensity is first determined as described by Jackson et al. (16), and Ayodeji et al. (17). Each average genome intensity was then normalized by the average intensity of all the probes represented on the array. To minimize effects of nonspecific hybridization, an empirical cutoff value of 3 was considered as a threshold value for a positive signal. Microarray hybridization data were then converted to color visualization schemes in which hybridization signal intensity is reflected by the color scale of vertical strips.\\nValidation of Norovirus Microarray Genotyping. To confirm the microarray genotyping result of the norovirus sample #186 (NoV#186), we performed a specific PCR with a published primer set G1SKF (5’-CTGCCCGAATTYGTAAATGA-3’) and G1SKR (5’-CCAACCCARCCATTRTACA-3’); G2SKF (5’-\\n34\\nCNTGGGAGGGCGATCGCAA-3’) and G2SKR (5’-CCRCCNGCATRHCCRTTRTACAT-3’; Y=C/T; N=A/T/G/C; R=A/G; H=A/T/C). This pair of primer was used for the amplification of genogroup I and group II norovirus. (Kojima, S., Kageyama, T., Fukushi, S.,et.al. (2002). Genogroup-specific PCR primers for detection of nowalk-like viruses. J Virol Methods. 100: 107-114.) The PCR was carried out as described previously (Kojima, S. above). The amplicon was sequenced and its relationship to known NoV strains were determined by phylogentics analysis program ClustalX as described by Thompson et. al. (1997). (Thompson J.D., Gibson,T.J., Plewniak,F., Jeanmougin,F. and Higgins,D.G. (1997) The CLUSTAL_X windows interface: flexible strategies for multiple sequence alignment aided by quality analysis tools. Nucleic Acids Res., 25, 4876–4882.). A phylogentic tree from boot-strap analysis was generated by Neibour-Joining method. Other norovirus samples were genotyped by Dr. William Burkhardt (FDA, Dauphin Island, AL) and by Dr. Jan Vinje (CDC, Atlanta, GA) via RT-PCR.\\nHybridization Profile of coxsackieviruses A and B and different strains of HAV\\n35\\nCXKV A2Fig 1.

The insert shows the close-up view of positive detection of HAV-derived sequence.\\nStatistical analysis:\\n38\\nStatistical significance of array hybridization signals is computed using array package software where data points are calculated as signal intensity above normalized background (corrected to internal standards) and converted to average probe intensity (Jackson et al. 2007; Wong et al. 2004). Viral samples in the form of stool samples from outbreak investigations will be provided by CDC (NoV) and CBER (RV). The samples will have been typed by specific RT-PCR based methods prior to coding and then supplied to us for microarray experiments. Any initial negative hybridization will trigger a re-sampling and analysis due to the possibility of sampling error or a negative (no virus) sample. Sampling error rates and percent positive identification (following code breakage) will be used to determine statistical success rate of the microarray analysis. We realize that a sample with very low viral load may produce poor hybridization signal. In that case, the viral RNA will be amplified in a sequence non-specific manner using T7 RNA polymerase to preserve the original distribution.\\nIsolation and labeling of Viral RNA:\\nThe success of our microarray screening protocol depends on target synthesis that is not specific to any particular virus. In our preliminary experiments we have achieved target synthesis for our microarray hybridization experiments by eliminating the PCR step by relying on a highly efficient synthesis and labeling of target. Viral RNA was purified from the all virus containing stool samples with a QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer primers. The resultant cDNA is fragmented by DNase 1 digestion and the mixture of the fragments is labeled with biotin-11-ddATP (PerkinElmer, MA) in the presence of Terminal Transferase (Invitrogen, CA). The use of\\n39\\nddATP assures that only a single nucleotide is added to the 3’end of each cDNA fragments and therefore the hybridization characteristics to the oligo-probes on the array is not altered. For signal amplification at the end of hybridization, the biotin in the target now hybridized to the probe is reacted with cy3 labeled streptavidin. The cy3 is detected by scanning and the scans analyzed for the detection of hybridization to specific probes on the array. An example of a typical result is shown in Fig.1. The applicability of this protocol in detecting a single species of virus is shown in Fig.2. The experiment detected genogroup I of NV, with the two peaks of average intensities identifying two different strains. Significantly, the microarray detected two different strains of group I NV in the same sample. The smaller peak has a 91% sequence identity to the main peak supporting our hypothesis (see above) that outbreak samples may contain multiple NV strains that can only be detected using microarray.\\nThe second hypothesis that we propose to test is that microarray hybridization can detect multiple viruses in the same experiment if the target is synthesized and labeled using technology that are not dependent on sequence specific PCR amplification. An example is shown in Fig.3 from a recent experiment carried out in our laboratory. RNA samples from three different viruses HAV (genotype HM175), NoV (Group I) and HEB (strain CVB 3) were separately reverse transcribed and labeled as described above. The labeled cDNAs were mixed in equimolar quantities and hybridized. Analysis of hybridization data show that all three viruses were identified. In addition to the HAV and CV strains, the array experiment again identified two closely related strains of NoV as seen in Fig.2, that could not be distinguished by RT-PCR.
\\n What is EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY ?\\n\\nEducational technology may be defined as the arrangement of tools in order, that might prove helpful in advancing student learning. It includes systems that are used in the process of developing human capability. Technology can refer to the materials, tools; that humans use. some modern tools include LCD projectors,Laptop and Computers. Technology also means "applied science". In other words, any valid and reliable process or procedure that is derived from basic research using scientific method is considered technology. So,educational technology may be extended to include the techniques of the educators.\\n\\n\\n What are the importance of Educational Technology?\\n\\nEducational technology is very important to the humanities. Today, the instructor doesn't need to be in the same room where the learner is. All they need is an internet connection and they are ready to have a session of teaching. Today, learning becomes more interesting with the use of streaming audio and video or a Powerpoint presentation with voice overs. With the emergence of advanced technology, it is important that educators use these tools to their advantage to not only make teaching easier and more interesting but also to acquire more knowledge to their students.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can get more information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology

After practicing law for 29+ years I am amazed that I seem to be the only counsel that has been consistently using the term "fraudulator" to define, generally, one who actively engages in fraudulent, deceptive, and misrepresentative type behavior.  Fraud is precisely defined in Federal and State statutes, and has become part of American and English lexicon in terms of "common law" deliberate deceptions for unfair and/or unlawful gain and advantage.  It is also generally defined as a swindle or a trick, and has been known to describe an imposter.\\n\\nBut, I have yet to see or read about anyone who is consistently or chronically involved in this type of conduct as being a "FRAUDULATOR".\\n\\nI believe this word should be added to common dictionaries and particularly "BLACK's LAW DICTIONARY" as a word that best articulates the true sense of the root-word, Fraud, when describing an individual and/or entity that engages in intentional fraudulent and deceptive conduct.  \\n\\nThank you in advance for your comments.
:''"EPS systems do not require engine power to operate. Thus, a vehicle equipped with EPS may achieve an estimated improvement in fuel economy of 3% compared to the same vehicle with conventional HPS. As an added benefit, more of the engine's power is transmitted to its intended location — the wheels."''\\n\\nIn EPS systems, the engine has to turn an alternator rather than a hydraulic pump. EPS provides fuel efficiency gains because it is more efficient than hydraulic systems, not because it is using free energy. Generally, hydraulic power steering systems are on all the time (the engine is always running the hydraulic pump) while EPS systems are on demand (only using energy when needed). There may be other efficiency comparisons between EPS and conventional PS, but it is the engine doing the work.\\n\\nI suppose the only time the engine might not be operating the EPS is if the vehicle is a plug-in hybrid, but that accounts for about 0.00001% of the automotive population.

Individualist cultures are those in which people are on a whole loosely connected to each other and prefer to be identified as an individual. Self-importance, promotion, and achievement are highly valued. Competition is encouraged more than cooperation. Individualist cultures expect one to act for self-promotion and self-advancement in the job market. There is also competitiveness in social situations,where people are expected to fend for themselves and any sign of assistance (i.e. - getting set-up on a blind date)can be seen as a sign of weakness. Parental approval is helpful to have in situations such as marriage, but not necessary. People in an individualist culture place more importance on their own interests than the interests of other members of the culture.\\n\\nIndividualistic cultures place emphasis on the "I"consciousness.  These cultures are very competitive and self-centered, as opposed to the cooperation and loyalty focused values of a collectivist culture.  Individualistsvalue their privacy and usually indentify themselves as independent from the group indentity.  The JMU campus, for example, is largely individualistic.  The faculty, staff, and students of JMU are not necessarily unfriendly or unhelpful towards one another, but each student is competitive for the top grades and academic standing.  One will rarely ever witness a college student studying for hours on end in order to help his or her classmate achieve an A on an exam. Overall, individualist cultures emphasize individual goals,independence, privacy, and self-help.
'''Coral Reefs'''\\n     Coral reefs are very important ecosystems in our oceans. They are found in tropical areas that have clear, warm water. Coral reefs are formed by polyps that secrete hard calcareous exoskeletons, giving an amazingly firm structure. These colonial “hard corals” form elaborate finger-shaped, branching, or mound shaped structures and can create masses of limestone that stretch for tens or even hundreds of miles. These corals continue to build on top of the skeletal remains of older colonies and eventually a reef is established. Today, richly diverse coral reefs are found in the tropics along coastlines, on the margins of volcanic islands, and as isolated coral atolls. According to a website I found, coral reefs are home to over 25 percent of all marine life and are among the world's most fragile and endangered ecosystems. In the last few decades over 35 million acres of coral reefs have been destroyed and many other reefs have been damaged. One of the major threats to coral reefs is coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which corals lose their distinctive color because they expel the zooxanthellae that live within them. This bleaching is caused by stress to the corals. If a coral is fully bleached, it will turn entirely white, and will die unless the stress on the coral is reduced, allowing the zooxanthellae to return to the coral. The main causes of stress to the coral reefs are the rising water temperatures of the ocean and increased ultraviolet radiation. Two other factors that are believed to be causing stress to the reefs are increased salinity and increased sedimentation. Coral reefs are important, because they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and help regulate atmospheric temperatures, they protect our coastlines from erosion, act as homes to many marine animals, they are used for fishing, provide people with jobs, and of course they play a significant role in tourism.\\n\\nEnvironmental News Network staff.

Besides writing books, Le Roy Ladurie is a prolific essayist writing on variety of subjects such as the utility of computers as method of historical research, rates of delinquency in the French Army in the 19th century, the spread of global diseases and the belief of French peasants that magic could be used to generate impotence. The latter was a reference to the widespread practice of French peasant men in the Middle Ages and the early modern period of paying witches to use their (supposed) magical powers to make their rivals in love go impotent. Le Roy Ladurie is also known as one of the first modern [[environmental historian]]s because his work focused on human agency in environmental change, as well as environmental factors in human history.
see: www.PedroBOrtiz.com\\n\\nSince June 2010, the world has reached the threshold where more than 50% of its population lives in cities. Growth of many metropolitan urban areas is experiencing an annual growth of 4% to 6%. This means a doubling of population each 15 years. It now takes only 15 years to grow as much as the regions did during the past 400 years. This phenomena is not natural growth nor even rapid growth. It can only be defined as explosive growth.\\n\\nThis phenomenon must be controlled to avoid the metastasis of slums that's currently taking place. If this is not addressed, these metropolises will be unsustainable and will not be incapable of competing in global markets. The World Bank is addressing this critical issue through its Urban Unit of the Sustainable Development Network, supporting the work done throughout the world by the Region Units (LAC, MENA, SSA, ECA, SEA, EPA). \\n\\nPedro Ortiz introduced a metropolitan growth methodology in the 1996 when he developed the Madrid Regional Plan, (the ORT, (Ordenacion Reticular del Territorio). This plan addressed the explosive growth Madrid was experiencing at that time (50% every 20 years). It was successful in controlling and monitoring the the city's growth in a sustainable manner (Spatial and Transport integrated policies). This methodology (Smart Metropolises: MetroCT Method) is now being enhanced and applied to numerous metropolises globally.
==Quantitative Taxonomy of Wikipedia Editors==\\n\\n===Abstract===\\nSome quantitative methods for categorizing Wikipedia editors and their editing styles are described. \\n\\n===Introduction===\\nWikipedia is one of the most popular websites on the internet. It is composed of several million articles written in over 250 different languages. Wikipedia is created by  thousands of volunteer editors, who are guided by a set of policies, principles, guidelines, conventions and traditions. Different editors are involved in a wide variety of tasks, and exhibit different editing styles. \\n\\nThere are many reasons to categorize editing styles on Wikipedia. For example, not all editing styles contribute equally to the production of Wikipedia, and it is valuable to understand which styles are more useful to Wikipedia and in what circumstances. Recognizing unproductive or inefficient behavior and measuring it's characteristics  can be useful in the creation of evidence-based management systems, which hopefully will replace the current intuition-based management systems. For example, when selecting editors for promotion to administrative positions, or other positions of responsibility, current methods can skew the selection process towards those with limited forms of editing experience. Gauging editing styles and experiences can allow a conscious decision to avoid certain kinds of editors, to create a wider diversity of candidates, or to otherwise assist in the selection process. Also, measuring the results of certain administrative actions or imposition of policy changes can be valuable information for evaluating the appropriateness of these actions and changes.\\n\\nQuantitative methods of analysis are often desirable. Quantitative methods are amenable to automation and computer implementation, which is appropriate for a computer-based document production project.  Numerically-based procedures can reveal features of situations that are not readily apparent to less exacting and rigorous methods.
Our Children’s Place is a non-profit organization which aims at allowing young children, mostly infants and preschoolers to live with their mothers while the women serve out their sentences for nonviolent offenses. This initiative breaks the cycle of crime, poverty, substance abuse and family violence among generations as well as empowers the child with the help of his/her mother to enhance his/her social, cognitive, physical and emotional development. Ultimately, this project could allow many children to develop better inter-personal skills for their future by interacting with their mothers and will allow them a better chance at a successful future. Our Children’s Place was spear-headed by North Carolina Senator Ellie Kinniard in 2004. They are finally completing construction on a $3.5 million facility that will be able to hold ten women and twenty children, which will open in 2010. These women must be serving a sentence of three years or less and must be convicted of a non-violent crime. The children will receive free childcare, in addition to sessions with therapists and other health professionals. Our Children’s Place also works with H.A.T.S. (Handcrafted And Totally Special), an organization that allows female inmates and community members to create hats and other items.\\n\\n<ref></ref>http://ourchildrensplace.com/

I take a special interest in the history and science of cancer bacteria research. I have avidly studied this field for twenty five years, have conducted myriad interviews, initiated correspondences with leading and independent cancer organizations including NCI and ACS, and have compiled a sizeable library of published research, correspondences, audio tapes of interviews and newspaper records dating back to early 20th century.\\n\\nOver the years, I have grown from someone opinionated on the topic of "alternative medicine," to someone who has become totally dedicated to judicious presentation of facts and historical records, well aware of the many myths, half-truths and conjectures that exist regarding this subject. Unfortunatley, there is a fair amount of distorted information about cancer bacteria research both in the popular mainstream, and among so-called "advocates." Thus I feel it an obligation as a published author and medical journalist, to convey the highest quality information I am able in the hopes of promoting a better dialogue.
An essential role of Open Access is the long-term preservation of peer-reviewed scholarly journal articles and research data. Submit your scientific, medical and technical researches for publishing. Promotion of Open Access is very crucial to encourage innovation, sociology-economic development, and flow of knowledge around the world. As such, Open Access can be defined as an instrument ultimately used for public welfare to stimulate the growth of global science, as well as maintain the quality of scientific achievements at the same time.
What UP does:\\n\\nUP is a group of under-30s based in London in the UK who want to support people of their own age affected by depression. Their aim is to raise awareness of depression, promote understanding of mental health issues and work to reduce the stigma that might prevent depression sufferers seeking help. UP is there to encourage seeking the best support to help individuals, families and friends learn to overcome the illness, improve quality of life and realise potential.\\n\\nUP is part of the Charlie Waller Memorial Trust (CWMT).\\n\\nWhy target young people?\\n\\nDepression is widespread among the under-30s. This age group often struggle to cope with the pressures of education, work, money, relationships and simply finding their way in the world. Sadly, it is also the age group most likely to try to cover up any mental health issues.\\n\\nUnwarranted shame, lack of information or believing that this age group should just ’pull their socks up‘ mean that they’re often unable to admit to friends, family or even themselves that something’s wrong. But with depression, something is badly wrong.\\n\\nUP believes it shouldn’t be this way. UP promotes finding the correct treatment, that really works; currently in the UK there’s no clear path to getting help. Often the most common answer to the question “what would you do if you felt depressed, or worried that a friend might be?” is “I don’t know”. UP wants to answer that question and provide a gateway to the support that may be needed.
                                      '''\\n                                        '''''Contemporary society''''' ''                \\n\\nContemporary society, according to social and political scientists, is characterised by at least three fundamental directions:\\n* '''increasing human interconnection''' through a network of relationships that is progressively covering the whole planet;\\n* '''the pace and depth of the evolution of human ways of life''' determined by technological innovation represent an absolute novelty in human history;\\n* the scale of '''anthropological and and ecological transformation''' due to the interaction between evolutionary factors (social, cultural, economic, and technological) has no historical precedent.\\n\\nThese directions are the result of a number of fundamental changes that are irreversibly transforming our daily lives, our way of thinking and perceiving the world and our way of living together. Among these fundamental changes are: improvements in life conditions, life expectancy, literacy and gender equality; changes in domestic and international political institutions; and the breakdown of natural equilibria.\\n\\n\\n==Improvement of life conditions==\\nThe UN estimates that, at the beginning of the 20th century, about 60% of the world population lived in conditions of extreme poverty. In 1981, 40% of the world population lived extreme poverty. In 2001, the percentage had been halved to 20%.\\nSeveral developing countries, in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa, still suffer from social and economic backwardness, but life conditions have significantly improved in most regions of the world, in particular in Asia. \\nThe overall improvement in life conditions and the role of technologies now available have contributed to increase GDP per capita by one and a half times in less than half a century (1960-2005), with peaks of over eight times in Eastern Asia. Only in a few countries, concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, growth of per capita income has been very slow.\\n\\n\\n==Life expectancy==\\nIn 1960, the average life expectancy of the world population was 50 years. Forty-five years later, in 2004, life expectancy had improved by over 30% to 67 years. Improvements in health care and the reduction in child mortality have led to a jump forward in middle-income countries, where life expectancy is now over 70 years. In high-income countries life expectancy is now over 80 years, extending well beyond the traditional length of working life, causing social and economic problems.\\n\\n\\n==Literacy and gender equality==\\nThe ability to read and write is next to universal: in 2004, 80% of adult men and 73% of adult women had basic literacy skills. Of great social importance is the rapid growth of female school enrollment and the increasing presence of women in the labour market. These deep changes constitute a primary driver of economic growth in developing countries.\\nFemale literacy has great consequences in terms of fertility. When female school enrollment and employment rates increase, fertility rates decline rapidly and tend to stabilise around the natural rate of reproduction of 2.1 children per women (see E. Todd, "After the Empire"). Several demographers believe that, as a consequence, world population will stabilise over the next few decades, at a level compatible with the resources of the planet [reference].\\n\\n\\n==Spread of communication technologies==\\nThe world population has a number of "passive" (broadcasting) communication technologies (radio, television) that cover the whole globe. Moreover, a large portion of the population uses "active" commmunication technologies (telephone, internet). Internet connections are expanding rapidly: in 2004 there were 140 Internet users every 1000 inhabitants (according to data from the "International Communication Union"). The spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) is remodelling the material fundaments of society. The sociologist [[Manuel_Castells|Castells]] believes that these technologies have started a revolution of the productive structures of society and of daily life.\\n\\nThe new communication technologies represent a critical instrument to obtain consensus and as a result they are transforming the organisational models of the State and of politics. The power system becomes less visible but more pervasive in the way it can influence choices and ways of thinking Manuel_Castells|M. Castells]], "Galassia Internet", Feltrinelli, [[2002]]).\\n\\n\\n==Economic growth and evolution of political institutions==\\nThe economic success of authoritarian regimes, mainly in Asia, suggests that (at least in the short term) economic growth is independent from the democratisation of political institutions. However, economic development favours the development of democratic institutions--but only if economic growth leads to substantial changes in cultural and social structures. ([[Ronald Inglehart|R. Inglehart]], "La società postmoderna").\\nThe "World Values Survey", which captures political values in 43 countries, shows that no country with a per capita income below the poverty line has democratic or free institutions. Almost the totality of nations with high per capita income are classified as democratic.\\n\\n==Globalisation==\\nOver the last fifty years, world GDP has increased by about five times, while trade has increased ten-fold over the same period. These data suggests that the intensity of the commercial exchange between countries has developed faster than the overall economy. However, globalisation has gone beyond the exchange of physical commodities and it is progressively modelling also the lifestyles and consumption patterns of individuals and societies. The Swiss think-tank KOF has developed a number of globalisation indicators that show the increasing development of global individual, social and commercial networks.\\n\\n\\n==Social tension and opposition to change==\\nNew international flows have diminished the role of traditional political institutions--sometimes with negative consequences for social stability. In many societies, stability (or slow evolution) has been substituted by unstoppable and irreversable transformations.\\nAs a result, individuals and communities perceive a high degree of insecurity--insecurity that touches every aspect of their lives. Growing masses of people feel threatened by the changes that affect their material (work, income, house), psychological (personal relationships), and cultural life (with the need to continuously update knowledge and professional skills)[[Digital divide|it.Wikipedia.org "Digital divide"]]).\\nThe social improvement of the masses --resulting from increasing literacy and income, universal means of communication and a new social role of women-- has eroded the traditional role of the elites and have weakened the traditional regulatory role of the state.\\nAs the speed of social and cultural evolution sweeps away old life habits, religious beliefs, ancestral moral convictions and radicated political opinions, the anxiety towards a future that is mutating and unknown causes a cultural opposition that is at the root of fundamentalism. Opposition against new life conditions is justified also by increasing economic inequality: "the gap between the wealth of the North and that of the South of the world has increased by a multiple of five since the beginning of the XX century" ({{in lang|fr}} [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cohen_%28%C3%A9conomiste%29 Daniel Cohen], "Trois leçons sur la société postindustrielle").\\n\\n\\n==Breakdown of natural equilibria==\\nWhen demographic growth is multiplied by the growth of per capita income and consumption, one can have a measure of the global impact on environmental sustainability. Demographic and economic development is endangering our current forms of civilisation and social co-living and our future ability to inhabit our planet.\\nAlternative scenarios developed by international organisations suggest the possibility of a serious breakdown of natural equilibrium unless political, scientific and economic tools are directed to a correction towards an acceptable equilibrium between humankind and with nature.\\n\\n\\n== Related voices==\\n* {{in lang|en}} [[:en:Samir Amin|Samir Amin]]\\n* [[Zygmunt Bauman]]\\n* [[Manuel Castells]]\\n* [[Derrick de Kerckhove]]\\n* [[Anthony Giddens]]\\n* [[Jack Goody]]\\n* [[Ronald Inglehart]]\\n* [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Levy]]\\n* [[Nicholas Negroponte]]\\n* [[Emmanuel Todd]]\\n* [[Immanuel Wallerstein]]\\n* {{in lang|en}} [[:en:Martin Wolf|Martin Wolf]]\\n* [[Postmaterialismo]]\\n* {{in lang|ca}} [http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moviments_socials Moviments socials]\\n\\n==Sources==\\n* World Bank: World Development Indicators Online database [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20398986~menuPK:64133163~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html]\\n* World Bank: Social Indicators of Development 2004\\n* World Bank: Data & Statistics, 2001\\n* World Bank: International Telecommunications Union\\n* Human Development Index\\n* UNO Yearbook 2004\\n* World Value Survey\\n* Eurobarometro\\n* Konjunkturforschungsstelle (KOF): Index of Globalization 2004\\n* International Monetary Fund: World Economic and Financial Survey 2006\\n* UNESCO/OECD: World Education Indicators Programme 1999\\n* United Nations Development Program: Human Development Report 2004\\n* United Nations Population Division: World Population Prospect, 2000\\n\\n==Bibliography (in Italian)==\\n* Krishan Kumar, "Le nuove teorie del mondo contemporaneo" 2000\\n* Martin Wolf, "Perché la globalizzazione funziona" 2006\\n* Ulrich Beck, "Cos'è la globalizzazione" 1999\\n* Peter Sloterdijk, "Breve storia filosofica della globalizzazione" 2002\\n* Peter Sloterdijk, "La morte nel postumanismo" 2004\\n* Peter Sloterdijk, "Non siamo ancora stati salvati" 2001\\n* Jack Goody, "Capitalismo e modernità" 2005\\n* Samir Amin, "Il capitalismo nell'era della globalizzazione" 1997\\n* Zygmunt Bauman, "Dentro la globalizzazione" 2001\\n* Pierre Lévy, "les tecnologies de l'intelligence" 1990\\n* Nicholas Negroponte, "Essere digitali" 1990\\n* Manuel Castells, "Il potere dell'identità" 2003\\n* Manuel Castells, "Galassia internet" 2002\\n* Manuel Castells, "La nascita della società in rete" 2002\\n* Derrick de Kerckhove (a cura di), "Brainframes" 1991\\n* Mark Dery, "Velocità di fuga" 1997\\n* Kevin Robins, "Oltre l'immagine" 1999\\n* Remo Bodei, "Destini personali" 2002\\n* Michel Foucault, "Tecnologie del sè" 1992\\n* Antony Giddens, "La Trasformazione dell'intimità" 1995\\n* Emmanuel Todd, "Dopo l'impero" 2003\\n* Ronald Inglehart, "La società postmoderna" 1998\\n* Daniel Cohen, " Trois leçons sur la société postindustrielle" 2005
=World War II: Mobilization=\\n<br/>\\n==Introduction==\\n<br/>\\n   World War II was the largest and most violent armed conflict in the history of mankind. However, the half century that now separates \\nus from that conflict has exacted its toll on our collective knowledge. While World War II continues to absorb the interest of military scholars and historians, as well as its veterans, a generation of Americans has grown to maturity largely unaware of the political, social, and military implications of a war that, more than any other, united us as a people with a common purpose.\\n\\n \\n\\n   Highly relevant today, World War II has much to teach us, not only about the profession of arms, but also about military preparedness, global strategy, and combined operations in the coalition war against fascism. During the next several years, the U.S. Army will participate in the nation's 50th anniversary commemoration of World War II. The commemoration will include the publication of various materials to help educate Americans about that war. The works produced will provide great opportunities to learn about and renew pride in an Army that fought so magnificently in what has been called "the mighty endeavor."\\n\\n \\n\\nWorld War II was waged on land on sea, and in the air over several diverse theaters of operation for approximately six years. The following essay on the wartime mobilization effort supplements a series of studies on the Army's campaigns of that war.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis brochure was prepared in the U.S. Army Center of Military History by Frank N. Schubert. I hope this absorbing account of that period will enhance your appreciation of American achievements during World War II.\\n\\n \\n\\nGORDON R.

'''What is Sustainable Tourism?'''\\n\\nSustainable tourism is a form of tourism that provides economic, social, and environmental benefits through the knowledgeable management of tourism resources. Long-term sustainability is achieved without losing any local cultural identity or natural values.\\n\\nBoth tourist operators and tourists can help achieve sustainable tourism.\\n\\n'''What kinds of tourism are sustainable?'''\\n \\nECOTOURISM : Ecotourism is a form of tourism that occurs in natural areas and integrates the local socio-cultural identity with ecosystem considerations. It promotes a sustainable ecosystem through a participatory environmental management processes involving all stakeholders.\\n \\nHEALTH TOURISM : Health tourism is a form of tourism involving activities that deliberately promote good health. Examples of health tourism include visiting exercise or meditation centres or resorts that provide health services or specialise in vegetariam food. Such visits are typically of a specified duration, such as 3,5, or 7 days.\\n \\nAGROTOURISM : Agrotourism is a form of tourism in agricultural areas such as orchards, agroforestry farms, herbal farms and animal farms, which have been prepared in some way for the tourists. More importantly, tourists gain experience in farming activities such as working with animals or harvesting crops, usually under the supervision of a farm guide. Lecture describing the operation of the farm may also be given.\\n \\nCULTURAL TOURISM : Cultural tourism is a form of tourism that allows tourists to admire and learn about local cultures and tradition. The local community participates in the management of this form of tourism, which is based on the principle of conserving local culture and the environment. Examples of culture-based tourism include visiting the Royal Court or experiencing local life in a hill-tribe village\\n\\n'''Every kind of existing tourism operation can become Sustainable Tourism if tourism managers take responsibility for the destinations socio-cultural and natural environment.'''
== Nigerian Public Policy ==\\n\\nBy: Hannah Viertel, Taylor Stein, and Karli Lutton\\n\\n\\na. Three facts from today's reading\\n\\n1) The reason most Nigerians live in debt is due to Nigeria’s large dependence on oil revenue. Instead of the people benefiting from the oil revenue, the government officials pocket all of the money, leaving their people in poverty. \\n\\n2) Most Nigerians support federalism; they want any power to be shared and they want to be able to contact their government which would in turn create a true democratic rule. Many southerners point out that federalism can only exist if the central government gives some of its power to state and local governments.\\n\\n3) After international oil prices plummeted in the early 1980's, Nigeria was forced to turn to international organizations for help in managing its huge national debt. In 1985, the Babangida regime developed an economic restructural adjustment program with the support of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The program sought to restructure and diversify the Nigerian economy so that it could decrease its dependence on oil.\\n\\n\\nb. Three assumptions from today's reading\\n\\n1) The government of Nigeria operates under a patron-clientelism system in which the military and political elite operate with only their self interest in mind. State control of resources means that those in the pyramid get the spoils and they alone have access to wealth and influence.\\n\\n2) Southerners protested the practice of revenue sharing because they do not trust the government and therefore no one believed that the profits would benefit anyone except corrupt government officials.\\n\\n3) Northerners generally don't support the true federalism movement with regions controlling their own resources because their regions historically have not had as many resources or as much revenue to share.  Many northern states benefit more than southerners from nationally sponsored redistribution programs.\\n\\n\\nc. Three unanswered questions from today's reading\\n\\n1) Will Nigeria be able to remain together as a nation despite their lack of a coherent national identity?\\n\\n2) Will Nigeria ever be able to diversify its economy and not rely solely on oil?\\n\\n3) Is it possible for Nigeria to change from its system of patron-clientelism to establish a true democracy?
{{Userspace draft|source=ArticleWizard|date=December 2009}}\\n\\n'''KOMAZA''' is a not-for-profit social enterprise working to end rural poverty and unlock economic opportunities for smallholder farmers living in Kenya’s semi-arid climates. \\n\\nFounded in 2006 by Tevis Howard, the organization has developed an innovative grassroots model that generates an unprecedented amount of income for rural families by helping them plant cash crops on previously degraded land. These crops are then harvested, processed and sold to high-value markets.\\n\\nDue to the dry, semi-arid conditions of Coastal Kenya, most people struggle to subsist on poor harvests from drought-prone, infertile land. Because families cannot generate enough money to survive, they have also grown more reliant on the unsustainable use of natural resources, leaving agricultural livelihoods in further peril. This leads to a perpetual cycle of extreme poverty and irreversible deforestation.  \\nIn response to these challenges, KOMAZA has developed intensive microforestry programs, combining microfinance, forestry and family farming.  After identifying interested farmer groups under the advice and consent of community leadership, KOMAZA provides farmers with appropriate farm inputs and tools on credit – such as improved seeds, fertilizer and irrigation technologies.  Then, working through an extension network of more than 50 field staff, KOMAZA offers on-farm training and support as well as complete vertically integrated value capture services so that farmers can access markets and earn a profit.  Farmers can then reinvest this profit to start their own business, pay school fees for their children and receive improved healthcare.  \\n\\nThe organization’s portfolio of crops provides both an immediate and permanent increase in annual income to improve basic life conditions and also yields large lump-sum capital for families to reinvest in major life improvements.  According to KOMAZA, its farm families can earn the equivalent of ten to twenty years’ income over the eight-year lifespan of a half-acre tree farm. KOMAZA has also established two industry-leading experimental farms to research agricultural best-practices for semi-arid farmers. \\n\\nKOMAZA (Swahili for "promote development; encourage growth") is based in Kilifi, Kenya.  As of December 2009, the organization has partnered with nearly 500 farm families, benefiting X.  KOMAZA plans to significantly expand its operations in Kenya to reach 10,000 farmers by the end of 2012.  \\n\\nKOMAZA is registered as a 501(c) 3 charitable organization in the United States and incorporated in the State of California.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n== External links ==\\n* [http://www.example.com/ example.com] \\n\\n\\n<!--- Categories --->
'''Non-kinetic operations'''\\n\\n"active, as opposed to latent." Dropping bombs and shooting bullets—you know, killing people—is kinetic. But the 21st-century military is exploring less violent and more high-tech means of warfare, such as messing electronically with the enemy's communications equipment or wiping out its bank accounts. These are "non-kinetic."\\n\\n\\nThe kinetic part is easily defined: using the military to kill\\nterrorists “with a global reach,” disrupt their infrastructure,\\nand dissuade those who fund terrorists and their state sponsors upon threat (and occasionally actual visitation) of physical injury.\\n\\nThe nonkinetic parts are often euphemized as the “drain\\nthe swamp” or, better, the “hearts and minds” problem. These\\nnonmilitary aspects focus on terrorism’s motivation and\\nrecruitment patterns, the sociology of terrorist groups that\\nleads them to mobilize, compete, and strike; and the underlying social conditions said to feed that motivation and those\\nrecruitment patterns.\\n\\n\\nGetting at the nonkinetic aspects of the war on terrorism\\ncan be conceived as consisting of immediate, midterm, and\\nlong-term parts. The essence at all stages, however, appears to\\nbe fourfold:\\n#Stigmatize the idea of murdering civilians for any political cause whatsoever, just as slavery, piracy, and human ritual sacrifice were so stigmatized in previous generations.\\n#Identify and stop the flow of money and other resources at all levels from those who approve of terrorism to those who carry it out, redirecting that money and those resources to positive ends, as possible.\\n#Refute, tirelessly and skillfully, the almost endless distortions of U.S. policies and motivations that are promulgated by Islamist propagandists (and others) and that inexorably make Americans and their allies targets of hatred and violence.\\n#Work patiently at social, economic, and political reform (generally in that order) in Muslim-majority countries and among Muslim communities outside the Middle East and South Asia where terrorist cadres are known to have arisen.\\n\\n\\nNonkinetic operations. Training units in non-kinetic operations requires establishing an environment in which human terrain predominates. In such an environment, units can employ nonkinetic resources such as civil affairs (CA) and psychological operations (PSYOP) teams and public affairs officers; and they can conduct leader engagements, disburse money, and participate in reconstruction. to provide the human terrain necessary to train nonkinetic operations, the NTC populates its towns and villages with up to 1,600 role players, of which 250 are Iraqi-Americans who remain in their roles and live in the field for the entire 14-day training event. Each role player is influenced by respective tribal and religious leaders and maintains familial, social, and business relationships throughout the rotation. Some role players have businesses and jobs; others are unemployed and disenfranchised, ripe for insurgent recruitment. Each urban area has its own government structure, police force, businesses, criminal element, and ethnic tension. Provincial government and police forces also exert influence on towns and villages.\\n\\nThe human terrain element makes leaders and soldiers engage with real Iraqis, a function that requires them to adapt to Iraqi culture and seek cooperation. Leaders conduct engagements and negotiate with provincial, town, and tribal leaders to gather information on insurgent activity and to find out who can create jobs, provide medical aid, or develop reconstruction projects. The human element also allows the training unit to employ CA and PSYOP teams throughout its area of operations to influence the role players. Iraqi role players' attitudes change based on unit actions.\\n\\nThe recently constructed Joint coordination center, modeled after facilities in theater, is the focal point of nonkinetic operations. It serves as a coordination center for those acting as coalition forces; Iraqi security forces; local government, tribal and religious leaders; local security and medical personnel; and nongovernmental organization (NGO) workers.\\n\\n\\na Kinetic warfare situation where we are in all out war: dropping bombs, rolling in with tanks, shooting everything that moves. We have since moved on from a Kinetic warfare situation to a Expanded Warfare situation where our primary concerns are to maintain order, repair infrastructure, implement domestic services, and conduct warfare operations against those that wish to disrupt the previous objectives.
     Did you know that there is another disastrous event aside from global warming?\\nIt is called global dimming.Global dimming is the gradual reduction in the amount of global hemispherical irradiance (or total solar irradiance) at the Earth's surface, observed since the beginning of systematic measurements in 1950s. The effect varies by location, but worldwide it is of the order of a 5% reduction over the three decades from 1960–1990. This trend has reversed during the past decade. Global dimming creates a cooling effect that may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.\\n\\n     It is currently thought that the effect of global dimming is probably due to the increased presence of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Aerosol particles and other particulate pollutants absorb solar energy and reflect sunlight back into space. The pollutants can also become nuclei for cloud droplets. It is thought that the water droplets in clouds coalesce around the particles. Increased pollution, resulting in more particulates, creates clouds consisting of a greater number of smaller droplets, which in turn makes them more reflective, therefore bouncing more sunlight back into space.\\n\\n     Clouds intercept both heat from the sun and heat radiated from the Earth. Their effects are complex and vary in time, location and altitude. Usually during the daytime the interception of sunlight predominates, giving a cooling effect; however, at night the re-radiation of heat to the Earth slows the Earth's heat loss.\\n\\n     Early reports of "global dimming" attracted little interest, perhaps because the term itself had not yet been coined. The earliest reports seem to be by M. Budyko: "The effect of solar radiation variations on the climate of the Earth" in 1969, published in Tellus. From the late 1980s onwards, scientists independently began working on solar radiation datasets and discovered declining trends worldwide; Atsumo Ohmura Secular variation of global radiation in Europe in 1989; Vivii Russak in 1990 "Trends of solar radiation, cloudiness and atmospheric transparency during recent decades in Estonia", and Beate Liepert in 1994 "Solar radiation in Germany - Observed trends and an assessment of their causes". Gerry Stanhill who studied these declines worldwide in many papers coined the term "dimming". Dimming exists in sites all over the Former Soviet Union.\\n\\n     Independent research in Israel and the Netherlands in the late 1980s showed an apparent reduction in the amount of sunlight, despite widespread evidence that the climate was actually becoming hotter. The rate of dimming varies around the world but is on average estimated at around 2–3% per decade, with the possibility that the trend reversed in the early 1990s. It is difficult to make a precise measurement, due to the difficulty in accurately calibrating the instruments used, and the problem of spatial coverage. Nonetheless, the effect is almost certainly present.\\n\\n     The effect is due to changes within the Earth's atmosphere; the value of the solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere has not changed by more than a fraction of this amount.
 I am a Sri Lankan native and currently affiliated \\nat the Asian Studies and Department of Political Science, Temple University, Philadelphia. I teach courses on comparative politics such as nationalism and ethnic conflict and foreign governments and politics. Also, teach courses on modern China and Modern India.\\n\\nMy studies cover two major aspects: the symbolic politics of elites and\\npoliticization of ethnic differences, especially in Sri Lanka. My most\\nrecent research examines issues pertaining to Muslims in Sri Lanka and Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region in China. My scholarly pursuit has born fruit as publications in leading journals in my areas of study, such as Journal of South Asia, the Journal of Asian and African Studies (JAAS),the Journal of Third World Studies (JTWS) and Asian Affairs. In addition,I have published a number of research findings in international newspapers.\\n\\nIn recent years, my research has been concerned with the rising religious\\ntrends in South Asia and Middle East. Over the next few years, my project\\nwould focus on religious illiberalism and its inherent challenges to\\nsecular regimes and political actors in South Asia and the Middle East.
Physics (Greek: physis – φύσις meaning "nature") is a natural science that involves the study of matter, its motion through spacetime, and all allied components, such as energy and force. This has led to the discovery and understanding of the laws and principles which govern the physical universe. More broadly, Physics is the general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the world and universe behave. One tool which helps with this general analysis is the study of the elementary constituents of the universe and their interactions.\\n\\nPhysics is one of the oldest academic disciplines, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy. Evidence exists that the earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000 BCE, such as the Sumerians, Ancient Egyptians, and the Indus Valley Civilization, all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. Although originally part of other physical sciences and mathematics, Physics emerged to become a unique modern science during the Scientific Revolution of the 16th century.\\n\\nPhysics is both significant and influential, in part because advances in its understanding have often translated into new technologies, but also because new ideas in physics often resonate with other sciences, mathematics, and philosophy. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products which have dramatically transformed modern-day society (e.g., television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons); advances in thermodynamics led to the development of motorized transport; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.\\n\\nPhysics also has philosophical implications. It can be historically traced back to ancient Greek philosophy. From Thales' first attempt to characterize matter, to Democritus' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state, the Ptolemaic astronomy of a crystalline firmament, and Aristotle's book Physics, different Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature. Well into the 18th century, physics was known as "Natural philosophy". By the 19th century physics was realized as a positive science and a distinct discipline separate from philosophy and the other sciences. Physics, as with the rest of science, relies on philosophy of science to give an adequate description of the scientific method.\\n\\n\\nMore about physics\\nedit  \\nSelected article\\nPortrait of Galileo Galilei by Giusto Sustermans\\n\\n    Galileo Galilei was an Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who played a major role in the Scientific Revolution. His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations and support for Copernicanism. Galileo has been called the "father of modern observational astronomy", the "father of modern physics", the "father of science", and "the Father of Modern Science".\\n\\nHis contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter (named the Galilean moons in his honour), and the observation and analysis of sunspots. Galileo also worked in applied science and technology, inventing an improved military compass and other instruments.\\n\\nGalileo's championing of heliocentrism was controversial within his lifetime, when most subscribed to either geocentrism or the Tychonic system.[9] He met with opposition from astronomers, who doubted heliocentrism due to the absence of an observed stellar parallax. The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, and they concluded that it could only be supported as a possibility, not as an established fact. Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point. He was tried by the Inquisition, found "vehemently suspect of heresy", forced to recant, and spent the rest of his life under house arrest. It was while Galileo was under house arrest that he wrote one of his finest works, Two New Sciences. Here he summarized the work he had done some forty years earlier, on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials.\\n\\n    Classical mechanics describes the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, as well as astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, stars, and galaxies. Within these domains, it produces very accurate results. And thus, is one of the oldest and largest subjects in science, engineering and technology. Besides this, many related specialties deal with gases, liquids, and solids, and so on. In addition, classical mechanics is enhanced by special relativity for high velocity objects that are approaching the speed of light. General relativity is employed to handle gravitation at a deeper level, and finally, quantum mechanics handles the wave-particle duality of atoms and molecules.\\n\\nMore selected articles\\nedit  \\nSelected picture\\n\\nThe Hubble Deep Field (HDF) is an image of a small region in the constellation Ursa Major, constructed from a series of observations by the Hubble Space Telescope.

Hi,\\n\\nI'm a newbie here, so please forgive me as I learn.\\n\\nThe travelogue film has a rich culture and history, which has been largely ignored by other film-related discussions. Indeed, the travelogue film was one of the earliest forms of filmmaking. It is, however, a hybrid art form, a combination of filmmaking, lecturing, entertainment, education, and performing art. Travelogue filmmakers make their films almost entirely alone or with a partner, relative, friend or spouse, without the aid of large crews, or, generally speaking, outside funding. They present an overview of a country or region, featuring its industry and culture, and travel around the continent showing their films and presenting them to the audience at a live theatrical event.\\n\\nI am a former Travel Adventure Film (Travelogue) Artist and I am interested in collaborating on articles relating to the history and culture of this unique and little-understood artform, and the unique, individual film artists who have produced them over the last century and more.
               The spate of recent terrorist attacks on Bombay only goes to evince the fact as to how vulnerable the megalopolis was for such unsuspected assaults that left as many as 180 people dead ,and about 200 wounded in the carnage perpetrated by the assailants.Though the intelligent inputs clearly indicated such possible assaults by the terrorists,no preventive steps were taken either by the Center or by the state government which turned pathetically helpless to defend its citizens, and became susceptible to the vitriolic criticism by the people across the country.A few face- saving measures were initiated to pacify the groundswell of peoples' anger.The change of a home minister or the ousting of a chief minister will not absolve the government of the sins of omission or commission unless a foolproof defensive mechanism is in order.India needs to fortify its intelligence wing, and make it much more accountable.The gross failure to warn the Indian leadership of the possible terrorist attacks only leaves wide gaps in the defence of the country.Every citizen needs to be protected since the constitution guarantees the fundamental right to live ,and the present governement has perforce to answer why it has woefully failed to protect its people.\\n\\nBy Dr Karanamrao

== North American Carbon Exchange ==\\n\\nThe [http://www.NoCarbEx.com North American Carbon Exchange NoCarbEx.com] is a voluntary "[[carbon_credit]]" exchange.  NoCarbEx purchases carbon credits from individuals and businesses planting trees to reduce greenhouse gases.  The Exchange bundles the shares of carbon credits and resells them to help businesses offset their carbon footprint. \\n\\n=== Lowering Greenhouse Gases ===\\nRising world levels of CO2 ([[Greenhouse effect]]) from fossil fuel emissions is a major cause of global warming. It is widely accepted that global temperature is increasing because world levels of CO2 are rising. The majority of the CO2 is produced by human activity, specifically by the burning of fossil fuels in power plants, automobiles, and deforestation.\\n\\nLowering these CO2 levels is being addressed by two major approaches. Non-fossil fuel approaches include nuclear, wind, and solar. Removing CO2 from the atmosphere is possible by planting trees. Wood, almost half carbon, provides one of the most commercially viable approaches for sequestering massive amounts of carbon dioxide. The world marketplace has existed since 2004 for carbon sequestration.  The largest US marketplace for voluntary carbon credits is the [[Chicago_Climate_Exchange]].\\n\\n=== Individual Participation in Carbon Credit Trading ===\\nThe North American Carbon Exchange allows individuals to participate in the voluntary carbon markets by providing financial incentives for [[afforestation]]. The Exchange has its own methodology to measure and transparently verify that all carbon dioxide offsets are additional and permanent. The NoCarbEx methodology fully complies or exceeds the principles of all major global warming regulatory regimes (i.e., the [[Kyoto_treaty]], the California Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and most of the draft US Federal Legislation). These principles are:\\n\\nAdditionality. From the perspective of global warming, offsets need to be additional and result in a net decrease of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In other words, the sequestration of greenhouse gases needs to happen in addition to what would happen in the absence of the intervention. \\n\\nLeakage. It is important to ensure that the additional carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere is not emitted elsewhere as a result of the planting of new trees. \\n\\nPermanence. The carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by growing trees needs to become "permanently" sequestered. NoCarbEx participants commit to keep the trees planted for a minimum of 40 years and pay a penalty if the tree is removed before this time. \\n\\nVerification. Every single tree registered with NoCarbEx has a technical data-sheet that is maintained by NoCarbEx showing the type of tree and its expected growth and carbon sequestration potential. All NoCarbEx trees are geo-referenced and can be found easily through Google or other mapping software.\\n\\n==Copyright problems==\\n[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|left|48px|]]Hello.

== Variable Transformers ==\\nA transformer is an electrical component which is used to convert ac voltage from one level to another, whereas variable transformers have the ability to vary the secondary (output) voltage. This is achieved by having a sliding or rolling electrical-carbon brush in contact with the windings which can be moved by using a control knob and scale or a servo-motor. For this reason, soon after ac electricity became widely available at the turn of the 19th century, they were used for regulating voltage in place of variable resistors which dissipated too much energy.Typical applications ranged from the dimming of theatre lighting to the speed control of electric train sets.\\nUp until the introduction of industrial power electronics the variable transformer was used widely for many applications where voltage regulation was required, including motor speed control, electroplating, cathodic protection and laboratory applications.
Trade Barriers\\n\\nJordon is located southwest of Asia on desert plains, surrounded by Israel, Syria, and Saudi Arabia. They established their independence in 1946, gaining the name Jordan in 1950. Jordan began to participate in the European Trade Association in 2001, after they acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2000 (CIA). \\nDuring the 1990s, Jordan’s performance was below its potential. From 2000 to\\n2002, Jordan achieved above expectations in terms of attracting FDI but its performance\\nin 2001 and 2002 was mainly a result of the September 11 attack. As performance lacked it’s potential in 2003 in answer to expectations of a war in Iraq.  Jordan became the only viable outlet for Iraqi imports and reconstruction efforts and the home of nearly 700,000 displaced Iraqis. In the aftermath of the Iraq War, FDI took off again and performance exceeded all expectations in 2004 and 2005. Regional events dictated the FDI inflows, in spite of the country’s seemingly unchanged potential for attracting FDI (Barriers).\\nEven though by 1999 Jordan was well into its economic reform, it was not performing at potential in terms of FDI inflows. Most reforms focused on macroeconomic frameworks (stability of the Jordanian dinar, increasing foreign reserves, liberalizing trade, reducing foreign debt, streamlining the budget, and reducing the budget deficit), rather than microeconomic adjustments to directly enhance the productivity of labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. As a result, the climate necessary for fostering FDI did not emerge during the reform process(Barriers)\\n\\nJordan currently imports 4.7% of it’s goods from the US (CIA). Certain non-tariff barriers impact US exports to Jordan. Jordan selectively imposes sanitary measures on fruits, vegetables, and beef to effectively create non-tariff barriers on imports of these products. Last year Jordan banned the importation of beef and live bovine animals after the BSE in Alabama broke out. \\nToday their exports consist of clothing, fertilizers, potash, phosphates, vegetables, and pharmaceuticals, consisting of $6.521 billion.

In time political unity was followed by important changes in spheres such as religion, language, culture, science, technology, trade and agriculture.  These changes survived the later slow political fragmentation of the region and contributed to the formation of a world which in many ways differed markedly from that of pre-Islamic times.  Very important changes occurred in the agricultural sector at least until 1100 CE and in some areas over a longer period.  Together they are sometimes referred to as the Arab Agricultural Revolution.   \\n\\nAgriculture evolved in three ways:  (1) the technologies for the capture, channeling, lifting, storage and spreading of irrigation water, nearly all inherited from the ancient world, were diffused much more widely than in ancient times and used  more intensively, sometimes in new combinations;  (2)  crops, nearly all of which originated outside the Islamic world, only a few of which had already appeared in limited areas in the lands conquered by the Arabs, were carried throughout the Islamic world and most were grown wherever soil, water and climate would allow their cultivation;  and (3) the improvements in irrigation combined with the new crops made much land more productive, including areas which had not previously been cultivated, and increased markedly the productivity agricultural labour by raising yields, introducing crops of higher value, and  using  labour (and land) over longer periods of the year.\\n\\nThe history of irrigation in West Asia appears to go back at least as far as the history of agriculture, and over the millennia which followed many  technologies were invented to control floods, store water, drain marshlands and irrigate cultivated lands.  The diffusion of these, however,  seems to have been spotty, so that in many parts of the ancient world they were  unknown or little used.  Furthermore, the centuries leading up to the rise of Islam saw a marked decline in irrigation in almost all regions the Arabs were to conquer.  This began in the western part of the Roman Empire as population dropped from c. 250 CE onwards, cities shrank, rural life became more insecure, and the money economy almost disappeared.   With the catastrophic Plague of Justinian in the late sixth and seventh centuries decline spread to Byzantium, the Sasanian Empire and the Arabian peninsula;  in some of these regions political decay and  various natural disasters further curtailed irrigated agriculture.  After the collapse of the dam of Ma’rib in the late-6th century, none of the great ancient works of irrigation in the Hadramaut was in operation.  In 626 CE a huge flood on the Tigris and Euphrates could not be contained and destroyed the important Nimrud dam, many other irrigation works, and much agricultural land. \\n\\nAfter the Arab conquests of the 7th and early-8th centuries, and the great movements of peoples across the early Islamic world, the irrigation losses of the late ancient  world were in large measure recovered and important advances were made.   These were based mainly on known technologies which were diffused  more widely, often into areas where they appear to have been unknown, and indeed over virtually all of the Islamic world.  As landowners and farmers found a wider range of possibilities for irrigation available, they could choose those techniques which were best suited to local environments.  Moreover, the greater choice of technologies  allowed for new combinations which could intensify irrigation, extend its duration, and allow its spread into new regions, large and small.  The lengthening of the period of irrigation through a greater part of the year was of special importance  since, as will be seen below, many of the new crops introduced  had originated in tropical regions and required intensive watering through the hot, dry summer months which characterized the climate of most of the Islamic world.   \\n		\\nOf the new crops which were diffused in the early-Islamic world, Andrew Watson has been able to study seventeen.  These include four crops which had already been introduced before the Arab conquests, namely rice, sugar cane, cotton and sorghum.    Their pre-Islamic distribution appears to have been very limited:  it was  confined entirely to the eastern part of the lands to be conquered by the Arabs, and within this large region it was limited to areas with warm winters, a constraint which seems to reflect the incomplete acclimatization of these plants to the cooler, non-tropical  climate of the region.  This acclimatization was to come in the centuries following the Arab conquests. Twelve other crops appear to have been first introduced into the Islamic world after the Arab conquests, many of them from the Indus Valley where they had arrived some centuries earlier and undergone some acclimatization.  These were sour (or Seville) oranges, lemons, limes, bananas, plantains, coconuts, watermelons, spinach, colocasia, eggplants and mangoes.  And finally, one new crop appeared which seems not to have been known anywhere in the pre-Islamic world:  this was  the artichoke, which was probably developed from the cardoon in Islamic times, possibly in the Maghrib.    Though these 18 crops were of varying economic and social importance, they all were diffused very widely across the vast territories of the early-Islamic world, seemingly coming to be grown almost wherever their cultivation was allowed by soil, water and climate.   The wider choice of crops allowed farmers to choose cropping patterns which were more flexible, better adapted to local conditions and more profitable.  \\n\\nThe appearance of the new crops, many of them summer crops in Islamic lands, and the availability of irrigation water in many places over most of the year were responsible for a considerable intensification of agriculture.  In most places in the ancient world rainfed farming yielded one crop every second winter;  during the remainder of the two-year period, the land was fallowed.   With the improvements in irrigation it became possible to produce four or more crops in a two-year period – indeed such results could be obtained in some areas which had never been cultivated or where farming had long been abandoned.   Though such startling changes were not uncommon, it is probably true that in most places the gains were less spectacular – but still of considerable importance.  These improvements in the productivity of both agricultural land and labour were connected  in complex ways to many developments outside the agricultural sector.   Most obviously, they were linked as both cause and effect to demographic increase, to a  marked rise in  urbanization of the early-Islamic world, to the growth in both local and long-distance trade, and to the increasing monetization of both rural and urban economies.  Although these connections are difficult to study in detail, their importance is evident.   Had the Arab agricultural revolution not occurred, the early-Islamic world would have been a very different place.     \\n\\n\\n\\n{{Reflist}}
Despite the wealth of development knowledge, experience, and tools available today, a substantial percentage of software projects fail, often because requirements are not correctly determined and defined at the outset, or are not managed correctly as the project unfolds. To ease the managing software requirements, collaboration between developers and the stakeholder are the key factors for the success of any given project. With the help of collaborating systems such as Wiki System, complexity of the managing development keeps low and effective. This paper examines how Wiki System improves the quality of Managing Software Requirements.

'''HOMOGENIZED DAIRY, THE DEPENDABLE CARDIOTOXIN'''\\nBY Rodney Julian   \\nWhen the “Father of Modern Cardiology,” the eminent physician Dr. Paul Dudley White, graduated from Harvard medical school in 1911, he had never encountered coronary thrombosis. As a practicing physician in Boston, on those rare occasions when a hospital had such a case, he and other physicians from the Boston area would gather to see this rare disease. Today, however, it has become so prevalent, it threatens almost all of us, young and old. So the question is “What happened between 1911 and now to facilitate this change?”\\nMany studies show evidence that cholesterol is the major contributor. Autopsy studies show that in American soldiers from the Vietnam War, 75% had evidence of atherosclerosis and high cholesterol buildup. The average age was 22 years old. It was natural to assume that since cholesterol was almost always present, it must be the leading cause of atherosclerosis. This assumption has continued to today. Many diets prescribed today by physicians or by diet specialists completely eliminate cholesterol.\\n\\nCholesterol is manufactured in our bodies. It is so important to the integrity of the body that all cells contain it. It is found in high concentrations in the brain. In addition to its role in the conduction of nerve impulses, cholesterol has an important structural role, as well as a biochemical role in endocrine production. Cholesterol synthesizes male and female hormones. Without cholesterol, vitamin D, which is required for calcium absorption, would not be synthesized. Bile originates in the liver from used or spent cholesterol and is essential for proper fat digestion. With all this evidence indicating the physiological importance of cholesterol, why would the body keep producing it throughout our evolution if it were eventually going to destroy us? It would seem that the human system takes adequate care of itself. Perhaps, we are not taking care of the system.\\n\\nThe answer to the discrepancy between needing cholesterol for survival and finding it in heart disease victims comes from Dr. Kurt A. Oster, cardiologist. After suffering from two heart attacks, he was inspired to research how the atherosclerotic process worked. He discovered that the enzyme xanthine oxidase (Xo), which is present in cow's milk (as well as the milk of sheep and goats), can be very destructive to heart and arterial tissue when the milk is homogenized. In raw milk, both the fat and Xo are digested in the stomach and small intestines. They are either used or excreted. Xo is found in the liver of many animals, where it breaks down compounds into uric acid waste products. Humans have a natural reservoir of Xo in the liver. One of its chief functions is to destroy used plasmalogen (in the liver only). And there are barriers, which prevent Xo from entering the bloodstream.\\n\\nWhen homogenized milk was introduced in 1932, we started to see increased atherosclerotic damage on a regular basis. Under pressure of 2500 pounds per square inch, at a speed of 600 feet per second, milk is passed through pipes and fine filters. This breaks up the fat particles and puts them in suspension like a foggy mist. The homogenized process encapsulates Xo into tiny fatty substances called liposomes. This protects Xo from stomach acids and allows it to pass through the intestinal walls and into the circulatory system.\\n\\nAt this point, while the liposomes are circulating in the blood, they are slowly burned up as energy fuel, only to expose the hidden core, which is in fact the enzyme xanthine oxidase. This dangerous situation is taking place outside the protection of the liver. Xo and plasmalogen cannot co-exist in one location. The liver, therefore, cannot store plasmalogen. It can only process or destroy it. So now this freshly exposed Xo circulating in the bloodstream, with nothing to stop it, starts to destroy plasmalogen, which makes up 30% of the membrane system in human heart muscle cells. In autopsies of people who died from heart and circulatory disease, plasmalogen was completely missing. Xo was in its place. Arterial inner linings were completely eaten away. The resulting lesions had become hardened by the deposition of minerals. Fatty streaks and cholesterol had surrounded the newly formed plaque by this time.\\n\\nThe appearance of cholesterol created widespread speculation that it was the cause of heart disease and not the result. The Xo process is slow and effectively destructive. Most 10-year-old children who have consumed homogenized milk have some form of atherosclerosis. In the case of American soldiers autopsied after combat fatalities, some had arteries as brittle as clay pipes.\\n\\nThere is a very high correlation between countries that drink homogenized milk and atherosclerosis. In countries where milk is boiled for safety reasons before drinking, Xo is destroyed in the process. However, boiling will rob the milk of vitamins, change its organic structure and convert it to a putrefied mess in the bowel. In children especially, it can lead to constipation, chronic sniffles and colds, and tonsillitis.\\n\\nIt has become trendy for health-conscious people to consume skim or low fat milk, but that only slows down the Xo process slightly. Besides that, low fat milk products will cause someone to gain weight. Farmers feed their pigs skim milk to fatten them up before the slaughter. If you look at commercially prepared homogenized milk in supermarkets, most brands state that vitamin D has been added. Unfortunately, vitamin D enhances Xo activity. Xo is not the only source of atherosclerosis, but it is a major contributor. People looking to improve their diet in a truly healthful manner would be wise to avoid all dairy products, except for those that are raw or cultured without homogenization.\\n\\nThis article was published in the Well Being Journal, Sep/Oct 2003, Vol 12, #5\\nRFJ
Hey there. I believe that the article regarding the benefits and precautions of veganism, or vegetarianism for that matter, misses the boat by citing mortality studies while failing to address quality of life issues. After all, it is not just the years in your life, but also the life in your years, that matter.  I would challenge someone to seek out more information on studies that might address the relative health of people, and not simply look at their ages at time of death. A meat eater may die at 90, but if he has survived two heart attacks, a bout with cancer, and been bedridden for 8 years, his quality of life is vastly different from a vegan who dies at 90 but was not ill, lived independently and could engage with family and friends until very near the end of life.[[User:Ginquiry|Ginquiry]] ([[User talk:Ginquiry|talk]]) 19:53, 1 March 2008 (UTC)

Matthew John St. Onge is known throughout his fiefdom as "The Stonge".  His coming was foretold by nearly every recorded civilization known throughout history.  \\n\\nApparently, there was an era of unforetold St. Onge power, that was initially quelled, but later again rose to power as it is today. The St. Onge bloodline has been found to be essential to the existence of several species today. Due to the extremely high white blood cell count found in all St. Onge blood, the St. Onge carrier is able to pass off some of thier white blood cells to assist creatures/humans with a low white blood cell count. Therefore, enhancing thier immune system, and allowing thier bodies to have disease fighting white blood cells. This common St. Onge trait is also being researched to help victims with the pandemic AIDS virus.
== National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) ==\\nThe National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) [www.ncchc.org] is an independent, [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to improving the quality of care in the jails, prisons, and juvenile detention and confinement facilities in the United States. \\n\\nNCCHC's origins date to the early 1970s, when an [[American Medical Association]] study of jails found inadequate, disorganized health services and a lack of national standards. In collaboration with other organizations, the AMA established a program that in the early 1980s became the NCCHC, which is now supported by the major national organizations representing the fields of health, law, and corrections. It sets standards, provides education and technical assistance, and certifies correctional health professionals.  NCCHC’s leadership in setting standards for health services and improving health care in correctional facilities is widely recognized, affecting over 11 million people who are released from correctional facilities each year. The standards have helped the nation’s correctional and detention facilities improve the health of their inmates and the communities to which they return; increase the efficiency of their health services delivery; and strengthen their organizational effectiveness.

Algal Fuel, \\noil or third generation biofuel, is a biofuel from algae. (pond Scum etc) Compared with second generation biofuels, algae are high-yield high-cost (30 times more energy per acre than terrestrial crops) feedstocks to produce biofuels.\\n\\nAlgal fuels do not impact fresh water resources.\\n   [Http://AlgaeFuel.WS]\\nWith the record oil price increases since 2003, competing demands between foods and other biofuel sources and the world food crisis, there is much interest in algaculture (farming algae) for making vegetable oil, biodiesel, bioethanol, biogasoline, biomethanol, biobutanol and other biofuels.\\n\\nThe production of biofuels to replace oil and natural gas is in active development, focusing on the use of cheap organic matter (usually cellulose, agricultural and sewage waste) in the efficient production of liquid and gas biofuels which yield high net energy gain. One advantage of many biofuels over most other fuel types is that they are biodegradable, and so relatively harmless to the environment if spilled.\\n\\nThe United States Department of Energy estimates that if algae fuel replaced all the petroleum fuel in the United States, it would require 15,000 square miles (38,849 square kilometers), which is a few thousand square miles larger than Maryland, or 1.3 Belgiums.

A comparison of the images shows that where vegetation is dense, temperatures are cooler.\\n  |text= An '''[[urban heat island]]''' ('''UHI''') is a [[metropolitan area]] which is significantly warmer than its surrounding [[rural area]]s. The temperature difference usually is larger at night than during the day, and is most apparent when winds are weak. Seasonally, UHI is seen during both summer and winter. The main cause of the urban heat island is modification of the land surface by urban development which uses materials which effectively retain heat. Waste heat generated by energy usage is a secondary contributor. As a population centre grows, it tends to expand its area, and increase in its average temperature.\\n\\nMonthly [[precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]] is greater downwind of cities, partially due to the UHI.  Increases in heat within urban centres increases the length of [[growing season]]s, and decreases the occurrence of weak [[tornado]]es. The UHI decreases [[air quality]] by increasing the production of pollutants such as [[ozone]], and decreases water quality as warmer waters flow into area streams, which stresses their ecosystems. Despite concerns raised about its possible contribution to global warming, comparisons between urban and rural areas show that the urban heat island effects have little influence on global mean temperature trends.\\n\\nUHIs have the potential to directly influence the health and welfare of urban residents. As UHIs are characterized by increased temperature, they can potentially increase the magnitude and duration of heat waves within cities. Research has found that the mortality rate during a heat wave increases exponentially with the maximum temperature, an effect that is exacerbated by the UHI. The nighttime effect of UHIs can be particularly harmful during a heat wave, as it deprives urban residents of the cool relief found in rural areas during the night\\n\\nNot all cities have a distinct UHI. Mitigation of the urban heat island effect can be accomplished through the use of [[green roof]]s and the use of lighter-coloured surfaces in urban areas, which reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat.\\n  |link=Urban heat island\\n}}
Triple Bottom Line In Accounting /Reporting\\nThe TBL is an accounting framework that incorporates three dimensions of performance: social, environmental and financial. This differs from traditional reporting frameworks as it includes ecological (or environmental) and social measures that can be difficult to assign appropriate means of measurement. The TBL dimensions are also commonly called the three Ps: people, planet and profits. \\nWhere it comes from?\\nWith the ratification of the United Nations and ICLEI TBL standard for urban and community accounting in early 2007, this became the dominant approach to public sector full cost accounting\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bottom_line\\nWhy used?\\nThe application of the TBL by businesses, nonprofits and governments are motivated by the principles of economic, environmental and social sustainability, but differ with regard to the way they measure the three categories of outcomes.

Network and Application Visibility \\nAs infrastructures become increasingly complex, organizations find significant gaps in their ability to monitor the performance of critical applications, and to gain actionable information to optimize application delivery. Application Visibility refers to the ability to understand an application’s operation dynamics. This include performance, security, availability, usage pattern, etc. Apparently, IT management team can most efficiently manage application delivery with such information.\\n\\nAccording to “The Value of Network and Application Visibility” written by Aberdeen group in 2008, Best-in-Class organizations which implemented application visibility tools reported: \\n\\n\\n120% average improvement in application availability \\n54% average improvement in Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) \\n85% success rate in preventing issues with application performance before end-user are impacted. \\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, traditional IT monitoring solutions are not effective when it comes to application level visibility, as they were mostly designed for network monitoring on device or TCP/UDP level. The techniques they used were typically Syslog, SNMP, and Flow (Netflow, sFlow). Today a wide variety of applications run in an enterprise environment. These include not only business critical applications such as SAP/Oracle, communication service such as VoIP, but also recreational applications like P2P file sharing, IM, and so on. Moreover Cloud Computing and SaaS (Software as a Service) are also driving applications to be webified and delivered from external providers. Many of these applications share common characteristics at network level, e.g. using TCP and same port number. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn this situation, only a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) solution is capable to provide accurate information about application traffic type and derive performance metrics such as response time. A DPI solution typically classifies network traffic into application types by looking deeply into every packet’s content (application header & payload) while doing wire-speed packet forwarding. It is an essential technology when it comes to providing complete Application Visibility.

TRANS FAT AND HEALTH\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\nTrans Fat and Health\\n\\nHeart disease and obersity are increasing in frequency amongst young people in all countries. Some blame this on a lack of exercise and the propensity to eat junk food. Although being a couch potato is a major contributing factor, the greatest contributor to obersity is the consumption  of trans fats. Trans fat is created by adding hydrogen to plant oils to crease “unsaturated fats”. This gives the plant oils a higher melting temperature (which helps with baking) and a longer shelf life, making them more commercially viable. Since no trans fat is found in nature. It is not beneficial to our health. In fact, it increases our cholesterol level and thereby increases the risk of heart disease.\\nAdding hydrogen to fat was pioneered by Paul Sabatier, and he earned a Nobel Prize for his efforts Proctor & Gamble, a U.S company, was the first to market a commercial product with unsaturated fat in 1911 called Crisco Shortening.\\nThe product became hugely popular after they distributed a free cookbook filled with recipes calling for Crisco Shortening. The products was cheap, and it was also said to be healthier than saturated fats like butter.\\nIt will untill 1987 that critics began to speak out against trans fat. In 1994, it was estimated that over 30,000 people died of heart disease associated with trans fats. Crisco, facing a possible ban on their Shortening, had a change of heart and made an effort to remove trans fats from their products. Last years, over 12,5 million Americans were diagnosed with heart disease, and more than 500,000 died.\\nThe greatest influence trans fat has on the body is an increase in the risk of heart disease. A 1976 study of 120,000 nurses showed that for every 2% increase in trans fat consumed, the risk of heart disease doubled. Heart disease is not the only negative health effect, diabetes, obesity, liver dysfunction and infertility go hand in hand with trans fat consumption. A six-year experiment on monkeys found that, even though all monkeys consumed the same number of calories per day, monkeys who are trans fats gained 7,2% of their body weight. Monkeys who consumed no trans fat only gained 1,8% of their body weight.\\nAll food labels are required to show amounts of trans fat. Try to choose products with lower amounts of fat. Use alternate fats like monosaturated and polyunsaturated fats (olive, canola, soy bean, corn and sunflower oils) Avoid foods high in trans fats such as cookies, cakes and chips if you want to stay in shape.

HRLLP Disease - \\n\\nHrllp is a very serious disease. If ignored it can cause serious damage to the brain or large toe. The disease is very rare yet is becoming more common as time progresses. Doctors are unsure of the cause, but they do know it is highly contagious because of the yungea chemical released in the air. Symptoms of the disease include insomnia, random thoughts, uneasy appearances in public and the most common of them all, randomly saying or typing "hrllp." What does this mean? No one knows, but if the disease is not taken care of quickly the disease can be deadly.

The Giacomini Wetlands area is a semi-historical recreation of wetlands at the southern end of Tomales Bay, California. This is a project enacted by the Point Reyes National Seashore, the Point Reyes National Seashore Association (PRNSA) and various volunteer groups. Large parts of the funding came from PRNSA fundraising and from CALTRANS wetlands mitigation funds.\\n\\nThe project created over 550 acres of tidal and freshwater wetland- up to 12% of California's total saltwater wetland habitat. The initial flooding of the wetlands occurred on October 25, 2008. Since then sevral species of duck and shorebird have begun to visit the wetlands, seasonally and on a yearlong basis. The habitat has shifted from largely non-native vegetation left over from its time as a levied off cow pastures to native and non native salt water habitat.

Thus, manufacturers may expect consumers to avoid retail purchases, particularly large-ticket items that require financing. Manufacturers may pare down inventories to reduce overhead or delay investing in new projects and facilities. Likewise, banks can anticipate a decrease in lending activity, mortgage applications and credit card use. When faced with a down-trending index, the government has a variety of options, such as issuing a tax rebate or taking other fiscal or monetary action to stimulate the economy.\\n\\nConversely, a rising trend in consumer confidence indicates improvements in consumer buying patterns. Manufacturers can increase production and hiring. Banks can expect increased demand for credit. Builders can prepare for a rise in home construction, and government can anticipate improved tax revenues based on the increase in [[consumer spending]].\\n\\n== Consumer-demand surveys versus consumer-confidence and -sentiment surveys ==\\nConsumer-demand surveys are interview-based statistical surveys that measure the percentage of households that will buy a car, white goods, PCs, TVs, home furnishings, kitchenware, or toys in, for example, the next three-month period. The surveys provide a percentage of those who will purchase more, less, or the same amount of food and clothing in the next three months than in the corresponding period the year before. If you ask people about their purchasing behavior within the coming six or 12 months, there will be more of those who "hope to be able to buy", than if consumers are asked about what they will purchase in the next three months. The shorter the time spans, the closer to actual behavior.\\n\\nConsumer confidence and sentiment surveys measure how people are doing financially, how they look at the overall economy of the country or business conditions in the country, if they think that the government is doing a good or a poor job and if people think that it is a good or a bad time to buy a car or to buy or sell a house.\\n\\nWhen the business cycle is fairly stable, consumer demand surveys and consumer confidence and sentiment indices will often correlate closely and indicate the same direction of the economy, but in times with a high degree of economic or political uncertainty or during a prolonged crisis, the two types of consumer surveys might differ significantly. In 2011, confidence and sentiment surveys went up from March to April, while consumer demand surveys dropped significantly. In August 2011, the confidence and sentiment surveys dropped significantly and stayed low during September and October, while consumer demand surveys showed resilience, a development confirmed later by official statistics.\\n\\nA 2022 study found that the consumer confidence index always plays a positive and statistically significant function in the development of consumption.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chemistry |first=University of |last2=Prague |first2=Technology |title=Happy people spend less on consumption, study suggests |url=https://phys.org/news/2022-12-happy-people-consumption.html |access-date=2022-12-26 |website=phys.org |language=en}}</ref>\\n\\n== In Canada ==\\n[[Conference Board of Canada|The Conference Board of Canada's]] index of consumer confidence has been ongoing since 1980. It is constructed from responses to four attitudinal questions posed to a random sample of Canadian households. Those surveyed are asked to give their views about their households' current and expected financial positions and the short-term employment outlook. They are also asked to assess whether now is a good or a bad time to make a major purchase, such as a house, car or other big-ticket items.\\n\\n== In Indonesia ==\\nConsumer Survey-Bank Indonesia (CS-BI) is a monthly survey that has been conducted since October 1999 by [[Bank Indonesia]].<ref name="OECD-INDO-CCI">{{cite web\\n  | url = http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/22/30/43813366.pdf\\n  | title = BANK INDONESIA – CONSUMER SURVEY\\n  | publisher = Bank Indonesia\\n  | author1 = Nurcahyo Heru Prasetyo | author2 = Ririn Yuliatiningsih\\n  | access-date = 2011-02-26\\n}}</ref> The survey represents the consumer confidence about the overall economic condition, general price level, household income, and consumption plans three and six months ahead.

At a [[significance level]] of 99%, the survey has a [[sampling error]] of 2%. Data canvassing run through interviews by phone and direct visits in particular cities that is based on rotational system. The Balance Score Method (net balance + 100) has been adopted to construct the index, where the index above 100 points indicates optimism (positive responses) and vice versa. The consumer confidence index (CCI), is an average of the current economic condition index (CECI) and consumer expectation index (CEI).\\n\\n=== Other indexes ===\\n[[Danareksa]] conducts a monthly consumer survey to produce the Consumer Confidence Index.<ref>{{cite web|last=Danareksa|first=Research Institute|title=Consumer Confidence Index|date=31 October 2007|url=http://danareksaresearch.wordpress.com/consumer-confidence/|publisher=Danareksa|access-date=26 February 2011}}</ref>\\n\\n== In the Republic of Ireland ==\\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[KBC Bank Ireland]] (formerly IIB Bank) and the [[Economic and Social Research Institute]] (a think-tank) have published a monthly consumer sentiment index since January 1996.<ref name="ESRI">{{cite web\\n  | url = http://www.esri.ie/irish_economy/consumer_sentiment/\\n  | title = Consumer Sentiment\\n  | publisher = [[Economic and Social Research Institute]]\\n  | access-date = 2009-02-24\\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080129194655/http://www.esri.ie/irish_economy/consumer_sentiment/\\n  | archive-date = 29 January 2008\\n  }}</ref>\\n\\n== In the United States ==\\n[[File:U.S. Consumer Confidence Index.png|thumb|US consumer confidence index 1966–2012{{Update inline|date=August 2021}}]]\\n\\nIn the United States, [[The Conference Board]], an independent [[Economics|economic]] research organization, issues monthly measures of consumer confidence based on 5,000 households.

{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --> This is all what I larned in my Astrobiology!!hehehe!! (>_<)\\nHi my name is Ashley,but my friends just call me Ash...I have been asking my teacher as my school ''What is Astrobiology?,'' but i never got the correct answers until now. Astrobiology is the study of the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of extraterrestrial life. This interdisciplinary field encompasses the search for habitable environments in our Solar System and habitable planets outside our Solar System, the search for evidence of prebiotic chemistry, laboratory and field research into the origins and early evolution of life on Earth, and studies of the potential for life to adapt to challenges on Earth and in outer space. Astrobiology addresses the question of whether life exists beyond Earth, and how humans can detect it if it does.[2] (The term exobiology is similar but more specific — it covers the search for life beyond Earth, and the effects of extraterrestrial environments on living things.)\\n\\nAstrobiology makes use of physics, chemistry, astronomy, biology, molecular biology, ecology, planetary science, geography, and geology to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize biospheres that might be different from the biosphere on Earth. Astrobiology concerns itself with interpretation of existing scientific data; given more detailed and reliable data from other parts of the universe, the roots of astrobiology itself—physics, chemistry and biology—may have their theoretical bases challenged. Although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories.\\n\\nEarth is the only place in the universe known to harbor life.[6][7] However, recent advances in planetary science have changed fundamental assumptions about the possibility of life in the universe, raising the estimates of habitable zones around other stars and the search for extraterrestrial microbial life.[8] The possibility of life on Mars, either currently or in the past, is an active area of research.\\n\\nNASA’s Astrobiology Program addresses three fundamental questions: How does life begin and evolve? Is there life beyond Earth and, if so, how can we detect it? What is the future of life on Earth and in the universe? In striving to answer these questions and improve understanding of biological, planetary, and cosmic phenomena and relationships among them, experts in astronomy and astrophysics, Earth and planetary sciences, microbiology and evolutionary biology, cosmochemistry, and other relevant disciplines are participating in astrobiology research and helping to advance the enterprise of space exploration.\\n\\nThe Astrobiology Program has four elements: the NASA Astrobiology Institute, Exobiology and Evolutionary Biology, Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets, and Astrobiology Science and Technology Instrument Development. NASA established the Astrobiology Program in 1996. However, NASA studies in the field of exobiology – a predecessor to astrobiology – date back to the beginning of the U.S. space program.\\n\\nNASA funded its first exobiology project in 1959 and established an Exobiology Program in 1960. NASA’s Viking missions to Mars, launched in 1976, included three biology experiments designed to look for possible signs of life. In the 21st century, astrobiology is a focus of a growing number of NASA solar system exploration missions. As noted above, exobiology research is now an element of the Astrobiology Program. (For more information on the history of NASA’s Astrobiology Program, see The Living Universe: NASA and the Development of Astrobiology, by Steven J. Dick and James E. Strick, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, NJ, 2004.)\\n\\nAstrobiology is a cross-cutting theme in all of NASA’s space science endeavors, knitting together research in astrophysics, earth science, and heliophysics as well as planetary science. NASA’s Astrobiology Roadmap, prepared in consultation with the scientific community, outlines multiple pathways for research and exploration and indicates how they might be prioritized and coordinated. The Astrobiology Program also solicits advice from the Space Studies Board of the National Research Council (see publications page).\\n\\nThe Astrobiology Program is managed by the Planetary Science Division of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. Mary Voytek is Senior Scientist for Astrobiology in the Planetary Science Division. The Astrobiology Program is closely coordinated with NASA’s Mars Exploration and Planetary Protection Programs.\\n\\nFocus Areas for Astrobiology\\n\\nInner Solar System - Inner solar system bodies are rocky, unlike the gas and water giant planets of the outer solar system. Rocky planets are thought to have formed from the accretion of dust into “planetesimals,” the planetesimals into proto-planets and finally the proto-planets into planets. Many details of this sequence are still unknown, including the composition of the planetesimals. Equally obscure are the histories of the inner solar system worlds: although Venus, the Earth, and Mars are similar to one another, they have evolved in highly distinct ways. We now know that Mars once had water on its surface, and there are tantalizing hints that Venus might have too. Yet only the Earth is currently known to be habitable. Missions currently in operation, development and planning will greatly increase our knowledge of the forces driving planetary habitability and evolution.\\n\\n    Jupiter's moon EuropaFalse color composite of the Minos Linea region on Jupiter's moon Europa. \\n\\nOuter Solar System - The giant planets of the outer solar system—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—and their rings and moons and the ice dwarfs (e.g., Pluto, Charon, Sedna) beyond them hold many clues to the origin and evolution of our solar system as well as providing exciting opportunities for the search for habitable environments. Moreover, an understanding of the formation and dynamics of the giant planets will aid greatly in understanding the nature of extra-solar planetary systems.\\n\\nSmall Bodies of the Solar System - The small bodies in the solar system include comets, asteroids, the objects in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort cloud, small planetary satellites, Triton, Pluto, Charon, and interplanetary dust. As some of these objects are believed to be minimally altered from their state in the young solar nebula from which the planets formed, overall they may provide a window into the early history of the solar system through which insights about the process of planet formation may be drawn.\\nAstrobiology in Space Exploration Missions \\nAstrobiology is a cross-cutting theme in all of NASA’s space science endeavors, knitting together research in astrophysics, earth science, and heliophysics as well as planetary science. NASA’s Astrobiology Roadmap, prepared in consultation with the scientific community, outlines multiple possible pathways for research and exploration. The Astrobiology Program already plays a role in many of NASA’s solar system exploration initiatives, and astrobiology is a primary focus of a growing number of upcoming exploration missions.\\n\\nFor example, Phoenix Mars polar-lander mission, launched in August 2007, is designed to conduct in-situ sampling and analysis of Martian surface and subsurface soil and ice. The science objectives of the Phoenix Mars mission are to study the history of water on Mars in all of its phases, search for evidence of habitable zones on Mars and assess the potential for life in the ice-soil boundary of the Martian arctic region. A primary goal of NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory mission planned for launch in 2009 is to determine whether life ever arose on Mars. The Astrobiology Science Laboratory mission proposed as a successor to MSL will be dedicated to astrobiology research on Mars. Astrobiology will play a prominent role in a Mars Sample Return mission as well.\\n\\nThe ASTEP Program sponsors terrestrial field testing of instruments and equipment being developed for MSL and other future planetary missions. The ASTID Program supports the development of instruments for future missions as well. For instance, ASTID funding contributed to the development of the Urey Mars Organic and Oxidant Detector for the European Space Agency’s ExoMars mission. Concepts under consideration for missions to Jupiter’s moon Europa also feature astrobiological investigations.\\n\\nAt the same time that astrobiology plays a key role in many solar system exploration missions, astrobiologists also make extensive use of data produced by other space science projects to study topics such as prebiotic chemistry in interstellar space, the formation of habitable planets, and extraterrestrial environments where prebiotic chemistry or life may have occurred. These projects include the Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer Space Telescope, and ground-based telescopes around the world at facilities such as the Keck Observatory.\\n\\nThe Astrobiology Program is managed by the Planetary Science Division of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. The Astrobiology Program is closely coordinated with NASA’s Mars Exploration and Planetary Protection Programs.\\n\\nBuilding the Tools for Astrobiology's Future\\n\\nThe NASA Astrobiology program has selected eight new projects for funding under the Astrobiology Science and Technology for Instrument Development Program (ASTID). The ASTID program is an essential component in furthering NASA's astrobiology goals, and provides funding for new instruments that can be used in space missions as well as Earth-based research projects.\\n\\nASTID projects turn novel concepts into laboratory instruments that will open new areas of study and the development of astrobiology mission concepts and payloads for future missions.\\n\\nFunding from the ASTID program has provided technologies like the Urey Mars Organic and Oxidant Detector for Europe's ExoMars mission, and the Magneto-Optical Phase Enantiomeric Detector (MOPED), which could help in the search for life beyond Earth by detecting chiral biomarkers. A recent addition to the ASTID program is the development of small astrobiology payloads that can fly on small satellites and lunar missions.\\n\\nThese suitcase-sized payloads include missions like the recent O/OREOS satellite in Earth orbit, and can provide significant science return on a relatively small investment.
Spatial opacity\\n\\nSpatial opacity is everything that interrupts any type of spatial flows. Spatial opacity can be natural (mountains, hills, lakes, rivers and so on) and not natural (traffic lights, intersections, doors and so on). Spatial opacity surrounds us and we can not escape from it which and it is slowing us down.\\n\\nIn order to think about spatial opacity (not natural) you have to imagine space as a connected network where everything is connected with each other. From Tobler's first law of Geography we know that close things are more related than distant things. Nowadays every single place on earth can be reached with different degrees of difficulty.\\n\\nSpatial Opacity in our daily lives:\\n\\nBy getting up in the morning we normally face our first spatial opacity by opening the bathroom door, going donwstairs (taking the stairs). By taking the car we have to follow the road network we are given by nature (natural opacity) and by the way roads have been built (non natural). Slower cars in front of us, intersections, traffic lights everything slows us down and is part of the spatial opacity.\\n\\n\\n\\nCourses:\\n\\nThe main input from the courses is a very theoretical overview of the material. Depending on the subject, you may get some applied examples on how the theory matches real examples. \\nThe courses include a lot of training in statistics as well as approaches to spatial planning with computer support (GIS). All courses are presented with Powerpoint support and in the English language. \\nMany courses treat various policy issues on spatial planning of the European Union as well as political issues within the different EU Member States. In addition to that, there are some courses about sustainability in terms of spatial planning. \\nMost of the courses are related to the European Union and do not necessarily treat spatial planning of non-EU member States.
<ref>TN COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT ORGANIZATION (TCEO)</ref>\\n\\nTN Community Empowerment Organization was established in January 2008 to empower communities in Dodoma to fight against poverty and diseases, especially beggars and to establish projects for the purpose of raising funds to help vulnerable persons. The organization is governed by a board of governors and day to day management is under the Managing Director.\\nThe vision is to see marginalized people learn to provide for themselves without begging from other people.  So in this endeavor TCEO will mobilize human, material and financial resources and use them efficiently and effectively for promoting the welfare of beggars, street children, and the disabled.\\nThe main cause of marginalization is poverty. Tanzania is among the poorest countries of the world, with a per capital income of less than US $ 300 per day. Most of her people live below the internationally defined poverty line of US 2 per day. It is in this environment that TCEO is planning to participate to solve the problems of vulnerable persons.\\nAlso Tanzania is among the countries with the highest number of AIDS patients. The Government has put in place an enabling environment deal with the AIDS pandemic, where the Central Government, local governments, NGO, CBO, FBO, donors, firms and individuals work together in various ways to combat the pandemic. These efforts are coordinated by TACAIDS.\\nPoverty and HIV/AIDS contribute greatly in creating vulnerable persons. This in a country that is credited for being the most peaceful and democratic in the turbulent Great Lakes region, that has held general elections regularly at intervals of five years  since 1961. The country is expected to be a middle income country by 2025 characterized by quality life; a strong, growing and competitive economy; good governance; an educated and learning population; and peace, unity and solidarity.\\nThe economy of Tanzania has been growing at around 7 per cent per year since 2002, the fastest growing sectors being mining, construction, and finance. Inflation has been below 5 % between 1999 and 2006, and began to increase to 7% in 2007 and jumped to 13. 3% per cent during the year ending February 2009.\\nPoverty is broadly defined as a state of deprivation, denial of decent life, which includes exclusion, isolation, and vulnerability. Other dimensions of poverty are income poverty and food poverty. The Government has come up with many poverty reduction strategies, the most recent one being The National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (NSGRP) popularly known as Mpango wa Kukuza Uchumi na Kuondoa Umaskini Tanzania (MKUKUTA). This is an area which TCEO \\nEstablishment, Membership and Management\\nThe TN Community Empowerment Organization is a non- government, not for profit community based organization established in January 2008 to advocate a for  improvement of standard of living, through the economic and social  development of disadvantaged and  marginalized groups, especially orphans, street children, drug addicts, in Dodoma. TCEO’s intervention will be in areas of conservation of the environment, health and will focus on the development of women. TCEO aims at empowering disadvantaged and marginalized groups by enabling them to conceive and implement projects for their own welfare. \\nMembership to the organization is open to anyone who agrees with the terms and conditions of membership, and is truly sympathetic to the cause of the marginalized groups in the society, and agrees with the provisions of articles and memorandum if association.\\nThe organization is led by a Board of Governors but day to day management is under the Managing Director. He is assisted by the Chief Finance officer. These officers are appointed by the Board of Governors and their tenure of office is at the discretion of the Board of Governors.  \\n1.2 Objectives\\nThe causes of, and failure by society to take appropriate care for orphans, street children, beggars and  drug addicts; can be directly associated to poverty.\\nTCEO will deal with some aspects of poverty alleviation. Consequently the main  objectives of TCEO) are: \\nTo develop managerial, human and financial capacities of social based organizations to plan and implement projects and programmes for the marginalized.\\nTo implement programmes for the protection and conservation of the environment that is aimed at helping disadvantaged groups\\nTo advocate and lobby for development programmes for the marginalized.\\nTo develop capacities for disadvantaged groups to conceive ideas and programmes for their own development\\nTo undertake income generating activities that will generate funds to finance programmes and activities for marginalized people.\\nTo establish a financial scheme that will provide cheap loans to the disadvantaged.\\nTo identify development potentials in Tanzania that can be used by the disadvantaged themselves for their development \\n1.3 Vision and Mission\\nVision: Marginalized people are empowered to provide for themselves the basic needs of life	\\nMission: To mobilize human, material and financial resources and use them efficiently and effectively for promoting the welfare of beggars, street children, the disabled, drug addicts.\\n1.4 Core Values:\\nResponsibility: \\nThe organization will show responsibility in dealing with stake holders and in the management of human, material financial resources at its disposal.\\nTransparency\\nThe organization will be transparent in all dealings, The public will have access to the accounts of  the  organization upon request.\\nDedication\\nThe organization is dedicated to the causes of the marginalized people and will strive to cultivate and promote dedication for all staff.\\n\\n1.5 Board of Governors and Trustees\\nTN Community Empowerment Organization (TCEO) was established and registered on the 13thMarch 2008 with registration number OONGO/0437. The head office is located in the heart of the business district in CCT building Dodoma, on the second floor, room no 28.  \\nAccording to the constitution of  TCEO, the organization has a Board of Governors consisting of 5 to 7 persons drawn from a list of reputable institutions. It has a chair person and a secretary to the board. Other members of the board are Joseph Mwalugelo, Aaron Oberd, Matilda Kitali and Mwambene Willie James. Board of Governors reports to the members Assembly.. Currently the chairperson is a retired bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Tanzania, (ELCT) Dr. Peter  Mwamasika. Also it has a board of trustees. The current trustees are Rev Dr. Mtaita who is the Secretary General of the Christian Council of Tanzania, Rev Eng Anord S. Kileo, and Rev Kuwayawaya S.Kuwayawaya.  \\nManagement of TCEO is under a Managing Director, assisted by the Chief Finance Officer. \\n2.	MARGINALISED PEOPLE, THE FOCUS OF TCEO\\n2.1 Vulnerable Persons\\nPeople are made venerable by being no body to take care of them when they are in need. This happens, in the case of children when both parents die. Also it happens in the case of old people when they can not fend for themselves and have nobody to help them.  Malaria is the number one killer in Tanzania, but HIV/AIDS has received most attention because it is a killer disease that although it is relatively new, it has had devastating effects on families. In many instances has caused death of both parents, leaving children as orphans.\\nMost vulnerable children (MVC) are those who because of lack of protection by parents or family members are exposed to life threatening risks of various types. \\nStudies have shown these orphans are more vulnerable to sickness, malnutrition, physical maltreatment, illiteracy, unemployment, lost of inheritance, forced migration, homelessness, crime and increased exposure to HIV/AIDS.\\nAn understanding of the causes and the magnitude of the problems requires, first of all, a comprehension of the social –economic situation of Tanzania, especially poverty. All these problems are associated with or are aggravated by, lack of resources. Tanzania is rich in natural resources, has a youthful population, and yet it is ranked among the poorest nations of the world. She lacks resources to feed her people and this leaves them vulnerable to diseases, and lacks resources to treat her people once they fall sick.\\nHIV/AIDS has been studied extensively and efforts to confront the problems are well coordinated by the Tanzania Commission on Aids (TACAIDS). The government and development partners have made significant investments to deal with the problem. The situation is complex and needs considerable human, material and financial resources to solve it, over a long period of time. The Government of Tanzania has realized the complexity of the problem and has seen that it requires the combined efforts of the various stake holders. TCEO is responding to Government’s call upon CSO, NGS, FBA to help in tackling the problem.\\nA good understanding of the country’s social and economic background, of the dimensions of poverty, and of the genesis and seriousness of HIV/AIDS is required in order to find a place and a way to intervene.\\n3. SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC BACHKGROUND\\n3.1 Political and Social Environment\\nTanzania is a multiparty democracy since the passage of the Political Parties Act, 1992 by Parliament in June 1992. Presidential, general and local government elections are held regularly at five-year intervals since independence in 1961. The last local government elections were held in  October 2009 and presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for October 2010.\\nThe country is enjoying a fairly prolonged peace. Until November 2009 There was  considerable political tension prevailing  in Zanzibar between the two dominanant political parties – the ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM) and the Civic United Front (CUF) , but the leaders of the two parties in Zanzibar got together and decided to work together for the benefit of the country.\\nTanzania has a system of governance that respects the rule of law and protects human rights: a multiparty democracy that devolves power to local authorities and upholds accountability, transparency and ethical behavior in the conduct of public affairs, freedom of lawful association and worship. This is enshrined in the 1977 Constitution as amended from time to time. \\nAccording to the 2002 population census 51.1% of the people of Tanzania are female. s such they are an important source of manpower and target for economic and social development. There is a political will to involve women in every aspect and at every level of economic and social activity. The Vision statement emphasizes gender balance in the ownership and exploitation of national resources and equity in the distribution of economic gains.\\nEvery year the Government publishes a three-year rolling Medium Term Development Plan (MTP) to guide all the stakeholders in the preparation of strategies for implementation of the Vision. The National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (NSGRP) popularly known as Mpango wa Kukuza Uchumi na Kuondoa Umaskini Tanzania (MKUKUTA) is the strategic framework for implementation of the MTP, involving the Government, the donors, civil society organisations and the private sector.\\nOther strategies such as the Mpango wa Kurasimisha Rasimali na Biashara za wanyonge Tanzania (MKURABITA), the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the Mini Tiger Plan address specific issues or areas of development contributing to the attainment of the Vision goals. \\n3.2 Economic Environment\\nAccording to the Monetary Policy Statement issued by the Bank of Tanzania’s in February 2009, Tanzania’s economy grew by 7.5% in 2008, compared to an average 7% over the previous seven years. This is an achievement largely attributed to the successful economic reforms initiated in the mid-1980s. The fastest growing sectors include mining (15.7%), construction (11.4%), finance (9.8%), transport and communications (8.3%), manufacturing (8.2%) and trade (8.0%).\\nBy 1999 the double-digit inflation of the preceding decade had been successfully contained below 5%. According to the Bureau of Statistics the rate jumped to 7% in 2007 and 13.3% during the year ending February 2009, largely fuelled by an 18.6% increase in food prices during 2008 when other consumer commodity prices rose by a very moderate 4.9%. \\nThe global financial meltdown that started in the United states in September 2008 having big negative impact on Tanzania’s export and tourism sectors. The mainstay of Tanzania’s economy is agriculture, most of which is rainfed. It suffers from vagaries of weather. The global climate change is expected to impact negatively on Tanzania’s economy.\\nTanzania sees itself as a middle income country by 2025, as is envisioned in the National Vision 2025 promulgated in 1999 the country is expected to have:\\nQuality life;\\nA strong, growing and competitive economy;\\nGood governance;\\nAn educated and learning population; and\\nPeace, unity and solidarity.\\nVision 2025 states as its primary mission the eradication of poverty and protection of the economic and social rights of all citizens irrespective of their sex, race or faith. The role of the state, as set in the Country’s Constitution, laws and policies is to protect all members in society.\\n. POVERTY, AIDS AND STREET CHILDREN\\nThe main causes of marginalization are to be found in poverty. Tanzania is among the poorest countries of the world. The organization will therefore address itself with issues of aids and street  children, but they are all grounded in poverty. In dealing with these issues the organization will be led by national policies on poverty, aids and street children. \\n4.1 Poverty Reduction Strategy in Tanzania\\nThe definition of poverty is complex, multi-dimensional, wide scoped and dynamic. However, poverty is broadly defined as a state of deprivation, denial of decent life, which includes exclusion, isolation, and vulnerability. Other dimensions of poverty are income poverty and food poverty. Poverty at its broadest level can be defined as a state of deprivation prohibitive of decent human life. This is caused by lack of resources and capacities to acquire basic human needs as seen in many, but often mutually reinforcing parameters. These include malnutrition, ignorance, prevalence of diseases, squalid surroundings, high infant, child and maternal mortality, low life expectancy, low per capita income, poor quality housing, inadequate clothing, low technological utilization, environmental degradation, unemployment, rural urban migration and poor communication.\\nThe Government of Tanzania took steps aimed at reducing poverty immediately after poverty was identified as one of the three major enemies for our country. The other two enemies identified during that time were diseases and ignorance. However, of late some other problems have mushroomed, these are, namely: environmental degradation; rural-urban migration; over crowding in urban areas; high population growth that is not commensurate to economic growth; HIV/AIDS; gender inequality; income inequalities; etc.  \\nJust after independence, the Government put in place some public policies and measures to fight those three enemies. Education programmes were put in place to fight ignorance, both primary and adult education got highest priority. Secondary and tertiary education was also given a deserving attention. Health programmes were put in place to fight diseases. Basic health care, Mother and Child Health programmes, nutritional programmes were all promoted and strengthened for purposes of child survival, growth and development; child and maternal protection; disease prevention and cure. \\nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper in Africa and the rest of the developing world in general and Tanzania in particular is a new medium term funding mechanism for funding priority areas and sectors that have highest impact on poverty reduction. Selection of these priority sectors and their funding is as agreed upon by the respective Government Cabinets, Civil Society, Parliaments, Representatives of ordinary citizens, the World Bank and IMF Boards.\\n\\nIn Tanzania there have been many approaches to fighting poverty, and the keys issues that are being developed include: \\n(i) address the problem of unemployment among youths and in the urban areas;\\n(ii) arrest environmental degradation; \\n(iii) stop the use of child labour; \\n(iv) increase financial support (including through extra debt cancellation and other forms of international support) for programs aimed at reducing poverty;\\n (v) Develop rural financial mechanisms that meet the needs of the "small" farmer;\\n (vi) Develop "micro", small and medium enterprises; \\n(vii) Inculcate a sense of self-reliance; \\n(viii) Intensify efforts aimed at developing an enabling environment for the    private sector; and\\n (ix) Facilitate the use of relevant research findings.\\n\\nThere is a National Poverty Monitoring Steering Committee (NPMSC) which includes representatives from all the relevant stakeholder groups. The Vice President's Office (VPO) plays a secretariat role to this committee. Since, poverty evaluation involves stopping now and again to review progress and decide whether or not the plan needs to be changed. Provisions are granted for participation at the implementation of the PRSP stakeholders in poverty monitoring and evaluation through participatory monitoring. Poverty monitoring and evaluation includes not only central and local government officials but also research institutions and university departments, development partners, civil society organizations and ordinary people. \\n\\n4.2 HIV/AIDS in Tanzania\\nIn Tanzania the first three AIDS cases were reported in 1983 in Kagera region. By 1986 all the regions in Tanzania Mainland had reported AIDS cases. According to the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) data for 2007, out of the 38.3 million Tanzania inhabitants, 1.4 million people are currently living with HIV. \\nThe Impact\\nThe impact of HIV pandemic in the country has been expressed in different ways including the number of people who died as a result of HIV reached 140,000 in the year 2006, reduction of life expectancy from 51 years in 1988 to 46 years in 2002, increased burden of providing treatment and care support to PLHAs to both the government health sector and at household levels. For example, a household with a patient living with HIV spends ten times more on health than a family without. About 1.1 million children in Tanzania are orphans and vulnerable as result of HIV pandemic. The World Bank further predicts that the mean age of the working population (labour force) will decline from 31.5 to 29 years between 1992 and 2010. \\nPolicy on HIV/AIDS \\nThe overall goal of the National Policy on HIV/AIDS is to provide for a framework for leadership and coordination of the National multispectral response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. There are specific objectives of the Policy and these are:\\na)  Prevention of transmission of HIV/AIDS \\ni)  To create and sustain an increased awareness of HIV/AIDS through targeted advocacy, information, education, and communication for behavior change at all levels by all sectors.\\n ii)  To prevent further transmission of HIV/AIDS through: \\n(a) making blood and blood products safe, and (b) promoting safer sex practices through faithfulness to partners, abstinence, non-penetrative sex, and condom use according to well informed individual decision. (c) early and effective treatment of STIs in health facilities, with special emphasis on high risk behavior groups, and early diagnosis of HIV infection through voluntary counselling and testing \\n\\nb) HIV Testing \\nTo promote early diagnosis of HIV infection through voluntary testing with pre-and-post test counselling. The main aim is to reassure and encourage the 85 - 90% of the population who are HIV negative to take definitive steps not to be infected. \\nc) Care for PLHAs \\ni) To provide counselling and social support services for  PLHAs and their families. \\nii) To combat stigma and strengthen living positively \\niii) To provide adequate treatment and medical care through an improved health care system which aims at enhancing quality of life. \\niv) To establish a system of referral and discharge that links hospital services to community services in a sustainable complementary relationship.  \\nv) To ensure that the cost of counseling and home care is reflected in the National and Local Councils Budgets for Health Care and Social Welfare Services. \\nvi) To involve and support communities in the provision of community based and home care services \\nd)Enabling Environment\\nThe Government of Tanzania has provided an enabling environment for expansion and a scaled up HIV and AIDS multi-sectoral approach involving government ministries, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), faith-based organizations (FBOs), bilateral and multilateral agencies, private sector and networks/associations of people living with HIV. TACAIDS provides overall coordination and monitoring of the multi-sectoral national HIV and AIDS response. Currently, the Tanzania Government is implementing the National HIV and AIDS Action Framework 2005-2009, which is focusing on prevention, behaviour change, care, support, treatment, mitigation; socio-economic and psychosocial support, mainstreaming, partnerships and capacity building, research and development, monitoring and evaluation, resource mobilization, tracking and utilization, national policy, coordination and programme planning.\\nHIV/AIDS and Poverty \\nIt has been well established that poverty significantly influences the spread and impact of HIV/AIDS. In many ways it creates vulnerability to HIV infection, causes rapid progression of the infection in the individual due to malnutrition and limits access to social and health care services. Poverty causes impoverishment as it leads to death of the economically active segments of the society and bread winners leading to reduction in income or production. \\n4.3 Street Children\\nThe population of Tanzania is estimated to be 40.2 million people. Children under 15 are about 17 million and constitute about 44% of the population, and are equally divided between males and females. The population growth rate is 2.9 per cent (2008 Estimates).\\nThere has been an increase in street children numbers in urban centers since the early 1990s due to the impact of poverty on households and the effect of HIV/AIDS. The urban population is estimated at about 26%. \\nWidespread poverty impacting on rural-urban migration; widespread unemployment; family breakdown; lack of non-formal education opportunities; difficulties of providing street children with opportunities to support themselves in formal employment; traditional nonintervention in family violence; inadequate juvenile justice system and lack of mechanisms to document and report police abuses; few organizations specializing full-time in street children.\\nOf late several NGOs have been preoccupied with the problems of street children, some providing home based care and some providing temporary relief for the children. There is a draft national policy on orphans and  street children which favours home based care, by foster parents or close relatives, where the children have no parents.\\nCentre-based residential approaches are not always suited to the needs of street children who find it hard to comply with rules. There is therefore  need for more street-based and flexible programmes. \\nDonor trends are currently overemphasizing ‘strengthening civil society’ at the expense of basic service provision. There is need for systematic, appropriate and holistic approach to street children by CSOs, government and donors; donors also reluctant to fund staff salaries and core costs which undermines stability of projects.\\nThe main cause of street children is poverty. Interventions that do not address the issue of poverty are likely to lack long term impact.\\n5. INTERVENTION BY TCEO\\nThe mission of TCEO to empower the marginalized people to fend for themselves, mainly by providing them with life skills. This will be done by conducting educational campaigns, providing street children with opportunities for better life through improved access  education and teaching them life skills, providing them with basic requirements such as school uniforms, shoes, exercise books, pens and pencils, and food. For the programmed to be sustainable it needs to have secure sources of finance. \\nInitially financial resources will be sought from sympathetic persons and institutions. However this source is not expected to be self sustaining because it is difficult to find donors who can support a cause for a long period of time. Very often it has been proved to be very frustrating when as source of finance dries up when implementation of a particular activity in a programme has not yet come to its conclusion. \\nTCEO will therefore implement income generating activities that will be self sustaining, and will use surplus generated by those activities to finance programmes for the disadvantages.                       These projects will be undertaken by a center to be known as TN Center (Tuko Nawe Center). Tuko Nawe signifies that the marginalized have our support. \\nTCEO is in the process of acquiring 20 ha of land in the outskirts of Dodoma city. The plot is easily accessible by a tarmac road and is serviced by electricity from the national grid. Water is available from the city mains......JouneMwambene Dodoma Tanzania
'''The Coping Project''' is child-centered research that aims to investigate the characteristics of children with imprisoned parents, their resilience, and their vulnerability to mental health problems. Over the period of the next three years, the study will cover four countries (UK, Germany, Sweden and Romania). The findings, however, are expected to have European-wide and international application. \\n\\nThe COPING research strategy’s innovative approach places the clearest emphasis on knowledge obtained directly from children and young people. Total survey sample will be 800 interviews, 200 children with an imprisoned parent in each of the four countries. \\n\\nThe Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale will be used to ascertain coping strategies and mental health problems for these young people; results subsequently will be compared with normative population samples. Smaller groups of children and parents will be involved in qualitative interviews to explore the impact of parental imprisonment and support services available in greater detail. Further available intervention services to support these families will be comprehensively mapped.

This disorder is classified in the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) as an anxiety disorder that is developed after experiencing an interpersonal traumatic event that engages threat of injury or death.  These circumstances are usually involved with events such as physical or sexual assault, active engagement in war, situations of terrorism, and natural disasters.  \\nEveryday life brings about a variety of experiences that trigger certain human emotions.  These emotions can range from a feeling of happiness, sadness, anger, and fear.  A specific human emotion felt by all people in a variety of situations is anxiety.  It is not uncommon for situations including a student right before a test, a person struggling with a problem at work, or someone making an import decision to feel anxious, nervous, or overwhelmed.\\n	It is when anxiety begins to take over one’s life and control of their mental well-being and dramatically affect their over all mood when it becomes a psychological problem.  Anxiety disorders are one of the most commonly diagnosed psychological disorders (Ruscio, Chiu, Roy-Byrne, Stang, Stein, Wittchen & Kessler, 2006).  There are many kinds of anxiety disorders that consist of panic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, a variety of phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder.  Posttraumatic stress disorder is one of the most discussed of these disorders due to its high frequency of occurrence and unique symptoms.\\n“Such events often include either experiencing or witnessing a severe accident or physical injury, receiving a life-threatening medical diagnosis, being the victim of kidnapping or torture, exposure to war combat or to a natural disaster, exposure to other disaster (for example, plane crash) or terrorist attack, being the victim of rape, mugging, robbery, or assault, enduring physical, sexual, emotional, or other forms of abuse, as well as involvement in civil conflict.” (Yehuda, 2002)\\n\\nRisk Factor\\n 	Certain factors increase the likelihood of developing posttraumatic stress disorder after the incident.  The first of these is the severity and duration of the event (Lilly & Valdez, 2012).  For example, a veteran who spent months over seas experiencing the horrific life threatening events of war will have a greater chance of developing PTSD than someone who was in a single car accident.  Another factor that increases the chance of developing PTSD is having a weak social support (Jakupcak, Vannoy, Imel, 2010).  This system would be primarily composed of family members and friends.  People of poverty stricken areas who have been diagnosed with the disorder have been linked to this cause from lack of a strong support system (Chen, Keith, 2007).\\n\\nSymptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\\n	Posttraumatic stress disorder has a range of effects.  These effects include physical, psychological, and social factors that negatively affect the patient’s daily life and activities.  One of the most common symptoms seen in patients suffering from PTSD is the act of “reliving” the traumatic event (Yehuda, 2002).  For example, a war veteran who personally experienced intense and violent warfare will have repeated flashback episodes of being back in battle.  This veteran will suffer from all the intense and negative emotions that come with combat while sitting safely in their own home.  Patients will also suffer from upsetting nightmares and have strong, damaging reactions to common situations that remind them of their traumatic event.\\n	Another common symptom of people suffering from PTSD is the act of avoidance.  Under this symptom, patients feel detached from social situations and have a feeling as though not to care about anything.  This is commonly referred to as emotional “numbing”.  Due to patients having negative reactions to situations that remind them of the traumatic event, they will avoid people, places, and thoughts that remind them of such event (Yehuda, 2002).\\n\\nImpairments in Brain Functioning	\\nPosttraumatic stress disorder has an affect of certain portions and structures of the brain.  Three of the most impacted of these structures are the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the hippocampus.  The prefrontal cortex is the portion of the brain that is associated with the act of planning and formulating strategies (Yehuda, 2002).  Patients suffering from PTSD have a reduced responsiveness within this structure.  The next structure that is impacted is the amygdala, which is a temporal lobe involved in the assessment of stimuli related to threatening situations and plays a vital role in the development of fear conditioning.  The amygdala and prefrontal cortex work together in a negative feedback relationship.  When a patient is suffering from PTSD this feedback situation is negatively impacted and unbalanced.  This causes the amygdala to be hyper-responsive, which leads to ambiguous stimuli to more frequently be seen as threatening (Yehuda, 2002).  When more stimuli are observed as threatening there is a high increase in the patients stress levels, which only sparks more ambiguous stimuli to be viewed as threatening.  It becomes a violent spiral in which the patient always loses.  \\nThe last brain structure that is affected by PTSD is the hippocampus.  This structure is also part of the medial temporal lobe and is involved in memory and the processes surrounding it.  Increased levels of arousal as a result of stressors and high level of stress hormones lower hippocampal functioning.  This leads to lower levels of long-term potentiation, which decreases the amount of strengthening of nerve cells and their synapses.  All of this leads to memory impairment and decreased cognitive functioning (Yehuda, 2002).\\n\\nAttention and Inhibition Impairment Associated with PTSD\\n	Emotional impairment due to improper functioning of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala and memory impairment from improper hippocampus functioning aren’t the only two cognitive features affected by the disorder.  Attention and inhibition are also affected by posttraumatic stress disorder.  Soldiers recently returning from overseas that are diagnosed with PTSD do not immediately show signs of this decrease in attention.  It is not until one year or more that these symptoms start to appear.  This is due to the build up of negative experiences associated with PTSD over a prolonged period of time; these experiences include frequent flashbacks and nightmares of the horrific event.  As time goes by these stressors on the neurological system cause neurobiological alterations, affecting the noradrenergetic and neuroendocrine systems.  As a result, there is a damaging effect on attention and learning (Yehuda, 2002).\\n	The negative affects that PTSD has on cognitive functions can have a serious impact on an individual’s daily life and normal functioning.  These impacts initially depend on age range.   Soldiers, who have recently returned from the Iraq or Afghanistan war, will feel affects such as brief gaps in short term memory and mild disabilities in attention tasks.  Veterans from wars included Vietnam or people who have suffered from PTSD symptoms for an extended period of time will feel more extreme effects.  These include extreme memory loss from specific anxiety ridden situations, significant emotional changes towards loved ones and close friends, and attention difficulties in various tasks.\\n	Posttraumatic stress disorder will continue to be one of the most discussed and feared of the range of anxiety disorders.  The effects of posttraumatic stress disorder can have an assortment of negative impacts on cognitive functions of the patients.  These effects vary from emotion, memory, and attention difficulties as a result of the malfunctioning of portions and structures in the brain, as well as the general suffering from the disorder.  Anxiety disorders will not simply disappear one day, their effects will continues to expand and cause negative impacts on peoples lives all over the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRefrences:\\n\\nChen, A.

== Existing regulations ==\\nDetroit automakers say that CAFE did not work to reduce fuel consumption. They point out that the price of oil was spiking in the late 1970s and early 1980s, at the same time that CAFE was being implemented, and that therefore fuel economy would have\\nincreased anyway. Let’s review the facts.\\n\\n* After Congress set fuel economy standards for vehicles in 1975, our dependence on oil imports decreased very quickly from 46 percent in 1977 to 27 percent in 1985.\\n\\n* After 1981, however, the price of oil fell rapidly.\\n\\n* CAFE standards continued to be increased after 1981 and the actual fuel economy for cars and trucks separately continued to rise.\\n\\n* Combined fuel economy for cars and trucks has been falling since 1986, not because “CAFE failed” but because of a loophole in the law that allowed trucks to meet a lower fuel economy standard. Automakers used that loophole, designed to protect farmers and small business, to build family vehicles on truck chassis – familiarly known as [[SUV]]s and [[Minivan]]s.\\n\\n* CAFE worked to increase average fuel economy for cars and trucks separately, but the steady growth in trucks from less than 20% of the market before CAFE to over 50% today, eventually offset CAFE. As a result, total fuel economy has been falling\\nsince 1986.\\n\\n* Without CAFE standards, we would be using an additional 80 billion gallons of gasoline on top of the 140 billion gallons we will use this year. That would represent  an increase in oil demand by 5.2 million barrels of oil per day, or a 25 percent\\nincrease in our oil addiction. At today’s average price for regular gasoline, about $2.50 per gallon, that represents $200 billion dollars saved.\\n\\n* Even today, these standards continue to save nearly 3 million barrels of oil per day, according to the National Academies of Sciences. Since 1985, however, fuel economy has been stagnant and our imports have grown.\\n\\n* According to data in the 2002 report by the National Academies of Sciences on CAFE, the technology exists to reach 37 mpg in a fleet of the same make-up as the NAS analyzed, even ignoring hybrids and cleaner diesels.\\n\\n* Paul Portney, chair of the NAS committee, recently noted that, “It might be possible to meet more stringent fuel economy standards at lower costs than the committee foresaw.”\\n\\n* The United States is falling behind other nations pushing for better fuel economy as concerns mount over global warming. Even China, oft touted as the reason why the U.S. shouldn’t act, has tougher fuel economy standards.\\n\\n* Because the automakers did not meet voluntary agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the European Commission in Brussels is moving mandate automakers to limit carbon-dioxide emission to an average of 130 grams per kilometer for all new cars by 2012. \\n\\n===CAFE Going Forward===\\n\\nCAFE is usually seen as mandating the average fuel economy that each automaker must attain for its vehicles. However, fines for not meeting the required average fuel economy support enforcement of CAFE. The current fine that an automaker not meeting the required average fuel economy pays is $55 for each mile per gallon the automaker’s average fuel economy falls short of the requirement, multiplied by total unit sales. \\n\\nThe CAFE [[fine]] is too small to have induced compliance by itself. The Gas Guzzler Tax applies only to cars and amounts to an average of $585 per mile per gallon below 21.5 [[mpg]]. Recent estimates both by UMTRIvi and by Espey and Nairvii put the value that consumers put on fuel economy at about $600 per mile per gallon. Compliance also depends on interpreting the CAFE fines as penalties for illegal behavior, which would have consequences far more serious for publicly traded corporations than the magnitude of the fines.\\n\\nThe Detroit automakers, as U.S. corporations, have been unwilling to risk being penalized under CAFE and have always met the CAFE requirements, Most of the Japanbased automakers have always exceeded the CAFE requirements, so the fines have not\\nbeen an issue. The European automakers are the only ones who have consistently paid CAFE fines. The European automakers have a relatively small share in the U.S. and total fines collected annually have always been less than $100 million.\\n\\nIn order to induce automakers to significantly increase fuel economy, the fees for falling below the goal would need to be much higher than the current $55 per mpg in CAFE—on the order of $600 per mpg or more—or the illegal nature of noncompliance would need to be maintained or strengthened.
Australia is as big as united states mainland but has a smaller population than texas. The vast, dry interior, kown as the outback, consist mainly deserts and grasslands. It contains mineral reserves and is used for grazigng huge numbers of sheep and cattle, but few people live there. Most australians live in or near cities along the east, southeast and southwest coast, where the climate is temperate and the land fertile. The far northeast is tropical, with areas of dense rain forest. The southeast is cooler, and mountain snowfall are common. Most of australia's native people, the aborigines, live in town and cities, but some still follow old traditions in the outback. Aborigines originally came to australia more than 40,000 years ago, having crossed from the island of new guinea, an australian territory until 1975, is made up of several is land chains and half the island of new guinea. The main island is covered in jungle and sorruned by swampy swamps. Most people live in small villages, where they grow food in gardens and raise animals.
Zero Carbon Task Force\\n\\nIn launching The Children's Plan in 2007, Secretary of State Ed Balls stated that he wanted all schools to be zero carbon by 2016 CITATION but little is know publicly of the detail of this aspiration. In 2008, at the instigation of the Secretary of State, the Department for Children, Schools and Families established a Zero Carbon Task Force to develop a route towards zero carbon schools. CITATION Robin Nicholson was asked to chair the group which comprises a wide range of experts representing industry, education, environmental groups, academics and public sector bodies. Shortly after its formation, Dame Ellen MacArthur was invited to champion the work of the Task Force, not simply because of her public profile but because she is committed to tackling environmental issues. CITATION\\n\\nEarly work of the Task Force highlighted the great difficulties that will be faced in achieving a zero carbon goal whilst electricity use continues to increase as more and more information communication technology (ICT) equipment is deployed in schools. The use of ICT in schools is seen as a key contributor to raising educational standards in England. CITATION In September of 2008 the DCSF invited bids for exemplar pilot projects to test and demonstrate how new technologies might be used to reduce the carbon footprint of schools.  That such an initiative is necessary is indicated by statistics from some Local Authorities (LAs) that show that almost half the carbon emissions emanate from schools. CITATION\\n\\nThe impact of the Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) may well become a means of engaging stakeholders in plotting a route towards zero carbon schools. At present schools have no obligation to reduce their emissions under CRC but LAs will be responsible for purchasing schools' carbon emission allowances.
Energy efficiency and boiler operation.\\nAll combustion requires the correct measure of oxygen; too much or too little can cause undesirable effects. However, the error is almost always intentionally on the high-side (too much oxygen) because the main effect on the high side is low efficiency. Too little air results in carbon monoxide formation, sooting and even explosion if accumulated soot and other non-combusted suddenly get enough oxygen to rapidly burn.\\n\\nWhen boiler burners are manually tuned on a periodic basis, they are typically adjusted to about 3% excess oxygen which is about 15% excess air. This is because there are many ambient and atmospheric conditions that can affect oxygen/air supply. For example, colder air is denser and contains more oxygen than warm air; wind speed affects every chimney/flue/stack differently; and barometric pressure further affects draft. See Air Temp and Pressure. Therefore, an excess oxygen/air setting at the time of tuning assumes there will still be enough oxygen available for complete combustion when conditions worsen.\\n\\nFrom an efficiency standpoint, the excess O2 means there is more air in the combustion stream than there needs to be. That air also contains moisture, and it all is heated and then lost up the stack. The amount of excess O2 is about directly proportional to the efficiency lost; that is, 3% excess O2 means 3% efficiency drop.\\n\\nAlthough it may be possible to monitor and adjust the burner on a daily basis, it is not practical. Automatic O2 systems continuously monitor the flue gases and adjust the burner air supply. They are generically called 'O2 Trim Systems'.There are laws that soon may be mandated to make these systems mandatory on boilers over 200 horsepower.
[[File:Plants (6).jpg|thumb|Flowering Plant|250px|right]]\\n'''Secondary metabolism''' produces a large number of specialized compounds (estimated 200,000) that do not aid in the growth and development of plants but are required for the plant to survive in its environment.  [[Secondary metabolism]] is connected to primary metabolism by using building blocks and biosynthetic enzymes derived from primary metabolism. Primary metabolism governs all basic physiological processes that allow a plant to grow and set seeds, by translating the genetic code into proteins, carbohydrates, and amino acids.  Specialized compounds from secondary metabolism are essential for communicating with other organisms in mutualistic (e.g. attraction of beneficial organisms such as pollinators) or antagonistic interactions (e.g. deterrent against herbivores and pathogens). They further assist in coping with abiotic stress such as increased UV-radiation.  The broad functional spectrum of specialized metabolism is still not fully understood. In any case, a good balance between products of primary and secondary metabolism is best for a plant’s optimal growth and development as well as for its effective coping with often changing environmental conditions. Well known specialized compounds include alkaloids, polyphenols including flavonoids, and terpenoids. Humans use many of these compounds for culinary, medicinal and nutraceutical purposes.\\n\\n==History==\\n\\nResearch into secondary plant metabolism primarily took off in the later half of the 19th century, however, there was still much confusion over what the exact function and usefulness of these compounds were. All that was known was that secondary plant [[metabolites]] were "by-products" of the primary metabolism and were not crucial to the plant's survival. Early research only succeeded as far as categorizing the secondary plant metabolites but did not give real insight into the actual function of the secondary plant metabolites. The study of plant metabolites is thought to have started in the early 1800s when Friedrich Willhelm Serturner isolated morphine from opium poppy, and after that new discoveries were made rapidly. In the early half of the 1900s, the main research around secondary plant metabolism was dedicated to the formation of [[secondary metabolites]] in plants, and this research was compounded by the use of tracer techniques which made deducing [[metabolic pathways]] much easier. However, there was still not much research being conducted into the functions of secondary plant metabolites until around the 1980s. Before then, secondary plant metabolites were thought of as simply waste products. In the 1970s, however, new research showed that secondary plant metabolites play an indispensable role in the survival of the plant in its environment. One of the most ground breaking ideas of this time argued that plant secondary metabolites evolved in relation to environmental conditions, and this indicated the high gene plasticity of secondary metabolites,  but this theory was ignored for about half a century before gaining acceptance. Recently, the research around secondary plant metabolites is focused around the gene level and the genetic diversity of plant metabolites. Biologists are now trying to trace back genes to their origin and re-construct evolutionary pathways.<ref>Hartmann, Thomas.

Web. 31 Mar 2011.</ref>\\n\\n==Primary vs. secondary plant metabolism==\\n\\nPrimary metabolism in a plant comprises all metabolic pathways that are essential to the plant's survival. Primary metabolites are compounds that are directly involved in the growth and development of a plant whereas secondary metabolites are compounds produced in other metabolic pathways that, although important, are not essential to the functioning of the plant. However, secondary plant metabolites are useful in the long term, often for [[plant defence against herbivory|defense purposes]], and give plants characteristics such as color. Secondary plant metabolites are also used in signalling and regulation of primary metabolic pathways. Plant hormones, which are secondary metabolites, are often used to regulate the metabolic activity within cells and oversee the overall development of the plant. As mentioned above in the History tab, secondary plant metabolites help the plant maintain an intricate balance with the environment, often adapting to match the environmental needs. Plant metabolites that color the plant are a good example of this, as the coloring of a plant can attract pollinators and also defend against attack by animals.\\n\\n==Types of secondary metabolites in plants==\\n\\nThere is no fixed, commonly agreed upon system for classifying secondary metabolites. Based on their biosynthetic origins, plant secondary metabolites can be divided into three major groups:<ref>{{cite book|title=Plant Secondary Metabolites: Occurrence, Structure and Role in the Human Diet|doi=10.1002/9780470988558|chapter=Chapter 1.

[[Alkaloid]]s contain nitrogens, frequently in a ring structure, and are derived from [[amino acids]].  Tropane is an organic compound containing nitrogen and it is from tropane that atropine is derived.  Atropine is synthesized by a reaction between [[tropine]] and tropate, catalyzed by atropinase.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?3.1.1.10+R03563|title = Kegg Enzyme: 3.1.1.10}}</ref>  Both of the substrates involved in this reaction are derived from amino acids, tropine from pyridine (through several steps) and tropate directly from [[phenylalanine]].  Within [[Atropa belladonna]] atropine synthesis has been found to take place primarily in the root of the plant.<ref>Fred R. West, Jr. and Edward S. Mika. "Synthesis of Atropine by Isolated Roots and Root-Callus Cultures of Belladonna." Botanical Gazette: Vol. 119, No. 1 (Sep., 1957), pp. 50–54 https://www.jstor.org/stable/2473263</ref> The concentration of synthetic sites within the plant is indicative of the nature of secondary metabolites.  Typically, secondary metabolites are not necessary for normal functioning of cells within the organism meaning the synthetic sites are not required throughout the organism.  As atropine is not a [[primary metabolite]], it does not interact specifically with any part of the organism, allowing it to travel throughout the plant.\\n\\n=== Flavonoids ===\\n[[Flavonoids]] are one class of secondary plant metabolites that are also known as Vitamin P or [[citrin]]. These metabolites are mostly used in plants to produce yellow and other pigments which play a big role in coloring the plants. In addition, Flavonoids are readily ingested by humans and they seem to display important anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and anti-cancer activities. Flavonoids are also found to be powerful anti-oxidants and researchers are looking into their ability to prevent cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Flavonoids help prevent cancer by inducing certain mechanisms that may help to kill cancer cells, and researches believe that when the body processes extra flavonoid compounds, it triggers specific enzymes that fight carcinogens. Good dietary sources of Flavonoids are all citrus fruits, which contain the specific flavanoids hesperidins, [[quercitrin]], and [[rutin]], berries, tea, dark chocolate and red wine and many of the health benefits attributed to these foods come from the Flavonoids they contain. Flavonoids are synthesized by the [[phenylpropanoid]] metabolic pathway where the amino acid [[phenylalanine]] is used to produce 4-coumaryol-CoA, and this is then combined with malonyl-CoA to produce [[Chalconoid|chalcones]] which are backbones of Flavonoids<ref>Crozier, Alan, and Hiroshi Ashihara. Plant Secondary Metabolites: Occurrence, Structure and Role in the Human Diet. Ames, IA: Blackwell Publishing Professional, 2006. Print.</ref> [[Chalconoid|Chalcones]] are aromatic ketones with two phenyl rings that are important in many biological compounds. The closure of chalcones causes the formation of the flavonoid structure. Flavonoids are also closely related to flavones which are actually a sub class of flavonoids, and are the yellow pigments in plants. In addition to flavones, 11 other subclasses of Flavonoids including, isoflavones, flavans, flavanones, flavanols, flavanolols, anthocyanidins, catechins (including proanthocyanidins), leukoanthocyanidins, dihydrochalcones, and aurones.\\n\\n=== Cyanogenic glycoside ===\\n{{main|Cyanogenic glycoside}}\\nMany plants have adapted to iodine-deficient terrestrial environment by removing iodine from their metabolism, in fact iodine is essential only for animal cells.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=727–9 |doi=10.1089/10507250050137851 |title=Environmental Iodine Deficiency: A Challenge to the Evolution of Terrestrial Life? |year=2000 |last1=Venturi |first1=S. |last2=Donati |first2=F.M. |last3=Venturi |first3=A. |last4=Venturi |first4=M. |journal=Thyroid |volume=10 |issue=8 |pmid=11014322}}</ref>\\nAn important antiparasitic action is caused by the block of the transport of iodide of animal cells inhibiting [[sodium-iodide symporter]] (NIS). Many plant pesticides are cyanogenic glycoside which liberate [[cyanide]], which, blocking [[cytochrome c oxidase]] and NIS, is poisonous only for a large part of parasites and herbivores and not for the plant cells in which it seems useful in [[seed dormancy]] phase.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine|journal=Current Chemical Biology|volume=5 |pages=155–162|year=2011|issn=1872-3136|doi=10.2174/187231311796765012|issue=3}}</ref> To get a better understanding of how secondary metabolites play a big role in plant defense mechanisms we can focus on the recognizable defense-related secondary metabolites, cyanogenic glycosides. The compounds of these secondary metabolites (As seen in Figure 1) are found in over 2000 plant species. Its structure allows the release of [[cyanide]], a poison produced by certain bacteria, fungi, and algae that is found in numerous plants. Animals and humans possess the ability to detoxify cyanide from their systems naturally. Therefore, cyanogenic glycosides can be used for positive benefits in animal systems always. For example, the larvae of the southern armyworm consumes plants that contain this certain metabolite and have shown a better growth rate with this metabolite in their diet, as opposed to other secondary metabolite-containing plants. Although this example shows cyanogenic glycosides being beneficial to the larvae many still argue that this metabolite can do harm. To help in determining whether cyanogenic glycosides are harmful or helpful researchers look closer at its biosynthetic pathway (Figure 2). Past research suggests that cyanogenic glucosides stored in the seed of the plant are metabolized during germination to release nitrogen for seedling to grow. With this, it can be inferred that cyanogenic glycosides play various roles in plant metabolism. Though subject to change with future research, there is no evidence showing that cyanogenic glycosides are responsible for infections in plants.\\n\\n=== Phytic acid ===\\n[[Phytic acid]] is the main method of phosphorus storage in plant seeds, but is not readily absorbed by many animals (only absorbed by [[ruminant]] animals).  Not only is phytic acid a phosphorus storage unit, but it also is a source of energy and [[cations]], a natural [[antioxidant]] for plants, and can be a source of [[myoinositol]] which is one of the preliminary pieces for cell walls.\\n\\nPhytic acid is also known to bond with many different minerals, and by doing so prevents those minerals from being absorbed; making phytic acid an anti-nutrient.<ref>http://naturalbias.com/a-hidden-danger-with-nuts-grains-and-seeds/</ref> There is a lot of concern with phytic acids in nuts and seeds because of its anti-nutrient characteristics.  In preparing foods with high phytic acid concentrations, it is recommended they be soaked in after being ground to increase the surface area.<ref>http://www.phyticacid.org/nuts/phytic-acid-in-nuts/</ref>  Soaking allows the seed to undergo [[germination]] which increases the availability of vitamins and nutrient, while reducing phytic acid and [[protease inhibitors]], ultimately increasing the nutritional value.  Cooking can also reduce the amount of phytic acid in food but soaking is much more effective.\\n\\nPhytic acid is an [[antioxidant]] found in plant cells that most likely serves the purpose of preservation.  This preservation is removed when soaked, reducing the phytic acid and allowing the germination and growth of the seed.  When added to foods it can help prevent discoloration by inhibiting lipid peroxidation.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 2182395 | volume=8 | issue=1 | title=Antioxidant functions of phytic acid | year=1990 | pages=61–9 | last1 = Graf | first1 = E | last2 = Eaton | first2 = JW | journal = Free Radical Biology & Medicine | doi=10.1016/0891-5849(90)90146-A }}</ref>\\nThere is also some belief that the chelating of phytic acid may have potential use in the treatment of cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11198165 | volume=56 | issue=3 | title=The role of phytic acid in legumes: antinutrient or beneficial function? |date=September 2000 | pages=283–94 | last1 = Urbano | first1 = G | last2 = López-Jurado | first2 = M | last3 = Aranda | first3 = P | last4 = Vidal-Valverde | first4 = C | last5 = Tenorio | first5 = E | last6 = Porres | first6 = J | journal = Journal of Physiology and Biochemistry | doi=10.1007/bf03179796| s2cid=30361388 }}</ref>\\n\\n=== Gossypol ===\\n[[Gossypol]] has a yellow pigment and is found in cotton plants.  It occurs mainly in the root and/or seeds of different species of cotton plants.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schultz|first=Jack|title=Secondary Metabolites in Plants|url=http://www.biologyreference.com/Re-Se/Secondary-Metabolites-in-Plants.html|publisher=Biology Reference|access-date=2011-03-27}}</ref> Gossypol can have various chemical structures.  It can exist in three forms: gossypol, gossypol acetic acid, and gossypol formic acid. All of these forms have very similar biological properties.  Gossypol is a type of aldehyde, meaning that it has a formyl group.  The formation of gossypol occurs through an isoprenoid pathway.  Isoprenoid pathways are common among secondary metabolites.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=P. F. Heinstein|author2=D. L. Herman|author3=S. B. Tove|author4=F. H.

An example of gossypol's enzyme inhibition is its ability to inhibit nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked enzymes of Trypanosoma cruzi.

Extensive studies have shown that gossypol has other functions.  Many of the more popular studies on gossypol discuss how it can act as a male [[contraceptive]].  Gossypol has also been linked to causing hypokalemic paralysis.  [[Hypokalemic]] paralysis is a disease characterized by muscle weakness or paralysis with a matching fall in potassium levels in the blood. Hypokalemic paralysis associated with gossypol in-take usually occurs in March, when vegetables are in short supply, and in September, when people are sweating a lot.  This side effect of gossypol in-take is very rare however.  Gossypol induced hypokalemic paralysis is easily treatable with potassium repletion.\\n<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Qian, Shao-Zhen and|first1=Wang, Zhen-Gang|journal=Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology |year=1984|volume=24|pages=329–360|doi=10.1146/annurev.pa.24.040184.001553|pmid=6375548|last2=Wang|first2=Z|title=Gossypol: A Potential Antifertility Agent for Males}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Phytoestrogens ===\\nPlants synthesize certain compounds called secondary metabolites which are not naturally produced by humans but can play vital roles in protection or destruction of human health.

They are also found in some organisms such as algae, fungi, some bacteria, and certain species of aphids. There are over 600 known carotenoids. They are split into two classes, [[xanthophylls]] and [[carotene]]s. Xanthophylls are carotenoids with molecules containing oxygen, such as [[lutein]] and [[zeaxanthin]]. Carotenes are carotenoids with molecules that are unoxygenated, such as [[alpha-carotene|α-carotene]], [[Beta-Carotene|β-carotene]] and [[lycopene]].<ref>[[Carotenoid]]</ref> In plants, carotenoids can occur in roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Carotenoids have two important functions in plants. First, they can contribute to photosynthesis. They do this by transferring some of the light energy they absorb to [[chlorophylls]], which then uses this energy for photosynthesis. Second, they can protect plants which are over-exposed to sunlight. They do this by harmlessly dissipating excess light energy which they absorb as heat. In the absence of carotenoids, this excess light energy could destroy proteins, membranes, and other molecules. Some plant physiologists believe that carotenoids may have an additional function as regulators of certain developmental responses in plants.{{cn|date=August 2022}} [[Tetraterpene]]s are synthesized from DOXP precursors in plants and some bacteria. Carotenoids involved in photosynthesis are formed in chloroplasts; Others are formed in plastids. Carotenoids formed in fungi are presumably formed from mevalonic acid precursors. Carotenoids are formed by a head-to-head condensation of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate or diphosphate (GGPP) and there is no NADPH requirement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.life.illinois.edu/ib/425/lecture26.html |title=Tetraterpenes and Carotenoids |website=www.life.illinois.edu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320010949/http://www.life.illinois.edu/ib/425/lecture26.html |archive-date=2012-03-20}}</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist|2}}\\n\\n[[Category:Plant physiology]]

== Writing Therapy, by Tim Atkinson ==\\nThis novel, published in 2008, explores the therapeutic use of writing in the treatment of mental illness. The protagonist, who starts the book as Frances Nolan but whose name changes midway through the book to Sophie Western, suffers from depression. Truanting from school, she spends her days in the local library reading 'more books than is good for her' and ultimately believing she is a character. Events are thus dictated for her by an external author. Out-of-control, she becomes seriously mentally ill, is hospitalised and ultimately cured thanks to the intervention of a young trainee, who manages to persuade the girl that she is the author of her destiny. \\n\\nThe book is set in the 1980's at a time when routine treatment of the mentally ill took place in large, often Victorian, psychiatric hospitals or asylums. The anti-psychiatry movement of progressive mental-health professionals such as R.D.Laing was often set in direct opposition within such institutions to traditional chemical and surgical procedures such as ECT. This debate - which is by no means settled to this day - is personalised in the novel as a struggle between two individuals: Ted, the Charge-Nurse in the Adolescent Unit, and a student psychiatric nurse called Will.
'''Power optimization''' is the use of electronic design automation tools to optimize (reduce) the power consumption of a digital design, such as that of an integrated circuit, while preserving the functionality.\\n\\n==Introduction and history==\\n\\nThe increasing speed and complexity of today’s designs implies a significant increase in the power consumption of [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) [[integrated circuit|chip]]s. To meet this challenge, researchers have developed many different design techniques to reduce power. The complexity of today’s ICs, with over 100 million\\ntransistors, clocked at over 1&nbsp;GHz, means manual power optimization would be hopelessly slow and all too likely to contain errors.  Computer-aided design (CAD) tools and methodologies are mandatory.\\n\\nOne of the key features that led to the success of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, or [[CMOS]],  technology was its intrinsic low-power consumption. This meant that circuit designers and electronic design automation (EDA) tools could afford to concentrate on maximizing circuit performance and minimizing circuit area. Another interesting feature of CMOS technology is its nice scaling properties, which has permitted a steady decrease in the feature size (see [[Moore's law]]), allowing for more and more complex systems on a single chip, working at higher clock frequencies.\\nPower consumption concerns came into play with the appearance of the first portable electronic systems in the late 1980s. In this market, battery lifetime is a decisive factor for the commercial success of the product. Another fact that became apparent at about the same time was that the increasing integration of more active elements per die area would lead to prohibitively large-energy consumption of an integrated circuit. A high absolute level of power is not only undesirable for economic and environmental\\nreasons, but it also creates the problem of heat dissipation. In order to keep the device working at acceptable temperature levels, excessive heat may require expensive heat removal systems.\\n\\nThese factors have contributed to the rise of power as a major design parameter on par with performance and die size. In fact, power consumption is regarded as the limiting factor in the continuing scaling of CMOS technology.  To respond to this challenge, in the last decade or so, intensive research has been put into developing computed-aided design (CAD) tools that address the problem of power optimization. Initial efforts were directed to circuit and logic-level tools because at this level CAD tools were more mature and there was a better handle on the issues. Today, most of the research for CAD tools targets system or architectural level optimization, which potentially have a higher overall impact, given the breadth of their application.\\n\\nTogether with optimization tools, efficient techniques for power estimation are required, both as an absolute indicator that the circuit’s consumption meets some target value and as a relative indicator of the power merits of different alternatives during design space exploration.\\n\\n==Power analysis of CMOS circuits==\\nThe power consumption of digital CMOS circuits is generally considered in terms of three components:\\n*The ''dynamic power'' component, related to the charging and discharging of the load capacitance at the gate output.\\n*The ''short-circuit power'' component.  During the transition of the output line (of a CMOS gate) from one voltage level to the other, there is a period of time when both the PMOS and the NMOS transistors are on, thus creating a path from V<sub>DD</sub> to ground.\\n*The ''static power'' component, due to leakage, that is present even when the circuit is not switching. This, in turn, is composed of two components - ''gate to source leakage'', which is leakage directly through the gate insulator, mostly by tunnelling, and ''source-drain leakage'' attributed to both tunnelling and sub-threshold conduction. The contribution of the static power component to the total power number is growing very rapidly in the current era of ''Deep Sub-Micrometre (DSM) Design''.\\n\\nPower can be estimated at a number of levels of detail.  The higher levels of abstraction are faster and handle larger circuits, but are less accurate.  The main levels include:\\n*Circuit Level Power Estimation, using a circuit simulator such as SPICE\\n*Static Power Estimation does not use the input vectors, but may use the input statistics.  Analogous to [[static timing analysis]].\\n*Logic-Level Power Estimation, often linked to [[logic simulation]].\\n*Analysis at the Register-Transfer Level.  Fast and high capacity, but not as accurate.\\n\\n==Circuit-level power optimization==\\n[[Image:Shapeshifter Heat.PNG|right|thumb|300px|A rendering of a small [[standard cell]] taken from a larger design showing heating effects directly related to power consumption.]]\\n\\nMany different techniques are used to reduce power consumption at the circuit level.  Some of the main ones are:\\n*Transistor sizing: adjusting the size of each gate or transistor for minimum power.\\n*Voltage scaling: lower supply voltages use less power, but go slower.\\n*Voltage islands:  Different blocks can be run at different voltages, saving power. This design practice may require the use of level-shifters when two blocks with different supply voltages communicate with each other.\\n*Variable V<sub>DD</sub>: The voltage for a single block can be varied during operation - high voltage (and high power) when the block needs to go fast, low voltage when slow operation is acceptable.\\n*Multiple [[threshold voltage]]s: Modern processes can build transistors with different thresholds. Power can be saved by using a mixture of CMOS transistors with two or more different threshold voltages.  In the simplest form there are two different thresholds available, common called High-Vt and Low-Vt, where Vt stands for threshold voltage.  High threshold transistors are slower but leak less, and can be used in non-critical circuits.\\n*[[Power gating]]: This technique uses high Vt ''sleep transistors'' which cut-off a circuit block when the block is not switching. The sleep transistor sizing is an important design parameter. This technique, also known as MTCMOS, or Multi-Threshold CMOS reduces stand-by or leakage power, and also enables [[Iddq testing]].\\n*Long-Channel transistors:  Transistors of more than minimum length leak less, but are bigger and slower.\\n*Stacking and parking states:  Logic gates may leak differently during [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] input states (say 10 on a NAND gate, as opposed to 01).  State machines may have less leakage in certain states.\\n*Logic styles:  dynamic and static logic, for example, have different speed/power tradeoffs.\\n\\n==Logic synthesis for low power==\\n[[Logic synthesis]] can also be optimized in many ways to keep power consumption under control.  Details of the following steps can have a significant impact on power optimization:\\n*[[Clock gating]]\\n*Logic Factorization\\n*Path Balancing\\n*Technology Mapping\\n*State Encoding\\n*Finite-State Machine Decomposition\\n*[[Retiming]]\\n\\n===Power Aware EDA Support===\\n\\nThere are file formats that can be used to write design files specifying the Power intent and implementation of a design. The information in these files allow the EDA tools to automatically insert power control features and to check that the result matches the intent. The [[IEEE]] [[Design Automation Standards Committee|DASC]] provides a home for developing this format in the form of the [[IEEE P1801]] working group. During 2006 and the first two months of 2007, both [[Unified Power Format]] and [[Common Power Format]] were developed to support various tools. The [[IEEE P1801]] working groups operates with the goal of providing for convergence of these two standards.\\n\\nSeveral EDA tools have been developed for supporting architectural level power estimation including McPAT,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hpl.hp.com/research/mcpat/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203085834/http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/mcpat/ |archive-date=2011-12-03 |title=HP Labs : McPAT}}</ref> Wattch,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~dbrooks/wattch-form.html|title = Wattch Download}}</ref> and Simplepower.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cse.psu.edu/research/mdl/software/simpower/simpower/?searchterm=simplepower |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218013523/http://www.cse.psu.edu/research/mdl/software/simpower/simpower/?searchterm=simplepower |archive-date=2019-12-18 |title=SimPower — PSU CSE}}</ref>\\n\\n== See also ==\\n* [[Data organization for low power]]\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n* ''Electronic Design Automation For Integrated Circuits Handbook'', by Lavagno, Martin, and Scheffer, {{ISBN|0-8493-3096-3}} A survey of the field, from which the above summary was derived, with permission.\\n* Jan M.

{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\\n==Habitat==\\nTadpoles generally live just below the surface of the water, where light can filter through and allow plant life, in ponds, lakes, and other bodies of water. They can be found in almost all places in the world, and reside on every continent except for Antarctica. They prefer clean water sources but depend on algae for food.Juvenile frogs and tadpoles in their later stages of metamorphosis live on and/or nearer to the surface, beggining to occasionally wander away from their home as their lungs begin to develop.\\n\\nAs pets, tadpoles are housed similarly to fish, in tanks or bowls. Often they areprovided with shelter and plant life, although they are fed much like fish.\\n\\n\\n==Domestication==\\nTadpoles are occasionally domesticated as pets and projects. They are housed similarly to fish, and fed similar food. They make occasional science projects, and are often marveled at for their metamorphosis.
== Haussecker Institute for African Development ==\\n\\n== Founder ==\\nThe "Haussecker Institute for African Development" was founded by Tristan Haussecker in December of 2008. Tristan, an undergraduate [[African Studies]] major, decided to begin working on establishing an organization that would research and advocate developmental policy in rural African countries. He began his research in late 2007 uncovering facts and statistics of the Rwandan and Congolese mineral exports, educational systems, political parties, and military power. He then went on to expand his research by investigating other African countries with too many conflicts to reach their maximum economic and agricultural potential. Upon his graduation he plans to further his research in Africa before pursuing a M.A. or P.h.d in a related field.\\n\\n== Structure ==\\nThis Institute has been broken down into three main areas of research. Economic Growth, Educational Development, and Political Stabilization are the main reasons that many countries thrive. Due to the insufficient development of these key aspects in many African countries, the "Haussecker Institute" strives to research possible solutions to these problems.
Lifestylers: 49 million viewers.  This significant center of WheelsTV’s potential audience is expected to include WheelsTV in its regular viewing plans.  Lifestylers are generally well educated, affluent and upwardly mobile.  These early adopters want to know about the newest styling and performance innovations.  New vehicle unveilings, crash test reports and international auto, bike and recreational vehicle shows should bring them to WheelsTV.  Lifestylers are expected to congregate on WheelsTV when new vehicles are introduced, typically in the fall and early winter and when major automotive news occurs such as safety recalls and weather related national events.
{{underconstruction}}\\n\\n== Introduction ==\\nStudies carried out in several countries have shown that many species of bacteria, plants and animals can survive in a viable form in the ballast water and sediment carried in ships, even after journeys of several weeks duration.  Subsequent discharge of ballast water or sediment into the waters of port states may result in the establishment of colonies of harmful species and pathogens which can seriously upset the existing ecological balance.  Although other methods have been identified by which organisms are transferred between geographically separated sea areas, ballast water discharge from ships appears to have been prominent among those identified.\\n\\nThe potential for ballast water discharge to cause harm has been recognised not only by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), but also by the World Health Organization which is concerned about the role of ballast water as a medium for the spreading of epidemic disease bacteria.\\n\\n== Requirements ==\\nSome countries have established controls on the discharge of ships’ ballast water that will minimise the potential for colonisation of their rivers and estuaries by non native species.  The preferred option is mid-ocean ballast water exchange prior to arrival.  Accordingly, the countries most concerned have promulgated advice to ships for ballast management, together with a request for their co-operation in applying the techniques voluntarily.  Standard procedures have been developed that will be accepted by quarantine authorities as achieving the level of acceptability desired by the port state.\\n\\n== Conflict with Safety ==\\nUnless applied carefully some of the measures being urged for ballast management can affect a ship’s safety, either by creating forces within the hull that are greater than the design parameters, or by compromising the stability of the ship.  \\n\\nIt is because of concern about this that the IMO became involved in what would otherwise be a purely quarantine matter.  It has been recognised by governments and the shipping industry that individual countries’ needs should be harmonised with the greater need to ensure the safety of ships, their crews and passengers.\\n\\nIMO recommends that each ship should be provided with a Ballast Water Management Plan, detailing the way that the ship can comply with any measures demanded by a port state.  Once it has been established that the management of ballast is necessary to meet the quarantine requirements of a port state, preparation for it should be treated with the same seriousness as preparation of a cargo plan.   All concerned with the operation and safe passage of the ship can thereby be assured that they are both protecting the marine environment and ensuring the safety of the ship and crew.\\n\\n== Summary of records required ==\\nTo be able to demonstrate at the arrival port that the correct measures have been completed, it will be necessary to maintain a full and accurate ballast log. Even if a ship is not trading in an area where ballast water information is required, it may later prove worthwhile to have a history of what water has been carried.\\n\\n== Reporting to port states ==\\nSeveral countries have become aware of the potential, through discharge of ships’ ballast water, for the transfer into their coastal areas of what are found to be harmful aquatic organisms.   Governments have recognised that, before devising mandatory controls on ships, it is necessary to know the scale of what has, until very recently, been an unrecorded procedure.\\n\\nConcerned countries have therefore introduced a requirement which, though often differing in detail, generally calls for ships to report in advance, to the national monitoring authority, how much ballast water will be on board on arrival, where it was taken on board, and whether a ballast management procedure has been followed.   In most cases it is mandatory to make the report, even though the actual ballast exchange in mid-ocean (or other management procedure) remains voluntary.\\n\\n{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" align="center" style="width:70%; border:2px #a3b1bf solid; background:#ffbbbb; text-align:center;"\\n|== CAUTION ==\\nThe function of the Ballast Water Management Plan is to assist in complying with quarantine measures intended to minimise the risk of transplanting harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens from ship’s ballast water and associated sediments, while maintaining ship safety.\\nAs part of this function the plan will provide information to quarantine officers who wish to learn about a ship’s ballast handling system, or to confirm that ballast management has been effectively planned.\\nThe plan should not be used or regarded as a guide to ballasting. Training and shipboard operational practices have to be well established and all safety aspects detailed. Untrained handling of ballast water can lead to sinking and loss of life and cargo.\\n|}\\n\\n[[File:Example.jpg]]<!-- Comment -->\\n{| class="wikitable" border="1"\\n|-\\n! header 1\\n! header 2\\n! header 3\\n|-\\n| row 1, cell 1\\n| row 1, cell 2\\n| row 1, cell 3\\n|-\\n| row 2, cell 1\\n| row 2, cell 2\\n| row 2, cell 3\\n|}
Most of the poor science on these pages comes from the MAJOR misconception that diffusion is dependent on concentration gradients, mostly from bad teaching in years 7-12  of high-school biology classes! Most of this argument was clarified in 1970's by the UK Nuffield Science Project, where diffusion was, correctly, defined as RANDOM MOVEMENT of MOLECULES (particles) owing to their kinetic energy. Hence diffusion occurs all the time unless the temperature reaches 0*K.\\n\\n A concentration gradient has the effect of generating NET diffusion from the area/volume having a higher concentration of the molecules under consideration to the volume with fewer of them. However when all of the different molecular species (particles) are evenly distributed, diffusion continues with on average equal movements of all species in all directions, now however there is no NET diffusion. In living systems (and probably in some non-living artificial systems), various carriers may pick up and bind certain molecules, hence the system can maintain the concentration gradient, so NET diffusion continues "down", or as I prefer "along" the concentration gradient.\\n\\nWhy Oh why can't we teach proper science instead of a dumbed down version that leads to all of the half understood writings here? It leads to misconceptions of osmosis, and, since we now know  that living membranes are much more complex than we first believed, we need to teach correct science not a convenient but wrongly conceptualised version.
=Gaming=\\n'''The Golden Age of Gaming''' is a fictional era in gaming history, where games published were used for the sole purpose of recreation. The era is also called the "Fall of the Two", because around these times the MMO and FPS genres, probably the two most competitive ones, were slowly dying away, giving ground to games which could be enjoyed by all, regardless of age, skill, sex, etc. These games were not, however, casual games, at least not all of them, but originated from some not so well known genres, like for example the adventure and platformer games. In this period, every genre were equal, one wouldn't bring more profit to the developers, nor less, and gamers were equally interested in every genre, thus the industry became a highly lucrative and profitable investment. And despite this, developers remained independent, not letting investors control the projects to raise the profits, but doing what they wanted to, leading to more creative and entertaining games.\\n\\n=[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatitudes Blessed are]=\\nBlessed are the game developers, for they open up the door of gaming every once in a while, to show the righteous path for the astray.
Earth Stewardship is a term used to describe the human responsibility to actively engage in the care and healing of planet Earth.  Responsible Earth Stewardship requires humans to evolve towards sustainable living and engage in regenerative efforts to heal the damage that human activity has inflicted on the global environment and cultures.  \\n\\nEarth Stewardship is based upon a healthy acknowledgment of our interdependence with all life and respect for future generations.
Wikipedia needs to decide its direction. It has long endured a civil war between the inclusionists and exclusionists, who both represent competing visions for Wikipedia's future. The inclusionists believe that as bandwidth and physical data space become increasingly cheaper, the need to filter articles based on notability is unsubstantiated. Exclusionists, on the other hand, wish to bring a sense of universal validity to Wikipedia, which necessitates the banishment of obscure and popular-culture phenomena.{{Babel|en|es-1|:UBX/1337-2}}
