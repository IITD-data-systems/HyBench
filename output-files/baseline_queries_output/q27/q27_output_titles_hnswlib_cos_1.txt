\\n'''Reasons For Unemployment in Kerala'''\\n\\nIt is interesting to know that the State with the highest literacy rate — almost 97 per cent — has the highest unemployment rate when compared to others. Kerala is known for large-scale migration of skilled labour to other States and countries. \\n\\nA few millions of people of the State have been working outside it for many years. Had they remained in Kerala, the unemployment rate would have been much higher than what was quoted in the article. \\n\\nWhat ails the State that has such a high literacy rate and is also blessed by vast natural resources? \\n\\nDoes the education system make people lethargic or rights-conscious or inefficient or unenterprising to start productive activities for their own progress? Does the education system make people more destructive in nature? \\n\\nNo industrialist wants to set up any industry in Kerala due to labour problems. The State is bankrupt, besides being corrupt and largely politicised. Trade unionism is still alive in Kerala. West Bengal was industrially ruined by the same attitude of the workers despite a highly skilled labour force. \\n\\nInstead of migrating to other States for jobs, Keralites should use their knowledge and expertise in establishing new productive activity on their own. Many of them should look at self-employment for overcoming the serious problem of unemployment.
'''PRANAV'''\\nThe Changing Nature Of Festivals – Fun Or Rituals? \\nPeople from different religions and regions all over India celebrate a number of festivals – religious, cultural and social. The celebrations of such festivals help people come together, shed their egos and the consciousness of individual identities and results in integration. Man is a social animal. He has formed a society and has maintained his own culture. Culture clubs together religion, territorial necessities and requirements of nature and civilisation. The essence of culture can be seen in many festivals. Festivals celebrated all over India follow different regional traditions. Common festivals celebrated in India are Raksha-Bandhan, Navratri, Rangpanchami, Ganesh Utsav etc.In recent years there has been some criticism about the supposedly excessive use of firecrackers, especially during the Hindu festival of Deepavali. The most commonly cited reason is the noise pollution caused by firecrackers.The noise from firecrackers has a more deleterious effect on animals who have a more sensitive sense of hearing than humans. Pets such as dogs and cats, as well as stray cattle in and around cities are most affected. Voluntary and non-profit organizations such as People for Animals educate the public about these issues.Another criticism is that smog caused by firecrackers may be harmful to inhale and can cause difficulty for drivers because of reduced visibility. The usage of "rockets" near apartment buildings has also given rise to many injuries. No law prohibiting this has been passed.
12forests, was founded in Chicago, IL, in 2008. The focus of the organization is  to help the world end exploitation and its causes. It uses proven vedic and yogic methodologies, to distribute karma free vegetarian food, educate and develop sustainable villages. Its outlook is always wide, focusing on how the world views the environment and all living beings.  Understanding the importance of clean and safe environment it introduces everyone to proven strategies of simple development based on cows and land.  12forests which comes from an extensive research background on the importance of cows, as seen in ayurveda and yoga.  The dung and urine of the cow provides for an antiseptic environment which would help third world countries counteract the threats of unsanitary conditions.  Also, it helps to set aside petroleum based and human feces fertilizers as used in the USA and Mexico.  These fertilizers have caused countless deaths in the form of e.coli and cancers, and not to speak of destroying water supplies.  So based on the highest scientific models 12forests is helping poverty stricken children, families and the environment from forced degradation.\\n<ref>12forests.org</ref>
	Abortion has become one of the most divisive issues in American society today, and differing opinions often lead to heated discussions, political division, and even violence.Ever since the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v Wade, this controversial issue has split the nation. Some people agree with Roe and support abortion, others are against it. It is obviously a problem that needs to be solved, and quickly.\\n        The battle over abortion has been going on for a very long time, but really came to public view after the supreme court decision in Roe v Wade.  In this case, a woman whom the court discretely called "Jane Roe" sued in order for women to be able to legally have abortions, even if not in a life threatening situation. The court ruled in her favor, but since then there have been multiple attempts to overturn their decision.
In Alaska, the significant variation in both climate and population make standard architectural applications impractical. The summer months in Alaska draw in more than half of the yearly income for the state due to the increase in construction, commercial fishing, logging and mining, and the tourism industry.  In some regions, including southeastern Alaska, the population fluctuates as much as two thirds from January to July.  This irregularity creates a huge strain on the city especially in the realm of housing.  The majority of the seasonal population is currently expected to live in modular housing units fabricated to withstand less than three years, demanding an unbelievable amount of government funds that could be used elsewhere for city development.  Not only is this economically and environmentally unsound, but it provides only the bare necessities for this population.  This is why a seasonal housing facility is pivotal to the success of the state as a whole and specifically to those cities with a large seasonal population.  The large variation in population between the summer and winter months has created a need for housing types that can “hibernate” seasonally to reduce the amount of necessary energy and maintenance. Not only would this produce a more suitable and environmentally conscious method of housing the seasonal population, but also increase the possibility of permanent residence through an increase in the quality of life.  Although the application of seasonal buildings would be beneficial to most cities in the state of Alaska because of the migration patterns of the seasonal populations, the city of Juneau is particularly affected.  This city, the state’s capital, looses almost one third of its population in this seasonal shift, and yet has maintained a significant role in the economic success of the state.   However, Juneau suffers from housing shortages, urban sprawl and unfavorable living conditions.  This is why the application of a fluctuating, multifamily housing facility would accommodate the seasonal population, densify the current population, and employ environmentally responsive technology to help reduce the overall cost of living.  The success of the proposed building type would change the face of Alaskan housing and address the housing crisis that has for so long gone unaddressed. \\n  The underdevelopment of Alaska is often attributed to the unusual conditions of its latitude including dramatic variation in sunlight hours and harsh weather conditions.  However, this argument is undermined when compared to other cities at the same 60oN Latitude.  Glasgow, Scotland, St. Petersburg, Russia, and Stockholm, Sweden are all located within 5 degrees of the latitude of Juneau Alaska, and all are very established ranging in population from .5-5 million.  In addition, these cities are all major contributor to the overall GDP of their respective countries. The city layouts demonstrate the success of the area with the densely build scheme.  The feature of these cities that is not shared by Juneau is the topography.  All of these cities have a very flat landscape making development much less difficult and also ease in the circulation through and into the region.  It can then be concluded that in Alaska the topographical challenge is more detrimental to the development of the state than the cold climate. \\nThe land area of Alaska is 656425 square miles making it account for almost 20% of the total land area of the United States.  It is by far the largest state at more than 60% the size of Texas, 75% the size of California, and 93% larger than Pennsylvania, and yet is one of the most underdeveloped and underutilized areas in the nation.   The land features significant natural resources and the largest amount of coast line out of any other state in the United States.  \\n\\nThe average population of the United States falls just above 304 million.  The average population per state is just above 6 million, and yet the largest state, that which encompasses almost 1/5 of the United States territory has only 626, 932 inhabitants, almost half of the population of Rhode Island.  These numbers are even more significant when one compares the population density of various states.  Alaska with its vast lands and miniscule population is by far the least dense, having an average of only 1.2 residents per square mile. \\nThe states chosen for comparison have a wide variety of geographic and climatic aspects which shows the diversity of population density over the nation, but none even comes close to the discrepancy between these numbers and those exhibited in the region of Alaska.  It is also strange that Alaska’s proximity to the Pacific Northwest, the religion currently experiencing the largest national population growth, has not more directly affected the influx into this adjacent territory.\\n	The economic trends in the United States have a very significant impact on the economy of Alaska.  The trend over the last 30 years has consistently demonstrated this relationship.  During times of economic turmoil in the US, namely recessions, the migration to Alaska increases drastically.  This is largely due to the more stable job market in Alaska, one that operates more independently from other states in the nation.  The lower chart shows the average state GDP vs. various state’s GDP.   The GDP of Alaska is above the US average.  This should result in a higher population due to a more stable economy, as is the trend in the United States, yet the result is inconsistent in Alaska. \\nThe city of Juneau offers a variety of locations that would benefit from the establishment of a large scale housing facility.  This is largely due to the fact that housing development is currently sprawling into the outskirts of the city lines because of cheap and more buildable land.  This has expanded the city limits, but not the density or even overall population.  In addition to sprawl, in the last 30 years the center of Juneau has shifted from the historic downtown area to the land surround the airport.  Unfortunately this diversion has left the downtown in disrepair.  The migration has occurred because the land surround the downtown area is more difficult to build upon, making construction of single family homes more expensive, and because of the significance of the Juneau Airport as a primary gateway into the state of Alaska.  The city is essentially being split in half socially and industrially.  Reorganizing the city development of the city to focus on the historical downtown area would help preserve the city as a destination and not merely a transit hub.  Locating a housing facility in this area would help facilitate this effort, making it more affordable to establish residence.  It would also reduce the need for public transportation because the majority of employment, especially tourism and government based professions, occurs in this section of the city. \\nThe intended program to be developed on this site is a large scale housing facility.  This facility will cater to a variety of people with different needs throughout the city of Juneau.  The core of the facility will be made up of two and three bedroom units that correspond with the current housing market demand in the area.  In addition to these standard units, a portion of the development will be dedicated to affordable housing units to accommodate the portion of the population that is below the poverty line, including a large portion of the native population in and around Juneau.  In addition, a portion of the units will be seasonally adjustable creating a facility that can fluctuate either physically or systematically to accommodate the seasonal population influx.   This portion of the structure will not merely be cut off from the establishment when not in use, but like the city, will change in use to enhance the facility for the permanent residents.  The establishment of a stable and changing population could be a mutually advantageous relationship. The permanent residents help reduce the maintenance and upkeep to the temporary facilities during the off season and in turn receive a portion of the profit from the seasonal residents.  This relationship would change the dynamic between the two groups are result in a more community centered organization.  In addition to housing units, the facility will include amenities that not only increase its desirability for both temporary and permanent residents, but also work to draw in the surrounding community and population of downtown Juneau.  These amenities will be defined and located in a way to ensure security for the residents while still increasing public circulation to and through the building.  The facility will also be developed in a way that is environmentally sensitive in design and perception.  It will capitalize on the aesthetically unique features of the context and utilize the favorable site conditions to become more self sustaining.  The development of a successful housing system will increase the density in downtown Juneau and provide the citizens with a more habitable and experientially significant living experience.\\n<ref>http://ruralhealth.hrsa.gov/pub/seasonalpopulation.asp#Case1.

What are Prayer Wheels?\\n\\n   Prayer wheels contain the words of the Buddha: teachings of wisdom and compassion. While the Buddha's discourses fill many volumes, they may also be condensed into syllables with deep symbolic meaning known as mantra. Tibetans recite these profound and inspiring texts to instill them in memory and promote the well­being of others. \\n\\n   The Tibetan term "dharma wheel" has been rendered into English as "prayer wheel". Yet prayer wheels are much more than supplicants to a higher spirit. They can contain the full potency and meaning of the path to enlightenment.\\n\\n   Believing that turning dharma wheels filled with these texts and symbols is equivalent to reciting them, Tibetans place dharma wheels in monasteries, temples, and libraries and turn them at every opportunity to convey the blessings of compassion and harmony, prevent natural disasters, and promote peace in the world. Although dharma wheels were known in ancient India and Nepal, only in Tibet did they become an integral part of daily life. Today as in ages past, the dharma wheels are honored as symbols of enlightened knowledge, able to evoke the healing powers of the mind and increase its capacities for wisdom.\\n\\n   In recent years, the world has seen how quickly knowledge-even when valued and protected by an entire culture-can be brought to the brink of extinction. In response, we have made great efforts to preserve the cultural heritage of Tibet, including the intricate science of dharma wheels, which are in themselves ways of preserving and disseminating the benefits of enlightened knowledge. Having created more than a thousand 4 foot high wheels for our own organization and donated 100,000 of the hand-held wheels to individuals in the Himalayan region, we have come to share the view that dharma wheels have a calming and healing influence on the environment and human beings, qualities greatly needed in our world today.
Timber framed boat docks are toxic playgrounds.  In 2001, the EPA banned \\narsenic treated wood from our children’s playgrounds because of the deadly \\nhazards of exposure.  Yet, treated timbers are still being used to build boat \\ndocks in many areas throughout the country.  These timbers continuer to leach \\ndeadly toxins year after year.\\n\\nPressure-treated boards and timbers are leaking poisonous arsenic into our \\nsoil and waterways.  The arsenic comes from 'chromated copper arsenate', CCA, \\nan infusion of pesticides, fungicides, and preservatives to delay the natural \\ndecaying process of wood.  These known carcinogens, have been linked to many \\ncancers, poisonings, severe skin rashes, and many other health issues.\\n\\nCCA treated wood, a very common boat dock building material, exposes us to \\nunnecessary danger when we are most vulnerable.  Barely clothed, barefoot, and \\nwet the very waters around these docks continually wash the treated surfaces \\nwhere we play.  All reports and handling guidelines suggest we were gloves, \\nglasses, and long sleeve shirts when handling CCA treated wood.  Yet, once in \\nplace as our waterfront play ground, we can't expect our children to go \\nswimming with so much protection.\\n\\nMore than 30 million pounds of pure arsenic comes  into the U.S. each year. \\nMuch of this is used in treating wood and timbers that will be used in dock \\nconstruction. Ultimately, the vast majority of this will end up in local \\nlandfills where it can leach into soil and local waterways.\\n[[User:Saveourwaters|Saveourwaters]] ([[User talk:Saveourwaters|talk]]) 00:03, 4 June 2008 (UTC)Lin Rimple
== Recycing- the need ==\\n\\n<br />The need for recycling has greatened over the past thirty years as the realisation of global warming has spread throughout the governments of the world. As the threat of rising sea levels, unstable weather conditions and ultimately a heating world creeps upon mankind, some people have decided to take action while others take a back seat. Whatever attitude the world has the simple fact is that changes in the climate are happening and recycling and other methods can contribute to limit the effect of global warming.\\n<br />\\n*[[global warming-overview]]\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n== Global warming-overview==\\nGlobal warming is occurring throughout the world because of increased levels of Carbon Dioxide being emmitted has caused (it is widely believed) the o-zone layer to thicken therefore trapping the suns energy inside the earths atmosphere and heating the earth accordingly.
'''Aquati Equini'''\\nThe Planet of Water!\\n&\\nThe Ancient City of Atlantis!\\n<gallery>\\nImage:Example.jpg|Caption1\\n</gallery>\\n\\nThe Earth as we know today is millions of years old and has undergone many transformations and metamorphic changes. Our planet Aquati Equini the "Earth" and its evolution of the ecosystem, with its physical and spiritual beings is the third planet from the Sun, and the largest of the terrestrial planets in the Solar System in terms of diameter, mass and density. It is also referred to as the World, the Blue Planet, and Terra continues to evolve.It is in the physical world (the third dimension of reality or so called duality)we find ourselves in a world of constant change and unstable eventuality.\\n\\nHome to millions of species,including humans, Earth is the only place in the universe where we find life is known to exist today. The planet formed 4.54 billion years ago,and life appeared on its surface within a billion years. Since then, Earth's biosphere has significantly altered the atmosphere and other abiotic conditions on the planet, enabling the proliferation of aerobic organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which, together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks harmful radiation, permitting life on land.The physical properties of the Earth, as well as its geological history and orbit, allowed life to persist during this period. The world is expected to continue supporting life for another 1.5 billion years, after which the rising luminosity of the Sun will eliminate the biosphere.\\n\\n----\\n\\nMR
A scientific phrase used to explain the recent phenomenon of the gradual cooling of the Gulf Stream.  The phrase comes from the noted effect of heat exchange in the blood flow in the reindeer's body.  In order to conserve warmth, the blood flowing ethrough the legs of a reindeer is considerably colder than that of the rest of it's body.  This is achieved by a heat exchange system; see http://library.thinkquest.org/3500/caribou.html for more details.\\nThis effect has been used to describe the recently discovered cooling of the Gulf Stream while the original equatorial currents have remained of the same temperature.  Over the last 20 years the temperature of the Gulf Stream (passing from the coast of South America up through the Atlantic and past the British Isles) has been studied by scientists in Scotland.  A recent report, published by both the Scientific Institute for Climate Research and Greenpeace, states that the temperature of the Gulf Stream near Scotland has dropped by three degrees celsius over twenty years and by two degrees over the last ten years.  This accelerated cooling has been attributed to the melting of the arctic ice shelf but is disputed by many scientists, mostly in America, where the report has been met with some incredulity.  See the Greenpeace website for a full version of the report.
Although the company labels itself as being environmentally friendly, but BP a major cause of pollution, actually ranked within the top ten worst environmentally friendly corporations. The company is a accused of greenwashing. BP changed its name from British Petroleum to BP, standing for "beyond petroleum" and adopted a yellow sunflower similar to that of the Canadian Green Party symbol. They appear to be green but in fact, none of these green symbols properly portray the company. \\n\\nBetween January 1997 and March 1998, the company was responsible for 104 oil spills and has also been charged for burying polluted gases. The company has also been permitted to dump nearly two-thousand pounds of ammonia and almost five thousand pounds into Lake Michigan everyday. BP allowed 270,000 gallons of oil to spread into the Alaskan tundra, and only admitted to doing so after they were confronted by journalists. BP is responsible for fifteen deaths after one of their oil refineries in Texas exploded. It's also been reported that BP is responsible for spilling nearly two thousand gallons of chemicals onto frozen tundra in Alaska. The chemicals that spilled are poisonous to plants and aniamls, and will melt the tundra. \\n\\nBP does not have good environmental standing. The company donataes over five million dollars to political campaigns, possibly an effort of stay in business and be exempt from US laws. They are guilty of killing and harming the planet, not just in the United States but all over the globe. They are listed as one of Scotland's largest polluters.
The U.S. frequently uses its economic power in order to punish other countries.  One of the ways the U.S. does this is by holding back on exporting food.   Reasons for the punishment of another country vary; however, they can be broken down into two main groups: Foreign containment objective and market development/humanitarian objectives.  The foreign containment objective tends to punish those countries who are threatening to the U.S.  An example of such a threat would be countries under other forms of government.   More examples related to the containment objective would be:  no aid to communist countries, no aid to socialist governments, no aid to countries who support radical regimes, no aid to regimes with an inadequate democracy who are too weak to be anti-communist (effectively), no aid to countries who will not accept U.S. agreements.  An example of market development and humanitarian objectives would fall under a category of countries that are trying to compete with the U.S. economically.  The U.S. will execute foreign aid punishments to countries trying to nationalize property of U.S. companies, countries who want to take over functions by U.S. companies, and countries trying to initiate nationalistic economic policies.
Hemostasis is the arrest of bleeding by the physiological properties of vasoconstriction and coagulation; or more simply, blood clotting. \\nFor our Wiki project we would like to take a closer look at the Hemostasis process, how it happens, and what factors in and outside of the body affect it. By understanding how it works on a cellular level we would like to find out how other things in our bodies can affect it, such as vasoconstriction, vasodilation, age, and the heart. We would like to find out what proteins play a major role in the  hemostasis process and if by adding or taking away certain nutrients can greatly affect the hemostatic response. As far as outside influences we want to figure out the negative and positive effects of different drugs, and certain diseases such as Von Willebrand’s disease and Thrombophilia. \\nBy understanding how the process works and what factors change the response, we believe we can provide an adequate response and a description of how hemostasis works in correlation with the rest of the body.
My report on Thoroughbreds so far:\\n\\nThoroughbreds have a well-chiseled head. Thoroughbreds are considered a hot-blooded horse because of their agility, speed, and spirit.\\n\\nThe thoroughbred that is known today was developed in the 17th and the 18th century, which was 1600 and 1700. All modern Thoroughbreds can find their pedigrees to three stallions originally transported into England in the 1600s and 1700s. During the 1800s and the 1700s, the Thoroughbred breed went around the world. Many thoroughbreds exist worldwide today ,with over 118,000 people registered each year worldwide.   \\n\\nThoroughbreds are usually used for racing but also bred for other riding disciplines, such as show jumping, combined training, and more. They are also cross-bred with other breeds to create new breeds or improve existing breeds.\\n\\nThoroughbred racehorses perform with maximum effort, which has resulted on high rates of accidents and other health problems. Also, thoroughbreds are prone to other health problems, including bleeding from the lungs, small hearts, and more. There are several theories for the reasons behind the frequency of accidents and health problems in the  thoroughbred breed, and research continues into how to reduce the accident rate and treat those animals that are injured.\\n\\nThoroughbreds are most often bay, seal brown, chestnut, black, or gray. The less common colors that are recognized in the United States are roan, palomino, and more. White is not seen that much, but it is also known color separate from the gray.
\\n\\nDual-coding theory, a theory of cognition, was first advanced by Allan Paivio of the University of Western Ontario in 1971. The theory postulates that both visual and verbal information are processed differently and along distinct channels with the human mind creating separate representations for information processed in each channel. Both visual and verbal codes for representing information are used to organize incoming information into knowledge that can be acted upon, stored, and retrieved for subsequent use.\\nEach channel also has limitations. For example, humans have difficulty simultaneously attending to multiple auditory or visual cues, depending on expertise with the task or prior knowledge with the subject area. For example, a television documentary that shows images of plant and animal life in a rain forest while also simultaneously providing narration that describes the animal life could potentially provide for improved learning using the dual-code theory because the visual and verbal information does not compete with each other.\\nA multimedia presentation that shows multiple visuals such as an image of a speaker as well as the text that the speaker is reading, such as a series of bullet points, could overwhelm the viewer, depending on the person and the situation, because the viewer must now attend to two images.
'''Groundwork'''\\n\\nEstablished in 1981, Groundwork is a voluntary environmental organisation, dedicated to the preservation of some of Ireland's most precious habitats: the oak woodlands in Killarney National Park, Co. Kerry.\\n\\nMost of Groundwork’s focus has been on the removal of the invasive Rhododendron ponticum from Killarney National Park.\\n\\nThe unique ecology of the Killarney oak woodlands is seriously threatened by the invasion of Rhododendron ponticum. This non-native shrub thrives in the mild and moist conditions in Killarney and can spread rapidly especially where soils are acidic. Within 25 years rhododendron can form impenetrable thickets with plants up to six metres in height. These thickets cast such a dense shade that almost nothing can grow beneath them. This prevents the regeneration of the oakwoods.\\n\\nDuring the last 27 years Groundwork has changed from a small group of environmentally-concerned Irish students to an organisation attracting conservation-minded people from all over the world to carry out voluntary work in one of Ireland's most beautiful natural landscapes.\\n\\nSee http://www.groundwork.ie
== is the world on the end ==\\n\\nThe 2012 phenomenon comprises a range of eschatological beliefs according to which cataclysmic or transformative events will occur on December 21, 2012.[1][2][3][4] This date is regarded as the end-date of a 5,125-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae have been proposed as pertaining to this date, though none have been accepted by mainstream scholarship.\\nA New Age interpretation of this transition is that this date marks the start of time in which Earth and its inhabitants may undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 2012 may mark the beginning of a new era.[5] Others suggest that the 2012 date marks the end of the world or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world include the arrival of the next solar maximum, or Earth's collision with a black hole, passing asteroid or a planet called "Nibiru".\\nScholars from various disciplines have dismissed the idea of such cataclysmic events occurring in 2012. Professional Mayanist scholars state that predictions of impending doom are not found in any of the extant classic Maya accounts, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar "ends" in 2012 misrepresents Maya history and culture.[3][6][7] Astronomers and other scientists have rejected the proposed events as pseudoscience, stating that they are contradicted by simple astronomical observations.[8]
Overview\\nThe United States is the world’s largest producer of beef, according to the USDA. The United States also has the largest fed-cattle industry in the world, primarily high-quality, grain-fed beef used for both domestic and export use.\\n\\nThe U.S. beef industry has undergone massive improvements in overall system efficiency. High-quality beef continues to flow to consumers even as the overall cattle and calf inventory has dropped from 130 million in 1975 to 92.6 million in 2011 (NASS). This is occurring because of significant improvements to genetics, which has virtually doubled the weaning weights since the 1960s and has made it possible to consistently deliver an animal that has gained 1,000 pounds each month since birth. The other efficiency gains have been made through technology, including growth implants with strategies to optimize their use. Also, industry consolidation has led to more comprehensive use of parasite control, mineral supplementation, good feedbunk management, optimization of rebreeding cycles and much more.\\n\\nLike most commodity production, cattle and beef are subjected to a cyclical pattern of production: a series of peaks and valleys in herd size and production that typically lasts from eight to 12 years. This cycle of production is counter-cyclical to the price. These cycles fall heaviest on the cow/calf sector, which has no real margin recourse or an ability to manage supply effectively. In beef production, large amounts of grain are fed to the animals, so the cattle cycle is affected by the price and supplies of grain as well. Today, we see the effects of foreign trade and the politics of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or more commonly, mad cow disease) dramatically influencing price. While exports generally amount to 7 percent of total beef sales, the effect on price can be dramatic and has been a significant drag on what should be a higher market at this time.\\n\\nThe cattle industry plays an integral role in the country’s economic growth and well being. More than one million cattlemen and women do business in a free-market economy and represent the largest single segment of American agriculture.\\n\\nThe 2007 U.S. Census of Agriculture found that the largest single segment of the U.S. agricultural economy is beef production, with cattle and calves representing about 21 percent of total farm sales.\\n\\nAccording to the American Farm Bureau Federation, agriculture is responsible for approximately 21 million jobs—everything from growing the food to selling it in the supermarket. Beef production itself is a major employer, with more than 186,000 full-time jobs on farms and ranches creating more than 1 million more jobs throughout the economy.\\n\\nDemand\\nBeef consumption in the United States averaged 61.2 pounds per person in 2008, down from 65 pounds in 2000 (ERS 2008). According to USDA, U.S. consumers continue to purchase more meat with a smaller proportion of disposable income, continuing the long-term trend. ERS predicts that over the next 10 years, meat purchases will decline from about 2 percent to 1.3 percent of disposable income. As of 2007, meat purchases accounted for 1.7 percent of disposable personal income and 30 percent of total food expenditures.\\n\\nA USDA study concluded that almost 65 percent of all beef was purchased at retail stores for at-home consumption. Ground beef ranked first for at-home consumption followed by steaks. On average, consumers purchased 43 pounds of beef from retail stores. Ground beef consumed at restaurants accounted for 60 percent of the beef eaten away from home. Consumers purchased more than 23 pounds of beef away from home a year.\\n\\nProduction\\nOn January 1, 2011, the inventory of U.S. beef cows was 30.9 million head, down 2 percent from January 1, 2010. Beef replacement heifers totaled 5.2 million head, down 5 percent. Cattle and calves on feed for slaughter in all feedlots totaled 14 million, up 3 percent.  (NASS 2011)\\n\\nNearly 70 percent of U.S. cattle are produced in the central region of the country, extending from North Dakota to Texas and from South Dakota to Tennessee. According to the 2007 Census of Agriculture, there were 687,540 beef cattle operations in the United States. Texas hosts the largest number of beef operations (131,769), followed by Missouri (51,289), Oklahoma (47,059) and Tennessee (42,344).\\n\\nNebraska, Iowa and Kansas host the largest number of feedlots, but Texas, Kansas, Nebraska and Colorado market the most cattle annually, that is, 5.7 million head, 5.1 million head, 4.8 million head and 1.9 million head, respectively.\\n\\nIn their U.S. Baseline Briefing Book, University of Missouri experts noted that beef demand should strengthen as the U.S. economy recovers.   \\n \\nProcessing\\nBeef production totaled 26.4 billion pounds in 2010, up 1 percent from the previous year. Commercial cattle slaughter during 2010 totaled 34.2 million head, up 3 percent from 2009. The average live weight was 1,279 pounds, down 14 pounds from a year ago. Steers comprised 49.2 percent of the total federally inspected cattle slaughter, heifers 29.8 percent, other cows 10.8 percent, dairy cows 8.3 percent and bulls 1.8 percent. \\n\\nIn their Meat and Poultry Facts 2008, AMI experts speculated that beef slaughter rates will stall, triggering a reconfiguration of the beef packing industry. A South American firm, JBS, purchased two U.S. beef packers in 2008: Swift & Company and Smithfield Beef Group. Barring further consolidation, JBS is likely to dominate the industry in the coming years.\\n\\nAccording to NASS, 632 of the 841 plants operating under federal inspection slaughtered cattle. The 14 largest plants slaughtered 55 percent of the total cattle killed in 2010. In 2006, the four largest plants slaughtered nearly 70 percent of all cattle commercially slaughtered.\\n\\nTop Ten Beef Packers\\nCompany Name and Location 	Daily Capacity\\n\\nTyson Foods, Arkansas\\n	27,375\\nJBS Swift1, Colorado 	26,050\\nCargill Meat Solutions, Kansas 	25,850\\nNational Beef Packing Co., Missouri 	13,100\\nAmerican Foods Group, Minnesota 	5,575\\nNebraska Beef, Nebraska 	3,000\\nGreater Omaha Packing, Nebraska 	2,650\\nXL Beef 	2,200\\n\\nCaviness\\n	1,700\\nCreekstone, Kansas 	1,600\\n1JBS acquired Smithfield Beef Group in October 2008.\\nSource: Meat and Poultry Facts, AMI, January 2010.\\n\\nExports\\nOverall, the U.S. beef industry exported 726,229 metric tons (MT) of beef and veal valued at $3.4 billion. Top buyers, accounting for more than half of the U.S. beef exports, were Mexico, Canada, Japan and South Korea. In 2010, Brazil and Australia exported more beef than the United States. However, these countries primarily graze their cattle on pasture rather than feed them grain.  \\n \\nFactors allowing for the upward momentum in the U.S. beef export market, according to USDA, include the weak dollar and strong economic recovery in the rest of the world, coupled with tightened supplies of competing beef. USDA estimated total U.S. beef exports for 2011 at 2.43 billion pounds or 9.3 percent of U.S. production. \\n\\nImports\\nThe United States remains a net importer of beef. According to FAS, the United States imported 768,558 MT of beef and veal valued at $2.8 billion. Canada continued to rank as the largest supplier of fresh/chilled beef into the United States in 2010, closely followed by Australia.\\n\\nCompetitive Analysis\\nIn terms of red meat expenditures in 2007, Americans spent $270.42 per person on beef (AMI). According to the USDA, U.S. consumers spent $159.37 per person on poultry that year.\\n\\nBeef has traditionally competed with the pork industry for per capita meat consumption with United States and global consumers. However, the poultry industry has increased in per capita meat consumption and the amount of disposable income spent on meat at a greater rate than beef or pork. This trend is attributed in part to the rapid development of convenient poultry products. As more and more consumers work outside the home, convenience and ease of preparation become an issue for the meat industry. Price is also a consideration. \\n\\nValue-added Opportunities\\nBecause the cyclical nature of the beef industry leads to over-supplies and depressed prices, many producers look for alternatives to market their cattle versus the traditional live commodity markets.\\n\\nOrganic Beef\\nDuring the 1990s, organic farming became one of the fastest growing segments of U.S. agriculture. The United States had 43,782 beef cattle certified organic in 2008, up from 20,285 beef cows in 2003. USDA organic standards were implemented in 2002. The United States had 1.85 million acres of pasture and rangeland certified organic in 2008. \\n\\nWhy the large increase in organic beef? Many producers feel it is a good way to lower input costs, decrease reliance on nonrenewable resources, capture high-value markets with premium prices and boost farm income. Organic beef production is based on a system of farming that maintains and replenishes soil fertility without the use of pesticides and fertilizers. Organic beef is minimally processed without artificial ingredients, preservatives or irradiation. For more information on organic beef, please see the Organic Beef section of the Web site.\\n \\nNatural Beef\\nNatural does not have the same strict interpretation as organic does. According to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, all fresh meat qualifies as “natural,” but those labeled “natural” cannot contain any artificial flavor or flavoring, coloring ingredient, chemical preservatives or any other artificial or synthetic ingredient; and the product and its ingredients are not more than minimally processed (ground, for example). Some companies promote their beef as natural because the cattle were not exposed to antibiotics or hormones and were totally raised on a range instead of being “finished” in a feedlot.\\n\\nResearch conducted at Kansas State University has shown that consumers tended to associate natural beef with local, family farms and perceived an increased value from that aspect. Research shows that some suburban, higher income consumers in some regions are willing to pay more for natural beef cuts from the loin. This is a growing market but still a small percentage of total U.S. meat sales.\\n \\nFor more information on natural beef, please see the Natural Beef section of the Web site.\\n \\nBranded/Certified/Verified\\nTraceability, tracking the product from its origin through processing, is becoming a competitive advantage to today’s meat suppliers. Product quality attributes or the actual manufacturing process is verified or certified by a third party.\\n\\nSuch programs may become increasingly important as the food industry makes further attempts to appeal to the social consciousness of consumers. According to USDA, the top three U.S. restaurant franchises place restrictions on how animals used in the companies’ foods are produced, accounting for approximately 35 percent of franchised restaurant sales.\\n\\nFor more information, please visit the Branded/Certified/Verified section of the Web site.\\n \\nDirect Market Beef\\nDirect marketing is selling food and farm products directly to consumers without using an intermediary. This may include direct sales to grocery stores, restaurants, door-to-door and freezer sales and Internet marketing.\\n\\nDirect marketing of livestock products is not as common as other vegetables and melons, for example, because livestock require further processing. The percentage of farms with direct sales was higher in more urbanized counties.\\n\\nHowever, direct marketing can provide prices for producers higher than typical wholesale prices, yet below supermarket prices. Interest in food safety, the environment and alternative agriculture has also supported this growth. Consumers enjoy dealing face-to-face with the producers of the products they are purchasing.\\n\\n\\n"Pastured, or free range, poultry" refers to a poultry production system that is characterized by chickens, turkeys or ducks being raised primarily on pasture. The birds supplement their grain feed by foraging for up to 20 percent of their intake and are often moved regularly to fresh pasture.\\n\\nPastured poultry is a niche market that taps into increased consumer demand for more natural and humanely raised protein sources. Consumers demanding this type of poultry product are generally willing to pay more for the system, which includes raising poultry on grassy pasture to deliver a product that is considered by many consumers to be healthier and tastier, as well as more environmentally sound. Pastured poultry production generally has lower entry costs and thus is attractive to smaller or limited resource farmers.\\n\\nMarketing\\nPastured poultry also taps into the growing natural foods market. Like the natural foods market, the certified organic food market is quite similar in terms of consumer demands and characteristics. The Food Marketing Institute found that 59 percent of consumers look for and purchase products labeled as natural, and 37 percent look for and purchase products labeled as organic. Nutrition Business Journal estimated “natural” and organic food and beverage sales reached $28.2 billion in 2006, a 14.1 percent increase from 2005. However, the same publication found that organic meat sales were 24 percent of the total. While not all pastured poultry is certified organic, comparing the markets can be helpful in determining overall general tendencies in consumer demand.\\n\\nFoods with a "natural" label had $22.3 billion in sales in 2008, according to "Healthy Eating Report for 2008" from the Nielsen Company, New York. The organic food industry, meanwhile, grew to more than $28.6 million in 2010, according to the Organic Trade Association.\\n\\nFarmers' markets are being used as an important marketing outlet for many smaller direct marketing poultry producers. Producers often receive their highest prices at these markets, followed by restaurants. Retail and other sales return the lowest prices.\\n\\nSmall-scale producers sold nearly 50 percent of their chickens directly from their farm. Large-scale producers, defined as producers raising more than 4,000 chickens a year, sold a greater proportion of their chickens to restaurants and retail outlets. \\n\\nThis growth trend in farmers' markets supports the growing consumer demand for direct-marketed, small-scale production techniques such as free range or pastured poultry. For instance, farmers' market consumers are requesting more information about how products were grown and if they were grown organically. According to a 2004 Economic Research Service (ERS) publication, when 210 farmers' market managers were polled, customers with a strong demand for organic products were also interested in environmental and social issues within agriculture, including sustainable development, environmental pollution and wildlife protection. These factors support expanded marketing opportunities for small-scale poultry production such as pastured and free range.\\n\\nPastured meat products and the growth of that market can also be attributed to the fact that a growing number of consumers support smaller farmers, are opposed to livestock raised in confinement and have a set of values that prefer animal products resulting from a pastured system.\\n\\nIn its "America’s Changing Appetite: Food Consumption and Spending to 2020" report, the Economic Research Service (ERS 2002) concluded that U.S. consumers would be demanding more quality due to increased population and an increase in educational attainment and wealth. Quality purchases look at differentiated products and include foods marketed with specific production techniques such as pastured poultry, for instance. Consumers are demanding higher quality, healthy foods, and they are increasingly demanding to know that their food is safe. They also want assurances from agricultural producers, retailers and foodservice workers about how the food was grown and what production techniques were used.\\n\\nAccording to the same ERS study, total poultry purchases are expected to have market growth of 19 percent for at-home meals and 18 percent for away-from-home meals. If specific qualities such as environmental concerns and animal welfare continue to gain consumer support, these types of production systems will provide a growing market for pastured poultry producers.\\n\\nDemand\\nAccording to the National Chicken Council, U.S. consumption of chicken steadily increased from 2000 until peaking at 87.7 pounds per person in 2006. Chicken consumption was 83.8 pounds per person in 2009. Chicken has passed beef and is currently the most consumed meat.\\n\\nProduction\\nThe many management alternatives available to poultry producers are as follows:\\n\\n    * Portable houses\\n    * Pasture pens\\n    * Integrated systems\\n\\nThousands of small farms in the United States and worldwide produce what is called "pastured poultry." To these farmers, pastured poultry means chickens and other poultry raised right on top of living grasses. As long as they get all the grass they want, poultry can qualify to be called grass fed. This is accomplished by keeping the birds in low, wide, bottomless cages called "chicken tractors" that are moved to a new spot of fresh pasture once or more often each day.\\n\\nThe term grass-fed poultry is a larger group, of which the pastured birds are a sub-set. Among producers, grass-fed poultry means birds that are allowed to forage on as much living grasses as they desire, whether in chicken tractors, small coops surrounded by pasture, or the exclusive French "Label Rouge," or Red Label, birds.\\n\\nThe Label Rouge System\\nFor people seeking ways to increase the profit potential of free range poultry systems as a full-time enterprise, the new “Label Rouge” approach may hold promise. Popular in France since the mid-1960s, the “red label” system produces free range poultry on a larger scale and takes advantage of direct marketing opportunities. In France, Label Rouge chickens have captured 33 percent of the poultry market. Label Rouge enterprises offer independence, use lower densities of birds per housing unit, allow flock access to pasture, discourage routine medication and feature longer life spans–12 weeks–for broilers and other meat birds to reach market weight. The longer life of the birds has become a chief marketing point, along with a flavor Label Rouge proponents claim is superior. Because the Label Rouge bird is not a typical American Cornish Cross breed, because it lives longer and because, after processing, it is cooled through air chilling, people consistently notice a taste difference. Air chilling discourages cross-contamination because carcasses are hung and chilled separately rather than lying in contact in a water bath, and flavor is not compromised by chlorine, typically added to chill water in poultry processing plants to kill bacteria and other microbes.\\n\\nWhile a farmer may not be able to produce as many of these flocks per season, charging considerably more for each bird boosts profits. For more information on Label Rouge, go to http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/labelrouge.html.\\n \\nPastured poultry generally commands higher prices; therefore, the potential for profit is higher than with conventional, confinement poultry. Under this system, poultry is usually sold locally, with only minimal processing. Broilers sell for between $1.50 and $2.50 per pound, dressed weight. Turkeys sell between $1.75 and $2.50 per pound. Prices vary among producers. The price difference often depends on whether the birds are sold from the chill tank, or are bagged, weighed, labeled and ready for the freezer. Production costs are usually about 1/2 to 2/3 the sale price. Many producers do not add their labor into production costs. It is the most commonly used pasture poultry method at present.\\n \\nFree range has been practiced for a century or more. This system fell out of favor in the 1960s due to disease and predator inroads, and was mostly replaced by commercial confinement poultry production. Free Range generally means a fenced pasture surrounding the barn or poultry shelter.\\n\\nIntegrated systems focus on services that poultry can provide, such as fertilization, tillage and insect and weed control rather than only meat production. Various species of domestic animals are raised together to complement each other. Disease cycles can be broken when the same species does not occupy the same site all of the time.\\n\\nChickens need protection and shade outdoors, such as trees and bush plantings. In fact, they may not venture outdoors without it. United Kingdom studies of free range poultry suggest that the amount of sun and the time of day have the greatest impact on chicken behavior. Chickens were most active during partial sun and during the morning and late afternoon.\\n\\nChickens obtain limited nutrients from forage plants, although eggs from hens raised on legumes and grass have more omega 3 fatty acids and vitamins than eggs from hens raised only on grass. Worms and insects provide high-quality nutrients, but research suggests that modern broilers need adequate nutrients and feed supplementation.\\n\\nOne limitation of pastured poultry: in cooler climates, the birds can only be raised during the summer and early fall months. Another limitation, especially for large-scale pastured poultry operations, is labor requirements. Many tasks, such as watering and feeding, must be done by hand.  \\n\\nOften, pastured poultry is one enterprise of many for producers.\\n\\nProcessing\\nOne major concern for many producers is processing--both the availability of licensed processors and the quality of the processing. To sell across state lines, producers must have their poultry butchered at a federally inspected plant. To sell within their state, producers need only have their poultry butchered at a state-inspected plant. A thorough understanding of the appropriate state and federal laws regarding poultry processing and sales is vital for each pastured poultry producer.\\n\\nAdditionally, with global concerns over avian influenza and other livestock diseases, pastured poultry producers should be familiar with poultry diseases, their symptoms and any relevant reporting procedures surrounding disease outbreaks.\\n\\nGovernment/Regulatory Involvement\\nThe USDA does not currently have specific regulatory definitions for free range although the term is allowed on labels under certain conditions. When applying for label approval, the producer must submit a brief description of the housing, which the USDA reviews to determine that poultry have access to the outdoors for at least half their lives. In contrast, the European Union defines free range, specifying maximum stocking density, type of feed, minimum slaughter age and amount of space to go outside.\\n\\n\\nU.S. Cattle and Beef Industry,

'''Stem cells'''\\n\\nStem cells come in three diffrent variations Embryonic stem cells, Adult stem cells, and Induced pluripotent stem cells. Diseases that might be treated by transplanting cells generated from human embryonic stem cells include Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, traumatic spinal cord injury, Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, Heart disease, and vison and hearing loss.\\n\\npluripotent stem cells offer a possibility of renewable source of replacement cells and replacement tissues to a bunch of diseases , disabilities and conditions such as Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injury, burns, heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. Some disadvantages of stem cells being used in treatments include: embryonic stem cells can treat diseases and regenerating organs but they are harvested from human fetus’s sometimes the treatment might not work Ex. Somebody needs a bone marrow transplant and this transplant uses adult stem cells but then the treatment might not work because the adult stem cells die.\\n\\nStem cells show potential for many different areas of health and medical research, and studying them can help us understand how they transform into the dazzling array of specialized cells that make us what we are. Some of the most serious medical conditions, such as cancer and birth defects, are caused by problems that occur somewhere in this process. A better understanding of normal cell development will allow us to understand and perhaps correct the errors that cause these medical conditions.One kind of stem cell—human embryonic stem cells—has generated much interest and public debate. Pluripotent stem cells (cells that can develop into many different cell types of the body) are isolated from human embryos that are a few days old. Pluripotent stem cell lines have also been developed from fetal tissue (older than 8 weeks of development).
'''Default Nullification'''\\n\\nDefined.\\n\\n[[Default Nullification]] is a state constitutional amendment or legislation that automatically nullifies all federal laws and regulations until said state's legislature can take up the issue to adopt, approve, and fund, or not.  If adoption is not achieved, non-compliance (and non-funding) is the circumstance.\\n\\nDefault Nullification is a political trend developing in states across the nation in response to the rampant spending, corruption, and unresponsiveness found in Washington D.C.  Enactment of this measure would achieve the following:\\n\\n1. It would restore genuine Constitutional governance by requiring state legislatures to cease and desist in abrogating their Constitutional governing responsibilities to D.C.\\n\\n2. It would require all special interests and lobbyists in D.C. to spread out over 50 different geographical locations across the country to petition citizens for favor and taxes. \\n\\n3. It would promote genuine state diversity throughout the nation, thereby optimizing competition between states for the nation's citizens.\\n\\n4. It would have the effect of defunding and reducing governing authority in Washington D.C. \\n\\n5. Would offer the greatest opportunity for a permanent, constitutional "fix" for the Washington problem, as nullification is largely immune to Federal court rulings. States are not required to obtain federal court approval to enact nullification rights according to Article One, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, and also of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.
==Course description==\\n\\nWhy, in the midst of great affluence, are people poor, and in some cases, persistently so?  This question has captured the imagination of social scientists and social critics for over one century.  In this course, we will become intimate with some of the key theoretical, critical, and empirical writings that seek to provide insight into this enduring problem.  In the process, seminar participants will become familiar with the key issues and debates animating discussions of American sociologists: Is there a culture of poverty?  Why does poverty persist in the face of economic growth?  What accounts for the feminization and juvenilization of poverty?  Does government intervention help, or does it just make matters worse?  As seminar participants deepen their knowledge in these areas, they will learn to identify and interrogate key assumptions driving these interventions and the evolution of the field, generally, and hopefully they will begin to offer critical perspectives of their own.
Inboxication is the overwhelming feeling and resulting stress associated with the challenge of keeping up with all the information from our inboxes and the all too common addiction to these inboxes. Studies have shown that constant interruptions caused by the bleeps of our mobile phones and email systems are causing Constant Partial Attention (CPA). The increase in the number of emails recieved daily combined with the multitude of communications channels such as SMS, IM and social networking mediums is increasing the impact of Data Smog and resulting in more Information Fatigue Syndrome. More and more people are exhibiting signs of Attention Deficit Trait(ADT) as they struggle to maintain focus and reduce stress.
\\nTechnology is the making, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The word technology comes from Greek τεχνολογία (technología); from τέχνη (téchnē), meaning "art, skill, craft", and -λογία (-logía), meaning "study of-".[1] The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include construction technology, medical technology, and information technology.\\nThe human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.\\nTechnology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of the Earth and its environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.\\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.

Diversity Design is a new form of socially responsible design discipline defined by Dragan Loncar. Like ecological design that helps sustainability of the environment, or design that helps people with special needs, this form of design helps with inclusion of people marginalised by race, gender and sexual orientation. It is a subtle and non-intrusive intervention on consumer products packaging and POS to invite these minorities into the mainstream of society. As an intelligent design, it could be shy in less tolerant societies, and it could reveal itself in full glory where its features appear to be advantageous. Sometimes, with its accidental use, situations filled with light humour could arise and make otherwise unaware people think positively about diversity in nature. It also encourages conscious individuals to express their love of diversity, and therefore stretch brand's target audience to the widest corners of society. This kind of social awareness through design can create huge benefits both to businesses and community, since it's generating free publicity, otherwise hardly obtainable in this highly competitive world.

Litter can also be used as a verb. To litter means to throw (often man-made) objects onto the ground and leave them unremoved, as opposed to disposing of them properly.\\n\\nIt is a human impact on the environment and is a serious environmental issue in many countries. Litter can exist in the environment for long periods of time before degrading and be transported large distances into the world's oceans. Litter can affect quality of life.\\n\\nCigarette butts are the most littered item in the world, with 4.5 trillion discarded annually. The cellulose acetate butts are not biodegradable and, as a result, their chemical decomposition can take many decades.[1]
A Conjoined Wealth Fund (CWF) is a relatively small privately-owned investment fund or group of funds composed of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, property, precious metals or other financial instruments. Conjoined wealth funds invest funds globally to take advantage of the global growth and opportunities; however, they keep a strict domestic reinvestment mission in order to subsidize depleted governmental revenues. \\n\\nSome conjoined wealth funds are held solely by a non-profit or faith based organization, who accumulate the funds in the course of their management existing missions and donor initiatives of a small community; this type of fund is usually of major economic and fiscal importance to the region. Other conjoined wealth funds are simply the savings small for-profit businesses that depend heavily on a local community, invested by various entities for the purposes of investment return, and which may not have significant role in fiscal management.\\n\\nThe accumulated funds are used to prop up local communities too dense to receive the highest quality of goods and services a sovereign nation has to offer, as well as sparse communities that present obvious and long standing tax anomalies. While conjoined wealth funds engage the global equity markets, their core investment focus is assisting the state to create self sufficient communities and cities.
== '''scope of physics''' ==\\n\\nPhysics is closely related to the other natural sciences and, in a sense, encompasses them. Chemistry, for example, deals with the interaction of atoms to form molecules; much of modern geology is largely a study of the physics of the earth and is known as geophysics; and astronomy deals with the physics of the stars and outer space. Even living systems are made up of fundamental particles and, as studied in biophysics and biochemistry, they follow the same types of laws as the simpler particles traditionally studied by a physicist.\\n\\nThe emphasis on the interaction between particles in modern physics, known as the microscopic approach, must often be supplemented by a macroscopic approach that deals with larger elements or systems of particles. This macroscopic approach is indispensable to the application of physics to much of modern technology. Thermodynamics, for example, a branch of physics developed during the 19th century, deals with the elucidation and measurement of properties of a system as a whole and remains useful in other fields of physics; it also forms the basis of much of chemical and mechanical engineering. Such properties as the temperature, pressure, and volume of a gas have no meaning for an individual atom or molecule; these thermodynamic concepts can only be applied directly to a very large system of such particles. A bridge exists, however, between the microscopic and macroscopic approach; another branch of physics, known as statistical mechanics, indicates how pressure and temperature can be related to the motion of atoms and molecules on a statistical basis
Laser Safety \\n \\nDirect eye contact with the output beam from the laser will cause serious damage and possible blindness.\\nThe safe use of lasers requires that all laser users, and everyone near the laser system, are aware of the dangers involved. The safe use of the laser depends upon the user being familiar with the instrument and the characteristics of laser light.\\nIf the laser beam is reflected or scattered from various objects, it is very dangerous. Avoid physical contact with the laser beam. The high spectral intensity and short wavelength may cause tissue damage which is not immediately evident.\\n\\n \\nDo not permit any reflective object in the path of the beam. Scattering the beam from a reflective surface can be very damaging to the eyes or skin.\\n \\nBlock the beam when not in use.\\n \\nTurn the beam off, preventing stray reflections from occurring either between experiments or when moving the laser.\\n \\nIf possible, have an enclosed path for the laser beam.\\n \\nAlways point the laser at a specific target, such as a power meter.\\n \\nLimit access to the laser to qualified users who are familiar with laser safety practices and who are aware of the dangers involved.\\n \\nPost warning signs indicating the laser is being used.\\n \\nNever point the laser beam at anyone's' eyes.\\nCDRH (Center for Devices & Radiological Health)\\nA department of the United States Food and Drug Administration, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health establishes the safety regulations and requirements governing the manufacture of lasers and laser devices within the United States, along with many other responsibilities.
\\n                        \\n== '''THERMAL POLLUTION''' ==\\n\\n\\nThermal pollution is the degradation of water quality by any process that changes ambient water temperature. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. When water used as a coolant is returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature, the change in temperature impacts organisms by (a) decreasing oxygen supply, and (b) affecting ecosystem composition. Urban runoff--stormwater discharged to surface waters from roads and parking lots--can also be a source of elevated water temperatures.\\n\\nWhen a power plant first opens or shuts down for repair, fish and other organisms adapted to particular temperature range can be killed by the abrupt rise in water temperature known as 'thermal shock'.\\n\\nThermal pollution can also be caused by the release of very cold water from the base of reservoirs into warmer rivers. This affects fish (particularly their eggs and larvae), macroinvertebrates and river productivity.\\n\\nContents [hide]\\n1 Ecological effects — warm water \\n2 Ecological effects — cold water \\n3 Control of thermal pollution \\n4 See also \\n5 References \\n \\n\\n\\n[edit] Ecological effects — warm water\\nElevated temperature typically decreases the level of dissolved oxygen (DO) in water. The decrease in levels of DO can harm aquatic animals such as fish, amphibians and copepods. Thermal pollution may also increase the metabolic rate of aquatic animals, as enzyme activity, resulting in these organisms consuming more food in a shorter time than if their environment were not changed. An increased metabolic rate may result in food source shortages, causing a sharp decrease in a population. Changes in the environment may also result in a migration of organisms to another, more suitable environment, and to in-migration of fishes that normally only live in warmer waters elsewhere. This leads to competition for fewer resources; the more adapted organisms moving in may have an advantage over organisms that are not used to the warmer temperature. As a result one has the problem of compromising food chains of the old and new environments. Biodiversity can be decreased as a result.\\n\\n \\nFish killed in receiving watersIt is known that temperature changes of even one to two degrees Celsius can cause significant changes in organism metabolism and other adverse cellular biology effects. Principal adverse changes can include rendering cell walls less permeable to necessary osmosis, coagulation of cell proteins, and alteration of enzyme metabolism. These cellular level effects can adversely affect mortality and reproduction.\\n\\nPrimary producers are affected by warm water because higher water temperature increases plant growth rates, resulting in a shorter lifespan and species overpopulation. This can cause an algae bloom which reduces the oxygen levels in the water. The higher plant density leads to an increased plant respiration rate because the reduced light intensity decreases photosynthesis. This is similar to the eutrophication that occurs when watercourses are polluted with leached agricultural inorganic fertilizers.\\n\\nA large increase in temperature can lead to the denaturing of life-supporting enzymes by breaking down hydrogen- and disulphide bonds within the quaternary structure of the enzymes. Decreased enzyme activity in aquatic organisms can cause problems such as the inability to break down lipids, which leads to malnutrition.\\n\\nIn limited cases, warm water has little deleterious effect and may even lead to improved function of the receiving aquatic ecosystem. This phenomenon is seen especially in seasonal waters and is known as thermal enrichment. An extreme case is derived from the aggregational habits of the manatee, which often uses power plant discharge sites during winter. Projections suggest that manatee populations would decline upon the removal of these discharges.\\n\\nThe temperature can be as high as 70° Fahrenheit for freshwater, 80° F for saltwater, and 85° F for tropical fish.[clarification needed]\\n\\n\\n[edit] Ecological effects — cold water\\nReleases of unnaturally cold water from reservoirs can dramatically change the fish and macroinvertebrate fauna of rivers, and reduce river productivity. In Australia, where many rivers have warmer temperature regimes, native fish species have been eliminated, and macroinvertebrate fauna have been drastically altered and impoverished. The temperatures for freshwater fish can be as low as 50° F, saltwater 75° F, and tropical 80° F.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Control of thermal pollution\\n \\nCooling tower at Gustav Knepper Power Station, Dortmund, GermanyIndustrial wastewater\\nIn the United States, thermal pollution from industrial sources is generated mostly by power plants, petroleum refineries, pulp and paper mills, chemical plants, steel mills and smelters.[2] [3] Heated water from these sources may be controlled with:\\n\\ncooling ponds, man-made bodies of water designed for cooling by evaporation, convection, and radiation \\ncooling towers, which transfer waste heat to the atmosphere through evaporation and/or heat transfer \\ncogeneration, a process where waste heat is recycled for domestic and/or industrial heating purposes. \\nSome facilities use once-through cooling (OTC) systems which do not reduce temperature as effectively as the above systems. For example, the Potrero Generating Station in San Francisco, which uses OTC, discharges water to San Francisco Bay approximately 10° C (20° F) above the ambient bay temperature.[4]\\n\\n\\nUrban runoff\\nDuring warm weather, urban runoff can have significant thermal impacts on small streams, as stormwater passes over hot parking lots, roads and sidewalks. Stormwater management facilities that absorb runoff or direct it into groundwater, such as bioretention systems and infiltration basins, can reduce these thermal effects. Retention basins tend to be less effective at reducing temperature, as the water may be heated by the sun before being discharged to a receiving stream.[5]\\n\\n\\n[edit] See also\\nWater cooling \\nWater pollution \\nWater quality \\n\\n[edit] References\\n^ Selna, Robert (2009).

The temperature change can be upwards or downwards. \\nThe major sources of thermal pollution are power plants and industrial factories. In most power plants, heat is produced when coal, oil, or natural gas is burned or nuclear fuels undergo fission to release huge amounts of energy. \\nThis heat turns water to steam, which spins turbines to produce electricity. After cooling the used steam must be cooled and condensed back into water. To condense the steam, cool water is brought into the plant and circulated next to the hot steam. In this process, the water used for cooling increases 5 to 10 Celsius degrees.\\nIndustries such as metalworking use large amounts of water as coolant, and then release this water back into a nearby source, such as a lake or river. The released water then has a \\nhigher water temperature than the source of water, which then increases the temperature of that particular body of water. This affects the Aquatic organisms, as they are extremely sensitive to temperature change, in which when subject to this temperature change, like many other animals and plants pose the risk of dying of Thermal Shock.\\nIf these organisms die in that particular body of water, it poses a threat of disrupting/damaging the food chain, potentially leading to many other animals dying from starvation or in other instances overpopulation.

The World Institute of Sustainable Energy (WISE) is a not-for-profit institute set up in June 2004 to promote sustainable energy, energy conservation, and sustainable development. In particular, the institution is committed towards addressing the shortcomings existing in the sustainable energy sector in India, viz. lack of policy support and incentives, lack of legislative and research support, lack of qualified manpower, and lack of critical awareness that would lead to the transition to a sustainable energy-based economy. Since its inception, WISE has pioneered several initiatives for accelerating the development of sustainable energy in the country.
\\n\\nMusical Characteristics of Rap Hip-hop culture, once confined to the streets has broken into the commercial realm with force. Hip hop records top the charts week after week, rap videos have taken control of MTV, BET and the BOX, and there are dozens of hip hop magazines on the newsstands. A stroll on any city street in the United States reveals the proliferation of hip-hop styled apparel. The culture itself had much humbler beginnings, however. On the street corners and in the parks, young men and women battled through freestyle rhymes and dance moves. Whatever the time period, and whoever he MC may have been, Rap has incorporated, and included several of the “classical” musical characteristics present in most western music today. These characteristics have influenced the popularity of this genre from coast to coast; as well as, giving the music a chance to penetrate into the homes of a vast array of people (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc.). When one is referring to certain musical characteristics, pitch, dynamics, timbre, rhythm, melody, harmony, key, texture, form, and various others are usually mentioned. It is fascinating to see how many of these characteristics are present in the hip-hop culture, more specifical.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe loves to dance rap write songs and acting.com

B.G. Burkett, however, ignores the statistics of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Almost all legitimate sources state that a significant number of Vietnam combat veterans suffer from some degree of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Perhaps the most recent and most accurate of the study of these veterans, their pyschological disorders and consequences are described in Dr. Jonathans Shay's two highly accalimed books "Achilles in Vietnam" and "Odysseus in America." The treatment of Vietnam Veterans by both pro and anti-war groups, and the population in general, upon their return to America and the cultural milieu into which they re-entered caused a host of profound complex and often debilitating consequences for these veterans. Many of these veterans, almost forty years later, still carry the weight of these disorders and do not fully participate in the mainstream of American society. Rather they remain as "outliers" unable to comprehend why American society has rejected them.
\\n== World War III ==\\nThe nuclear war started in the Northern Hemisphere and lasted for thirty-nine days. Newspapers and radio stations had ceased operations during the war, so many people were left without knowledge of how or why everything started. Yet what was truly occurring was that Albania had initiated an Arab-Israeli war, which led to a Russia-NATO war, which led to a Russo-Chinese war. Atomic bombs fell all over the Northern Hemisphere.\\n== The Left-over Radiation ==\\n The radiation is spreading south steadily. The wind currents a slowly blowing the radiation to the Southern Hemisphere even though all the bombs were dropped in the Northern Hemisphere, thousands of miles away.There is simply nothing that can be done to stop the wind currents. The equatorial trade winds slow down the radiation but do not completely stop it from drifting. It is estimated that once the radiation has started spreading, it would take six months, give or take 3 months, for the radiation to fully take over the Southern Hemisphere as it has in the Northern Hemisphere. There seems to be no kind of life up north and those countries that already have  high radiation are infected so there is nothing that could be done to save them.\\n[[File:301905 281406401890345 508002931 n large]]

It is true that during that\\ntime period the most powerful countries in Europe tended not to fight with\\neach other. This tranquility contrasted strongly with the era of the French\\nRevolution and Napoleon (1789–1815), when large numbers of Europeans\\nfought and died for the sake of their nations and empires. By comparison, the\\nperiod from 1815 to 1914 does seem relatively tranquil. The relative absence\\nof warfare between nations allowed for a major burst in industrialization and\\ntechnological development, which resulted in disruptions, to be sure, even\\nas the overall standard of living rose in most places.\\nYet this era cannot honestly be described as an era of complete tranquility.\\nIn the middle of the century, major conflicts were associated with the\\nunification of the German and Italian nations. In response to the forces of\\nnationalism, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire fought\\nto stave off disintegration. Meanwhile, Britain and France—and to a lesser\\ndegree Germany, Italy, Japan, Portugal, and the United States—expanded\\ntheir empires overseas. For the most part, their colonies were obtained by\\nshedding the blood of the native inhabitants and, to a lesser extent, the\\nblood of their own soldiers.\\nThe building of nations, empires, and industries was the main feature of\\nEuropean, Japanese, and U.S. history in the period from 1850 to 1914.

Project R&R: Release and Restitution for Chimpanzees is NEAVS’ national campaign to end the use of chimpanzees in invasive biomedical research and provide them permanent release and restitution in sanctuary. The historic work of Project R&R will lead to the first non-human species being afforded legal protection from use in harmful research. \\n\\nThe U.S. is the only remaining country to hold large numbers of chimpanzees in laboratories.  Even in the U.S., their use in active protocols has steadily declined due to ethical concerns, the enormous expense of using and housing them in laboratories, and the scientific limitations and failures of the chimpanzee as a model for humans. Yet U.S. labs confine some 1,065 chimpanzees.
Saving the valuable resources of earth.....\\n\\nTime v/s effective utilization of Natural resources\\n\\nWith the growing generation gap & 'time is money' attitude, no one thinks how important natural resources are. Our lives have become so luxurious that we rarely think about saving the precious resources of earth...We do not realise that the luxuries (commodities that save human energy & time) we get are sometimes (actually most of the times) are at the cost of destroying our natural resources & we take them for granted either knowingly or unknowingly. In fact these luxuries make man forget how to use/ save natural resources effectively. However there have been significant efforts in creating awareness through various mediums and forums. \\n \\nFor instance: This years noble peace prize is awarded jointly to the UN sponsored Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change ( IPCC ) and Albert Arnold Gore Jr, the ex-vice president of USA for their effort to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundation for the measures that are needed to counteract such changes. This very recognition brings home the point that such issues have assumed very serious proportions now and every stake holder has to take notice of the same and do the needful at their end.\\n\\nSo, what are we all waiting for....Go Green!!  Save earth. \\n\\nYour small effort to save natural resources can make a huge difference to the world...
'''Transnational Governance'''\\n\\nThe concept of transnational governance is seen by many as a rather new category of governance. But it’s not because few or no literature are available on a precise topics that this topics didn’t exist. \\n\\nThe amount of literature around governance become more and more big but nothing is still available on transnational governance.\\n\\nReach good transnational governance could lead to real economic, social  improvements as well as alleviating poverty,  eliminating illiteracy or reducing infant and maternal mortality in deprived area. These transnational improvements could be much easier to reach if the countries involved in this kind of multi-national area share a common identity.\\n\\nThus, the idea of common identity could have a central place in the definition of transnational governance.
 \\nMousa Bani Baker \\nA PhD candidate in the faculty of Engineering and Computer Science- Concordia University-Montreal, specializing in Geo-environmental engineering. My research is focused on protecting the environment and more specifically on designing a new liner material to protect the ground water table from toxic materials. It amazed me to learn that fresh water represents only 3.5% of the Earth’s total water. Of that 3.5%, two-thirds is ground water. Protecting this resource from toxic chemicals is incredibly important and is why I am committed to pursuing research in this area. Since my childhood I have been involved with environmental activism, beginning with volunteering for clubs and moving on to research and professional work as I got older. I am a strong believer that we have the responsibility to teach our children and raise their awareness about environmental issues. During my spare time I enjoy teaching children English as a second language, mathematics and physics.
Jet aircraft of the type from which this data was collected typically fly at altitudes greater than 10,000 m; well above the vertical limit of human survivability. Pressure and temperature outside the cabin on this flight are about 26 kPa (one-quarter atmosphere) and -60 °C, respectively. That's low enough that most humans would suffocate in under thirty seconds and freeze solid in a few hours.\\n\\nAlthough the environmental conditions outside are harsh, life inside a jet isn't all that bad. While passengers would find it most comfortable if the cabin was kept at one atmosphere there are engineering and economic reasons to maintain the pressure at a lower value. During this flight the cabin pressure was kept at a compromise value of 81 kPa -- much higher than the pressure outside, but still lower than what most people live under. (80 kPa is the average atmospheric pressure at an elevation of 2000 m.) Temperature hardly varied at all, staying nearly constant at 23 °C. (People are far more sensitive to temperature changes than to pressure changes.)\\n\\nWhen air is drawn into the cabin from outside, to what temperature does it rise after it has been compressed?\\n\\n\\n\\nif someone could help me with an answer and explanation for that please.
The purpose of this policy, known as the “Canary Initiative” is to drastically reduce Aspen’s carbon footprint. Because of Aspen’s high-end reputation, the carbon level this city emits is significantly higher than a similar-sized city. The initiative received its name from the idea that Aspen’s climate is a “canary in a coal mine”; that is, Aspen's climate could be significantly altered by events and changes from outside areas. Aspen is a popular resort destination for its ski mountains, and tourism is a key component in the business Aspen receives. However, with rising global temperatures, Aspen’s snow is estimated to disappear entirely by 2100. In order to prevent irreversible damage to the natural environment, while sustaining and developing Aspen's economy, this city-wide initiative was created. The initiative calls for: a greenhouse gas emissions inventory, an assessment of impacts of global and local climate change, an education and action plan for advocacy on regional, state, and national levels. \\n\\n'''Aspen’s 2000 IPCC Report'''\\n\\nIn 2000, the city of Aspen and the Aspen Skiing Company launched a study of the effects of rising temperatures on Aspen and the surrounding mountains. Using state-of the art climate prediction models, as well as unique physical and geographical data for Aspen, the report illustrated the consequences of various actions of humankind. The following data is from the results of the study. In the low emissions scenario (global greenhouse gas levels peak at or around 500 ppm), Aspen was expected to experience about 6 degrees F of warming by 2100, giving Aspen a climate more similar to Los Alamos, New Mexico. Under the “business as usual” scenario, GHG levels would peak around 700 ppm, and Aspen would experience 14 degrees F of warming by 2100, giving it a climate more like Amarillo, Texas. In both of these scenarios, Aspen’s snowpack is dramatically reduced; in the “business-as-usual” scenario the snowpack is virtually non-existent by 2100. Because of the alarming results of the IPCC report, Aspen and the Aspen Skiing Company quickly mobilized to clean up—their business depends on it. Several adverse effects on the spring runoff and ecosystems of Aspen were also mentioned, most notably the peak spring discharge occurring earlier in the year, and an increase of summer droughts. \\n\\n'''Greenhouse Gas Reductions'''\\n\\nIn 2005, the City of Aspen made and signed a legally-binding contract to reduce its GHG emissions by at least 1% every year. By the end of 2006 Aspen had reduced its emissions by 11.5%, and new, more stringent community reduction goals were made. The Canary Initiative requires GHG emissions to be cut by 30% (from 2004 levels) by 2020, and 80% reduction by mid-century.\\n\\n'''Canary Action Plan'''\\n\\nThe Canary Action Plan details the emission cuts or general improvements that need to be made in several sectors of business. Sectors include: policy, research, and education; energy efficient buildings; ground and air transportation, electricity (higher percentage of renewable), landfill waste reduction/recycling programs, and finally carbon credits to offset extra GHG produced.\\n\\n''Policy, Research, and Education:''\\n•	Ensure that education and policy decisions at all levels – government, business, and individual – seek to significantly reduce GHG emissions\\n•	Provide education, in a variety of venues, and data needed by the community to understand the need for action to reduce global warming\\n\\n''Buildings: Energy Efficiency:''\\n•	Reduce GHG’s 20% below 2004 levels in all City of Aspen facilities by 2009\\n•	Require all new construction (commercial and residential) to be 50% more energy efficient than the International Energy Conservation Code by 2009.\\n•	Encourage and incentivize existing buildings (commercial and residential) to reduce GHG emissions 20% below 2004 levels by 2009\\n\\n''Air and Ground Transportation''\\n•	Reduce the volume of single occupancy traffic into Aspen and around town.\\n•	Create a mass transit-oriented transportation alternative into Aspen that is more convenient and affordable and has lower GHG emissions per passenger mile than the average private vehicle.\\n•	Increase the use of highly fuel-efficient and low emissions fuel engines and machinery in on-road and off-road vehicles.\\n•	Require that all new development projects have a net decrease in transportation related emissions compared to existing development conditions\\n•	Reduce emissions from air travel\\n\\n''Electricity:'' Generate and/or purchase 45% of Aspen’s electricity from renewable resources by 2012.\\n\\n''Landfill:'' Waste Reduction and Recycling\\n•	Increase the overall solid waste recycling rate by 20% over the 2006 baseline by 2009.\\n•	Decrease the amount of solid waste generated\\n\\n''Localization'': Carbon Offsets, Food, and Other\\n•	Provide a reliable and effective option to offset GHG emissions\\n•	Educate City staff and the community on the global warming impacts of the industrialized food supply chain and encourage the cultivation and purchase of locally produced foods\\n\\n<reference>http://aspenpitkin.com/Living-in-the-Valley/Green-Initiatives/Canary-Initiative/\\n<reference/>

'''    The uniqueness of Ayurveda, science of life, lies in its positive approach to life. Life is for living fully, fulfilling one, for which both sound health and a normal life span are indispensable. Ill health and a short span of life are negation to life. Ayurveda therefore insists on an understanding, by man of his relationship with nature and society he lives in, and of his living in harmony with both. Ayurveda works not only as a simple health care system, but a lifestyle able to maintain the body in perfect harmony with nature. It gives prime importance to individuals as a whole in his physical, mental and spiritual levels considering his condition, temperament, environment and even habits to design the healing process as well as enabling him for a healthy living. The promotive, preventive, corrective and curative aspects of healthcare and the medicines possessing such properties are indeed the strength of Ayurveda.\\n\\n   Heart disease has earned the reputation of being a merciless killer, which robs the human life in its prime. Its blow either proves fatal or causes considerable disability. It is one of the most serious maladies, not only in western countries, but also in the east. The incidence of this dreaded disease is rising and in recent years it has become the greatest menace to mankind.\\n\\n   Although extensive work has been done in modern medicine in the diagnosis and management of Heart diseases, efforts on the prevention of the disease in the population is still unsatisfactory. This is an area in which there is a definite scope for Ayurveda, by the modification of risk factors aiming at prevention of heart diseases.

The implications of an increase in marine litter are far reaching - affecting both human health and the ecosystem. Although this is a global issue it is time for Europe to show leadership in solving this problem. \\n\\n\\n'''Willingness to provide solutions'''\\n\\nThe Waste Free Oceans Foundation has initiated this marine litter project in order to provide a solution to the problem of floating marine debris. Boats outfitted with a special trawl will be able to collect between 2-8 tones of waste (per trawl) for cleaning & recycling.Using the knowledge of fishermen and homegrown technology, the project aims to educate all stakeholders in tackling debris on Europe’s coastlines and waters by 2020.\\n\\n<ref>www.wastefreeoceans.eu</ref>
Environmental issues in India are many. Air pollution, water pollution, garbage pollution and wildlife natural habitat pollution challenge India. The situation was worse between 1947 through 1995. According to data collection and environment assessment studies of World Bank experts, between 1995 through 2010, India has made one of the fastest progress in the world, in addressing its environmental issues and improving its environmental quality.[1][2] Still, India has a long way to go to reach environmental quality similar to those enjoyed in developed economies. Pollution remains a major challenge and opportunity for India.\\n\\nSome believe economic development is leading to environmental issues in India. Others believe economic development is key to improving India's environmental management and preventing pollution in India.\\n\\nSome suggest India's growing population is the primary cause of India's environmental degradation. Systematic studies challenge this theory. Empirical evidence from countries such as Japan, England and Singapore, each with population density similar or higher than India, yet each enjoying environmental quality vastly superior than India, suggests population density may not be the only factor affecting India's issues.[3]\\n\\nMajor environmental issues are forest and agricultural degradation of land, resource depletion (water, mineral, forest, sand, rocks etc.), environmental degradation, public health, loss of biodiversity, loss of resilience in ecosystems, livelihood security for the poor.[4]\\n\\nThe major sources of pollution in India include the rampant burning of fuelwood and biomass such as dried waste from livestock as the primary source of energy,[5] lack of organized garbage and waste removal services, lack of sewage treatment operations, lack of flood control and monsoon water drainage system, diversion of consumer waste into rivers, cremation practices near major rivers, government mandated protection of highly polluting old public transport, and continued operation by Indian government of government owned, high emission plants built between 1950 to 1980.[6][7][8][9][10]\\n\\nIndia's water supply and sanitation issues are related to many environmental issues.\\n\\nEnvironmental issues are one of the primary causes of disease, health issues and long term livelihood impact for India.\\nContents\\n [hide] \\n\\n    * 1 History\\n    * 2 Major issues\\n          o 2.1 Population growth and environmental quality\\n    * 3 Pollution\\n          o 3.1 Water pollution\\n          o 3.2 Recent efforts to address water issues\\n          o 3.3 Air pollution\\n          o 3.4 Solid waste pollution\\n          o 3.5 Noise pollution\\n          o 3.6 Land pollution\\n    * 4 Environmental issues and Indian law\\n    * 5 Conservation\\n    * 6 See also\\n    * 7 References\\n    * 8 Further reading\\n    * 9 External links\\n\\n[edit] History\\nAshoka Pillar Edicts were one of earliest efforts in India focussed on respecting and preserving environment, forests and wildlife.\\n\\nYajnavalkya Smriti, a historic Indian text on statecraft and jurisprudence, suggested to have been written before 5th century AD, prohibited the cutting of trees and prescribed punishment for such acts. Kautalya's Arthashastra, written in India's Mauryan period, emphasized the need for forest administration. Ashoka went further, and his Pillar Edicts expressed his view about the welfare of environment and biodiversity.\\n\\n    "Happiness in this world and the next is difficult to obtain without much love for the dhamma, much self-examination, much respect, much fear of evil, and much enthusiasm. [...] Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi (Ashoka), speaks thus: Animals were declared to be protected – parrots, mainas, aruna, geese, wild ducks, nandimukhas, gelatas, bats, queen ants, terrapins, boneless fish, vedareyaka, gangapuputaka, sankiya fish, tortoises, porcupines, squirrels, deer, bulls, okapinda, wild asses, wild pigeons, domestic pigeons and all four-footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible. Also protected were nanny goats, ewes and sows which are with young or giving milk to their young, and so are young ones less than six months old. Cocks are not to be caponized, husks hiding living beings are not to be burnt, and forests are not to be burnt either without reason or to kill creatures. One animal is not to be fed to another. Our king killed very few animals."\\n\\n    — Ashoka's Seven Pillar Edicts[11]\\n\\nBritish rule of India saw several laws related to environment. Amongst the earliest ones were Shore Nuisance (Bombay and Kolaba) Act of 1853 and the Oriental Gas Company Act of 1857. The Indian Penal Code of 1860, imposed a fine on anyone who voluntarily fouls the water of any public spring or reservoir. In addition, the Code penalised negligent acts. British India also enacted laws aimed at controlling air pollution. Prominent amongst these were the Bengal Smoke Nuisance Act of 1905 and the Bombay Smoke Nuisance Act of 1912. While these laws failed in having the intended effect, British-enacted legislations pioneered the growth of environmental regulations in India.\\n\\nUpon independence from Britain, India adopted a constitution and numerous British-enacted laws, without any specific constitutional provision on protecting environment. India amended its constitution in 1976. Article 48(A) of Part IV of the amended constitution, read: The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country. Article 51 A(g) imposed additional environmental mandates on the Indian state.\\n\\nOther Indian laws from recent history include the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1974, the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981. The Air Act was inspired by the decisions made at Stockholm Conference. The Bhopal gas tragedy triggered the Government of India to enact the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986. India has also enacted a set of Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules in 2000.\\n\\nIn 1985, Indian government created the Ministry of Environment and Forests. This ministry is the central administrative organisation in India for regulating and ensuring environmental protection.\\n\\nDespite active passage of laws by the central government of India, the reality of environmental quality mostly worsened between 1947 to 1990. Most of Indian economy was nationalized and owned by India, and regulations were mostly ignored by state run enterprises. Rural poor had no choice, but to sustain life in whatever way possible. The state governments of India often regarded environmental laws enacted by the central government as a mere paperwork formality. Air emissions increased, water pollution worsened, forest cover decreased.\\n\\nStarting in 1990s, reforms were introduced. Since then, for the first time in Indian history, major air pollutant concentrations have dropped in every 5 year period. Between 1992 to 2010, satellite data confirms India's forest coverage has increased for the first time by over 4 million hectares, a 7% increase.[12]\\n[edit] Major issues\\nFloods are a significant environmental issue for India. It causes soil erosion, destruction of wetlands and wide migration of solid wastes.\\n\\nAir pollution, poor management of waste, growing water scarcity, falling groundwater tables, water pollution, preservation and quality of forests, biodiversity loss, and land/soil degradation are some of the major environmental issues India faces today.[13]\\n\\nIndia's population growth adds pressure to environmental issues and its resources.\\n\\nEnvironmental issues in India include various natural hazards, particularly cyclones and annual monsoon floods. An estimated 60% of cultivated land suffers from soil erosion, waterlogging, and salinity. It is also estimated that between 4.7 and 12 billion tons of topsoil are lost annually from soil erosion.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe Indian Agricultural Research Institute of Parvati has estimated that a 3 °C rise in temperature will result in a 15 to 20% loss in annual wheat yields.[citation needed] These are substantial problems for a nation with such a large population depending on the productivity of primary resources and whose economic growth relies heavily on industrial growth. Civil conflicts involving natural resources—most notably forests and arable land—have occurred in eastern and northeastern states.\\n[edit] Population growth and environmental quality\\n\\nThere is a long history of study and debate about the interactions between population growth and the environment. According to the British thinker Malthus, for example, a growing population exerts pressure on agricultural land, causing environmental degradation, and forcing the cultivation of land of poorer and poorer quality. This environmental degradation ultimately reduces agricultural yields and food availability, causes famines and diseases and death, thereby reducing the rate of population growth. Population growth, because it can place increased pressure on the assimilative capacity of the environment, is also seen as a major cause of air, water, and solid-waste pollution. The result, Malthus theorized, is an equilibrium population that enjoys low levels of both income and environmental quality. Malthus suggested positive and preventative forced control of human population, along with abolition of poor laws.\\n\\nMalthus theory, published between 1798 and 1826, has been analyzed and criticized ever since. The American thinker Henry George, for example, observed with his characteristic piquancy in dismissing Malthus: "Both the jayhawk and the man eat chickens; but the more jayhawks, the fewer chickens, while the more men, the more chickens." Similarly, the American economist Julian Lincoln Simon criticised Malthus's theory.[14] He noted that the facts of human history have proven the predictions of Malthus and of the Neo-Malthusians to be flawed. Massive geometric population growth in the 20th century did not result in a Malthusian catastrophe. The possible reasons include: increase in human knowledge, rapid increases in productivity, innovation and application of knowledge, general improvements in farming methods (industrial agriculture), mechanization of work (tractors), the introduction of high-yield varieties of wheat and other plants (Green Revolution), the use of pesticides to control crop pests.[15]\\n\\nMore recent scholarly articles concede that while there is no question that population growth may contribute to environmental degradation, its effects can be modified by economic growth and modern technology.[16] Research in environmental economics has uncovered a relationship between environmental quality, measured by ambient concentrations of air pollutants and per capita income. This so-called environmental Kuznets curve shows environmental quality worsening up until about $5,000 of per capita income on purchasing parity basis, and improving thereafter.[17] The key requirement, for this to be true, is continued adoption of technology and scientific management of resources, continued increases in productivity in every economic sector, entrepreneurial innovation and economic expansion.\\n\\nOther data suggests that population density has little correlation to environmental quality and human quality of life. India's population density, in 2011, was about 368 human beings per square kilometer. Many countries with population density similar or higher than India enjoy environmental quality as well as human quality of life far superior than India. For example: Singapore (7148 /km2), Hong Kong-China (6349 /km2), South Korea (487 /km2), Netherlands (403 /km2), Belgium (355 / km2), Japan (337/ km2), England (395 /km2), the state of Florida (353 / km2), the state of New York (412 / km2), the state of Massachusetts (840 / km2), the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (523 / km2), the region of Île-de-France (974 / km2), and the region of Lombardy (417 / km2).\\n[edit] Pollution\\n[edit] Water pollution\\nSee also: Water supply and sanitation in India\\nHanskhali drainage canal, it passes contaminated water direct to the Ganges at Howrah, West Bengal. Sewage and drainage canals like this are the dominant cause of water pollution in India.\\n\\nA 2007 study finds that discharge of untreated sewage is single most important cause for pollution of surface and ground water in India. There is a large gap between generation and treatment of domestic wastewater in India. The problem is not only that India lacks sufficient treatment capacity but also that the sewage treatment plants that exist do not operate and are not maintained. Majority of the government-owned sewage treatment plants remain closed most of the time due to improper design or poor maintenance or lack of reliable electricity supply to operate the plants, together with absentee employees and poor management. The wastewater generated in these areas normally percolates in the soil or evaporates. The uncollected wastes accumulate in the urban areas cause unhygienic conditions and release pollutants that leaches to surface and groundwater.[18]\\n\\nA 1992 World Health Organization study is claimed to have reported that out of India's 3,119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial sewage treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities.[19] Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. A 1995 report claimed 114 Indian cities were dumping untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River.[20] Open defecation is widespread even in urban areas of India.[21][22] This situation is typical of India as well as other developing countries.\\n\\nAccording to another 2005 report, sewage discharged from cities and towns is the predominant cause of water pollution in India. Investment is needed to bridge the gap between 29000 million litre per day of sewage India generates, and a treatment capacity of mere 6000 million litre per day.[23] A large number of Indian rivers are severely polluted as a result of discharge of domestic sewage.\\n\\nThe Central Pollution Control Board, a Ministry of Environment & Forests Government of India entity, has established a National Water Quality Monitoring Network comprising 1429 monitoring stations in 27 states and 6 in Union Territories on various rivers and water bodies across the country. This effort monitors water quality year round. The monitoring network covers 293 rivers, 94 lakes, 9 tanks, 41 ponds, 8 creeks, 23 canals, 18 drains and 411 wells distributed across India.[24] Water samples are routinely analyzed for 28 parameters including dissolved oxygen, bacteriological and other internationally established parameters for water quality. Additionally 9 trace metals parameters and 28 pesticide residues are analyzed. Biomonitoring is also carried out on specific locations.\\n\\nThe scientific analysis of water samples from 1995 to 2008 indicates that the organic and bacterial contamination are severe in water bodies of India. This is mainly due to discharge of domestic wastewater in untreated form, mostly from the urban centers of India.\\n\\nIn 2008, the water quality monitoring found almost all rivers with high levels of BOD. The worst pollution, in decreasing order, were found in river Markanda (590 mg O/l), followed by river Kali (364), river Amlakhadi (353), Yamuna canal (247), river Yamuna at Delhi (70) and river Betwa (58). For context, a water sample with a 5 day BOD between 1 and 2 mg O/L indicates a very clean water, 3 to 8 mg O/L indicates a moderately clean water, 8 to 20 indicates borderline water, and greater than 20 mg O/L indicates ecologically-unsafe polluted water.\\n\\nThe Mithi River, which flows through the city of Mumbai, is heavily polluted.\\n\\nThe levels of BOD are severe near the cities and major towns. In rural parts of India, the river BOD levels were sufficient to support aquatic life.\\n\\nTotal coliform and fecal coliform densities in the rivers of India range between 500 to 100,000 MPN/100 ml.[24] The presence of coliform suggests that the water is being contaminated with the fecal material of humans, livestocks, pets and other animals. Rivers Yamuna, Ganga, Gomti, Ghaggar, Chambal, Mahi, Vardha are amongst the other most coliform polluted water bodies in India. For context, coliform must be below 104 MPN/100 ml,[25] preferably absent from water for it to be considered safe for general human use, and for irrigation where coliform may cause disease outbreak from contaminated-water in agriculture.[26][27]\\n\\nIn 2006, 47 percent of water quality monitoring stations in India reported a total average annual coliform levels above 500 MPN/100 ml. During 2008, 33 percent of all water quality monitoring stations reported a total coliform levels exceeding those levels, suggesting recent effort to add pollution control infrastructure and upgrade treatment plants in India, may be reversing the water pollution trend.\\n\\nTreatment of domestic sewage and subsequent utilization of treated sewage for irrigation can prevent pollution of water bodies, reduce the demand for fresh water in irrigation sector and become a resource for irrigation. Since 2005, Indian wastewater treatment plant market has been growing annually at the rate of 10 to 12 percent. The United States is the largest supplier of treatment equipment and supplies to India, with 40 percent market share of new installation.[28] At this rate of expansion, and assuming the government of India continues on its path of reform, major investments in sewage treatment plants and electricity infrastructure development, India will nearly triple its water treatment capacity by 2015, and treatment capacity supply will match India's daily sewage water treatment requirements by about 2020.\\n\\nWater resources have not been linked to either domestic or international violent conflict as was previously anticipated by some observers. Possible exceptions, notes a 2004 report, include some communal violence related to distribution of water from the Kaveri River and political tensions surrounding actual and potential population displacements by dam projects, particularly on the Narmada River.[29] A 1997 article claimed Punjab is another hotbed of pollution, for example, Buddha Nullah, a rivulet which run through Malwa region of Punjab, India, and after passing through highly populated Ludhiana district, before draining into Sutlej River, a tributary of the Indus river, is today an important case point in the recent studies, which suggest this as another Bhopal in making.[30]\\n\\nA joint study by PGIMER and Punjab Pollution Control Board in 2008, revealed that in villages along the Nullah, calcium, magnesium, fluoride, mercury, beta-endosulphan and heptachlor pesticide were more than permissible limit (MPL) in ground and tap waters. Plus the water had high concentration of COD and BOD (chemical and biochemical oxygen demand), ammonia, phosphate, chloride, chromium, arsenic and chlorpyrifos pesticide. The ground water also contains nickel and selenium, while the tap water has high concentration of lead, nickel and cadmium.[31] The Hindon River, which flows through the city of Ghaziabad, highly polluted and groundwater of this city has colored and poisoned by industrial effluents, Hindon Vahini is strongly opposing of water pollution activities.\\n\\nFlooding during monsoons worsens India's water pollution problem, as it washes and moves all sorts of solid garbage and contaminated soils into its rivers and wetlands.\\n\\nThe annual average precipitation in India is about 4000 billion cubic metres.[23] From this, with the state of Indian infrastructure in 2005, the available water resource through the rivers is about 1869 billion cubic meters. Accounting to uneven distribution of rain over the country each year, water resources available for utilization, including ground water, is claimed to be about 1122 billion cubic meters. Much of this water is unsafe, because pollution degrades water quality. Water pollution severely limits the amount of water available to Indian consumer, its industry and its agriculture.\\n\\nThe Ganges\\n\\nMillions depend on the polluted Ganges river.\\nMain article: Pollution of the Ganges\\n\\n    To know why 1,000 Indian children die of diarrhoeal sickness every day, take a wary stroll along the Ganges in Varanasi. As it enters the city, Hinduism’s sacred river contains 60,000 faecal coliform bacteria per 100 millilitres, 120 times more than is considered safe for bathing. Four miles downstream, with inputs from 24 gushing sewers and 60,000 pilgrim-bathers, the concentration is 3,000 times over the safety limit. In places, the Ganges becomes black and septic. Corpses, of semi-cremated adults or enshrouded babies, drift slowly by.\\n\\n    — The Economist on December 11, 2008[32]\\n\\nMore than 400 million people live along the Ganges River. An estimated 2,000,000 persons ritually bathe daily[citation needed] in the river, which is considered holy by Hindus. In the Hindu religion it is said to flow from the lotus feet of Vishnu (for Vaisnava devotees) or the hair of Shiva (for Saivites). The spiritual and religious significance could be compared to what the Nile river meant to the ancient Egyptians. While the Ganges may be considered holy, there are some problems associated with the ecology. It is filled with chemical wastes[citation needed], sewage and even the remains of human and animal corpses which carry major health risks by either direct bathing in the water, or by drinking (the Fecal-oral route).\\n\\nThe Yamuna\\n\\nThe Taj Mahal next to the polluted Yamuna river.\\nMain article: Yamuna\\n\\nNewsWeek describes Delhi's sacred Yamuna River as "a putrid ribbon of black sludge" where fecal bacteria is 10,000 over safety limits despite a 15-year program to address the problem.[33] Cholera epidemics are not unknown.[33] NewsWeek observes India's messy democracy is particularly ill equipped to handle the conflicting pressures of rapid growth and poverty. Even though India revised its national water policy in 2002 to encourage community participation and decentralize water management, the country's Byzantine bureaucracy ensures that it remains a "mere statement of intent." Responsibility for managing water issues is fragmented among a dozen different ministries and departments without any coordination. The government bureaucracy and state-run project department has failed to solve the problem, despite having spent many years and $500 million on this project.\\n[edit] Recent efforts to address water issues\\n\\nThe government of India envisions a US$100 billion project to interlink all major river networks in India.[34] This initiative would connect water-deficient areas to water-abundant ones by interlinking 37 Indian rivers.[35] One of the largest projects anywhere in the world, it would transfer water through 30 links across 9,600 kilometers. It would connect 32 dams and use 56 million tons of cement and 2 million tons of steel. The project aims a transformation of India's water treatment, management, transmission and distribution. The Indian government has proposed reforms to attract investment and privatization of its water networks. Water companies from all over the world have established a presence in India to pursue an estimated 70 projects worth several billion dollars in 20 Indian cities.[28] India is debating the social and environmental impact of this project. One of the first projects under consideration is the linking of Ken and Betwa rivers in northern India.\\n[edit] Air pollution\\nCooking fuel in rural India is prepared from a wet mix of dried grass, fuelwood pieces, hay, leaves and mostly cow/livestock dung. This mix is patted down into disc-shaped cakes, dried, and then used as fuel in stoves. When it burns, it produces smoke and numerous indoor air pollutants at concentrations 5 times higher than coal.\\nA rural stove using biomass cakes, fuelwood and trash as cooking fuel. Surveys suggest over 100 million households in India use such stoves (chullahs) every day, 2-3 times a day. Clean burning fuels and electricity are unavailable in rural parts and small towns of India because of poor rural highways and limited energy generation infrastructure.\\nAir pollution is high in Indian cities.\\nTraffic congestion on inadequate road infrastructure is a daily reality of India's urban centers. Slow speeds and idling vehicles produce, per trip, 4 to 8 times more pollutants and consume more carbon footprint fuels, than free flowing traffic. This 2008 image shows traffic congestion in Delhi.\\nSee also: Global warming in India\\n\\nFuel wood and biomass burning\\n\\nFuelwood and biomass burning is the primary reason for near-permanent haze and smoke observed above rural and urban India, and in satellite pictures of the country. Fuelwood and biomass cakes are used for cooking and general heating needs. These are burnt in cook stoves known as chullah or chulha in some parts of India. These cook stoves are present in over 100 million Indian households, and are used two to three times a day, daily. As of 2009, majority of Indians still use traditional fuels such as dried cow dung, agricultural wastes, and firewood as cooking fuel.[36] This form of fuel is inefficient source of energy, its burning releases high levels of smoke, PM10 particulate matter, NOX, SOX, PAHs, polyaromatics, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and other air pollutants.[5][37][38][39] Some reports, including one by the World Health Organization, claim 300,000 to 400,000 people die of indoor air pollution and carbon monoxide poisoning in India because of biomass burning and use of chullahs.[40] Burning of biomass and firewood will not stop, unless electricity or clean burning fuel and combustion technologies become reliably available and widely adopted in rural and urban India.\\n\\nIndia is the world's largest consumer of fuelwood, agricultural waste and biomass for energy purposes. From the most recent available nationwide study, India used 148.7 million tonnes coal replacement worth of fuelwood and biomass annually for domestic energy use. India's national average annual per capita consumption of fuel wood, agri wate and biomass cakes was 206 kilogram coal equivalent. In 2010 terms, with India's population increased to about 1.2 billion, the country burns over 200 million tonnes of coal replacement worth of fuel wood and biomass every year to meet its energy need for cooking and other domestic use. The study found that the households consumed around 95 million tonnes of fuelwood, one-third of which was logs and the rest was twigs. Twigs were mostly consumed in the villages, and logs were more popular in cities of India. The overall contribution of fuelwood, including sawdust and wood waste, was about 46% of the total, the rest being agri waste and biomass dung cakes. Traditional fuel (fuelwood, crop residue and dung cake) dominates domestic energy use in rural India and accounts for about 90% of the total. In urban areas, this traditional fuel constitutes about 24% of the total.[41]\\n\\nFuel wood, agri waste and biomass cake burning releases over 165 million tonnes of combustion products into India's indoor and outdoor air every year. To place this volume of emission in context, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the United States estimates that fire wood smoke contributes over 420,000 tonnes of fine particles throughout the United States – mostly during the winter months. United States consumes about one-tenth of fuelwood consumed by India, and mostly for fire place and home heating purposes. EPA estimates that residential wood combustion in the USA accounts for 44 percent of total organic matter emissions and 62 percent of the PAH, which are probable human carcinogens and are of great concern to EPA. The fuelwood sourced residential wood smoke makes up over 50 percent of the wintertime particle pollution problem in California.[42] In 2010, the state of California had about the same number of vehicles as all of India.\\n\\nIndia burns tenfold more fuelwood every year than the United States, the fuelwood quality in India is different than the dry firewood of the United States, and the Indian stoves in use are less efficient thereby producing more smoke and air pollutants per kilogram equivalent. India has less land area and less emission air space than the United States. In summary, the impact on indoor and outdoor air pollution by fuelwood and biomass cake burning is far worse in India.\\n\\nA United Nations study[43] finds firewood and biomass stoves can be made more efficient in India. Animal dung, now used in inefficient stoves, could be used to produce biogas, a cleaner fuel with higher utilization efficiency. In addition, an excellent fertilizer can be produced from the slurry from biogas plants. Switching to gaseous fuels would bring the greatest gains in terms of both thermal efficiency and reduction in air pollution, but would require more investment. A combination of technologies may be the best way forward.\\n\\nBetween 2001 and 2010, India has made progress in adding electrical power generation capacity, bringing electricity to rural areas, and reforming market to improve availability and distribution of liquified cleaner burning fuels in urban and rural area. Over the same period, scientific data collection and analysis show improvement in India's air quality, with some regions witnessing 30 to 65% reduction in NOx, SOx and suspended particulate matter. Even at these lower levels, the emissions are higher than those recommended by the World Health Organization. Continued progress is necessary.\\n\\nScientific studies conclude biomass combustion in India is the country's dominant source of carbonaceous aerosols, emitting 0.25 teragram per year of black carbon into air, 0.94 teragram per year of organic matter, and 2.04 teragram per year of small particulates with diameter less than 2.5 microns. Biomass burning, as domestic fuel in India, accounts for about 3 times as much black carbon air pollution as all other sources combined, including vehicles and industrial sources.[44]\\n\\nOther sources of pollution in Indian cities are vehicles and emissions from industry. Until 1992, India protected its automobile industry using license raj. Many two wheel, three wheel and four wheel vehicles lacked catalytic converters. Per vehicle emissions were amongst the highest in the world. The refining of oil and supply of fuel was owned, regulated and run by the government; the fuel quality was lax.\\n\\nIn 2005, India adopted emission standard of Bharat Stage IV for vehicles, which is equivalent to Euro IV European standards for vehicle emissions. Nevertheless, the old pre-2005 vehicles, and even pre-1992 vehicles are still on Indian streets.\\n\\nFuel adulteration\\n\\nSome Indian taxis and auto-rickshaws run on adulterated fuel blends. Adulteration of gasoline and diesel with lower-priced fuels is common in South Asia, including India.[45] Some adulterants increase emissions of harmful pollutants from vehicles, worsening urban air pollution. Financial incentives arising from differential taxes are generally the primary cause of fuel adulteration. In India and other developing countries, gasoline carries a much higher tax than diesel, which in turn is taxed more than kerosene meant as a cooking fuel, while some solvents and lubricants carry little or no tax. As fuel prices rise, the public transport driver cuts costs by blending the cheaper hydrocarbon into highly taxed hydrocarbon. The blending may be as much as 20-30 percent. For a low wage driver, the adulteration can yield short term savings that are significant over the month. The consequences to long term air pollution, quality of life and effect on health are simply ignored. Also ignored are the reduced life of vehicle engine and higher maintenance costs, particularly if the taxi, auto-rickshaw or truck is being rented for a daily fee.\\n\\nAdulterated fuel increases tailpipe emissions of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). Air toxin emissions — which fall into the category of unregulated emissions — of primary concern are benzene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), both well known carcinogens. Kerosene is more difficult to burn than gasoline; its addition results in higher levels of HC, CO and PM emissions even from catalyst-equipped cars. The higher sulfur level of kerosene is another issue. The permissible level of fuel sulfur in India, in 2002, was 0.25 percent by weight as against 0.10 percent for gasoline. The higher levels of sulfur can deactivate the catalyst. Once the catalyst becomes deactivated, the amount of pollution from the vehicle dramatically increases. Fuel adulteration is essentially an unintended consequence of tax policies and the attempt to control fuel prices, in the name of fairness. Air pollution is the ultimate result. This problem is not unique to India, but prevalent in many developing countries including those outside of south Asia. This problem is largely absent in economies that do not regulate the ability of fuel producers to innovate or price based on market demand.\\n\\nTraffic congestion\\n\\nTraffic congestion is severe in India's cities and towns. Traffic congestion is caused for several reasons, some of which are: increase in number of vehicles per kilometer of available road, a lack of intra-city divided-lane highways and intra-city expressways networks, lack of inter-city expressways, traffic accidents and chaos from poor enforcement of traffic laws.\\n\\nTraffic congestion reduces average traffic speed. At low speeds, scientific studies reveal, vehicles burn fuel inefficiently and pollute more per trip. For example, a study in the United States found that for the same trip, cars consumed more fuel and polluted more if the traffic was congested, than when traffic flowed freely. At average trip speeds between 20 to 40 kilometers per hour, the cars pollutant emission was twice as much as when the average speed was 55 to 75 kilometers per hour. At average trip speeds between 5 to 20 kilometers per hour, the cars pollutant emissions were 4 to 8 times as much as when the average speed was 55 to 70 kilometers per hour.[46] Fuel efficiencies similarly were much worse with traffic congestion.\\n\\nTraffic gridlock in Delhi and other India cities is extreme.[47] The average trip speed on many Indian city roads is less than 20 kilometers per hour; a 10 kilometer trip can take 30 minutes, or more. At such speeds, vehicles in India emit air pollutants 4 to 8 times more than they would with less traffic congestion; Indian vehicles also consume a lot more carbon footprint fuel per trip, than they would if the traffic congestion was less.\\n\\nIn cities like Bangalore, around 50% of children suffer from asthma.[48]\\n\\nRecent trends in India's air quality\\n\\nMonsoons scrub India's air, bringing its natural diversity in better view.\\nHimalayan peaks in eastern India on a day without haze.\\n\\nWith the last 15 years of economic development and regulatory reforms, India has made progress in improving its air quality. The table presents the average emissions sampled at many locations, over time, and data analyzed by scientific methods, by multiple agencies, including The World Bank. For context and comparison, the table also includes average values for Sweden in 2008, observed and analyzed by same methods. Over 1995-2008, average nationwide levels of major air pollutants have dropped by between 25-45 percent in India.\\nAir quality, trends over 1995-2008, averaged for India Air quality indicator[49] 	India 	India 	India 	Sweden\\n	1995 	2005 	2008 	2008\\nPollutant, PM10 (micrograms per cubic meter) 	109 	67 	59 	11\\nPollutant, CO2 emissions (kg per 2005 PPP$ of GDP) 	0.7 	0.6 	0.5 	0.2\\nHealth, mortality rate (under 5, per 1000) 	100 	73 	67 	3\\nPollutant, methane, Agriculture emissions (% total) 	68.8 	64.4 	n.a. 	28.1\\nPollutant, nitrous oxide, Agriculture emissions (% total) 	75.2 	73.4 	n.a. 	60.2\\n\\nIndia's Central Pollution Control Board now routinely monitors four air pollutants namely sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), suspended particulate matter (SPM) and respirable particulate matter (PM10). These are target air pollutants for regular monitoring at 308 operating stations in 115 cities/towns in 25 states and 4 Union Territories of India. The monitoring of meteorological parameters such as wind speed and direction, relative humidity and temperature has also been integrated with the monitoring of air quality. The monitoring of these pollutants is carried out for 24 hours (4-hourly sampling for gaseous pollutants and 8-hourly sampling for particulate matter) with a frequency of twice a week, to yield 104 observations in a year.\\n\\nFor 2010, the key findings of India's central pollution control board are:[50]\\n\\n    * Most Indian cities continue to violate India's and world air quality PM10 targets. Respirable particulate matter pollution remains a key challenge for India. Despite the general non-attainment, some cities showed far more improvement than others. A decreasing trend has been observed in PM10 levels in cities like Solapur and Ahmedabad over the last few years. This improvement may be due to local measures taken to reduce sulphur in diesel and stringent enforcement by Gujarat government.\\n    * A decreasing trend has been observed in sulphur dioxide levels in residential areas of many cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Bhopal during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced clean fuel standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood, and the use of LPG instead of diesel in certain vehicles.\\n    * A decreasing trend has been observed in nitrogen dioxide levels in residential areas of some cities such as Bhopal and Solapur during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced vehicle emission standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood.\\n    * Most Indian cities greatly exceed acceptable levels of suspended particulate matter. This may be because of refuse and biomass burning, vehicles, power plant emissions, industrial sources.\\n    * The Indian air quality monitoring stations reported lower levels of PM10 and suspended particulate matter during monsoon months possibly due to wet deposition and air scrubbing by rainfall. Higher levels of particulates were observed during winter months possibly due to lower mixing heights and more calm conditions. In other words, India's air quality worsens in winter months, and improves with the onset of monsoon season.\\n\\nFor its 2008 annual report, Central Pollution Control Board used 346 operating Air Quality Monitoring Stations, covering 130 cities / towns in 26 States and 4 Union Territories. With the weekly data collected and then averaged over the year, Central Pollution Control Board reported the following annual trends from 1998 to 2008:[24]\\n\\n    * The average annual SOx and NOx emissions level and periodic violations in industrial areas of India were significantly and surprisingly lower than the emission and violations in residential areas of India.\\n    * The 24-hour average PM10 and suspended particulate matter emissions and violations in almost all areas of India violated India's and WHO targets. The PM10 and suspended particulate matter concentrations, in industrial areas of India were, however, lower than those in residential areas of India. Residential areas of India were the source of over 90% of the most serious and repeated violations in particulate air pollution.\\n    * Of the four major Indian cities, air pollution was consistently worst in Delhi, every year over 5 year period (2004–2008). Kolkata was a close second, followed by Mumbai. Chennai air pollution was least of the four.\\n    * The states of Kerala and Meghalaya, relative to other Indian states, experienced on average some of lowest air pollution levels. The cities of Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam and Shillong, relative to other Indian cities and towns, experienced some of lowest air pollution levels.\\n    * Air Quality data collected from the monitoring station at Taj Mahal, Agra since year 1991 to 2008, suggests that both particulate and acid rain pollutants at Taj Mahal have been declining over the years. The 2008 average annual air pollutant concentrations were between 38 to 67% lower than those in 1991.\\n\\n[edit] Solid waste pollution\\nSolid waste adds to water pollution in India, a 2005 image.\\nTrash and garbage disposal services, responsibility of local government workers in India, are ineffective. Solid waste is routinely seen along India's streets and shopping plazas. Image shows solid waste pollution along a Jaipur street, a 2011 image.\\n\\nTrash and garbage is a common sight in urban and rural areas of India. It is a major source of pollution. Indian cities alone generate more than 100 million tons of solid waste a year. Street corners are piled with trash. Public places and sidewalks are despoiled with filth and litter, rivers and canals act as garbage dumps. In part, India's garbage crisis is from rising consumption. India's waste problem also points to a stunning failure of governance.[7]\\n\\nIn 2000, India's Supreme Court directed all Indian cities to implement a comprehensive waste-management program that would include household collection of segregated waste, recycling and composting. These directions have simply been ignored. No major city runs a comprehensive program of the kind envisioned by the Supreme Court. Indeed, forget waste segregation and recycling directive of the India's Supreme Court, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that up to 40 percent of municipal waste in India remains simply uncollected. Even medical waste, theoretically controlled by stringent rules that require hospitals to operate incinerators, is routinely dumped with regular municipal garbage. A recent study found that about half of India's medical waste is improperly disposed of.\\n\\nMunicipalities in Indian cities and towns have waste collection employees. However, these are unionized government workers and their work performance is neither measured nor monitored.\\n\\nSome of the few solid waste landfills India has, near its major cities, are overflowing and poorly managed. They have become significant sources of greenhouse emissions and breeding sites for disease vectors such as flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches, rats, and other pests.[51]\\n\\nIn 2011, several Indian cities embarked on waste-to-energy projects of the type in use in Germany, Switzerland and Japan.[52] For example, New Delhi is implementing two incinerator projects aimed at turning the city’s trash problem into electricity resource. These plants are being welcomed for addressing the city’s chronic problems of excess untreated waste and a shortage of electric power. They are also being welcomed by those who seek to prevent water pollution, hygiene problems, and eliminate rotting trash that produces potent greenhouse gas methane. The projects are being opposed by waste collection workers and local unions who fear changing technology may deprive them of their livelihood and way of life.[53]\\n\\nAlong with waste-to-energy projects, some cities and towns such as Pune, Maharashtra are introducing competition and the privatization of solid waste collection, street cleaning operations and bio-mining to dispose the waste. A scientific study suggests public private partnership is, in Indian context, more useful in solid waste management. According to this study, government and municipal corporations must encourage PPP-based local management through collection, transport and segregation and disposal of solid waste.[54]\\n[edit] Noise pollution\\n[icon] 	This section requires expansion.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court of India gave a significant verdict on noise pollution in 2005.[55] Unnecessary honking of vehicles makes for a high decibel level of noise in cities. The use of loudspeakers for political purposes and by temples and mosques make for noise pollution in residential areas because using more speakers in an programs the noise is increase.\\n\\nIn January 2010, Government of India published norms of permissible noise levels in urban and rural areas.[56]\\n[edit] Land pollution\\n\\nIn March 2009, the issue of Uranium poisoning in Punjab came into light, caused by fly ash ponds of thermal power stations, which reportedly lead to severe birth defects in children in the Faridkot and Bhatinda districts of Punjab.[57][58][59][60]\\n[edit] Environmental issues and Indian law\\n\\nSince about late 1980s, the Supreme Court of India has been pro-actively engaged in India's environmental issues. In most countries, it is the executive and the legislative branches of the government that plan, implement and address environmental issues; the Indian experience is different. The Supreme Court of India has been engaged in interpreting and introducing new changes in the environmental jurisprudence directly. The Court has laid down new principles to protect the environment, re-interpreted environmental laws, created new institutions and structures, and conferred additional powers on the existing ones through a series of directions and judgments. The Court’s directions on environmental issues goes beyond the general questions of law, as is usually expected from the highest Court of a democratic country. The Supreme Court of India, in its order, includes executive actions and technical details of environmental actions to be implemented. Indeed, some critics of India's Supreme Court describe the Court as the Lords of Green Bench or Garbage Supervisor. Supporters of India's Supreme Court term these orders and the Indian bench as pioneering, both in terms of laying down new principles of law, and in delivering environmental justice.[61]\\n\\nThe reasons for the increasing interjection of India's Supreme Court in governance arenas are, experts claim, complex. A key factor has been the failure of government agencies and the state owned enterprises in discharging their Constitutional and Statutory duties. This has prompted civil society groups to file public interest complaints with the Courts, particularly the Supreme Court, for suitable remedies.\\n\\nPublic interest litigation and judicial activism on environmental issues extends beyond India's Supreme Court. It includes the High Courts of individual states.\\n\\nIndia's judicial activism on environmental issues has, some suggest, delivered positive effects to the Indian experience. The Supreme Court has, through intense judicial activism, the proponents claim, become a symbol of hope for the people of India. As a result of judicial activism, India's Supreme Court has delivered a new normative regime of rights and insisted that the Indian state cannot act arbitrarily but must act reasonably and in public interest on pain of its action being invalidated by judicial intervention.[62]\\n\\nIndia's judicial activism on environmental issues has, others suggest, had adverse consequences. Public interest cases are repeatedly filed to block infrastructure projects aimed at solving environmental issues in India, such as but not limiting to water works, expressways, land acquisition for projects, and electricity power generation projects. The litigation routinely delays such projects, often for years, while rampant pollution continues in India, and tens of thousands die from the unintended effects of pollution. Even after a stay related to an infrastructure project is vacated, or a court order gives a green light to certain project, new issues become grounds for court notices and new public interest litigation.[63][64][65]\\n\\nJudicial activism in India has, in several key cases, found state-directed economic development ineffective and a failure, then interpreted laws and issued directives that encourage greater competition and free market to reduce environmental pollution. In other cases, the interpretations and directives have preserved industry protection, labor practices and highly polluting state-owned companies detrimental to environmental quality of India.[66]\\n[edit] Conservation\\nGreater adjutant perched on a pile of trash and solid waste in Assam.\\nThe world's rarest monkey, the golden langur.\\nForests of India's Western Ghats\\nForests of Kerala.

Poor air quality, water pollution and garbage pollution - all affect the food and environment quality necessary for ecosystems.\\n\\nIndia is a large and diverse country. Its land area includes regions with some of the world's highest rainfall to very dry deserts, coast line to alpine regions, river deltas to tropical islands. The variety and distribution of forest vegetation is large. India is one of the 12 mega biodiverse regions of the world.\\n\\nIndian forests types include tropical evergreens, tropical deciduous, swamps, mangroves, sub-tropical, montane, scrub, sub-alpine and alpine forests. These forests support a variety of ecosystems with diverse flora and fauna.\\n\\nUntil recently, India lacked an objective way to determine the quantity of forests it had, and the quality of forests it had.\\n\\nForest cover measurement methods\\n\\nPrior to 1980s, India deployed a bureaucratic method to estimate forest coverage. A land was notified as covered under Indian Forest Act, and then officials deemed this land area as recorded forest even if it was devoid of vegetation. By this forest-in-name-only method, the total amount of recorded forest, per official Indian records, was 71.8 million hectares. Any comparison of forest coverage number of a year before 1987 for India, to current forest coverage in India, is thus meaningless; it is just bureaucratic record keeping, with no relation to reality or meaningful comparison.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, space satellites were deployed for remote sensing of real forest cover. Standards were introduced to classify India's forests into the following categories:\\n\\n    * Forest Cover: defined as all lands, more than one hectare in area, with a tree canopy density of more than 10 percent. (Such lands may or may not be statutorily notified as forest area).\\n          o Very Dense Forest: All lands, with a forest cover with canopy density of 70 percent and above\\n          o Moderately Dense Forest: All lands, with a forest cover with canopy density of 40-70 percent\\n          o Open Forest: All lands, with forest cover with canopy density of 10 to 40 percent\\n          o Mangrove Cover: Mangrove forest is salt tolerant forest ecosystem found mainly in tropical and sub-tropical coastal and/or inter-tidal regions. Mangrove cover is the area covered under mangrove vegetation as interpreted digitally from remote sensing data. It is a part of forest cover and also classified into three classes viz. very dense, moderately dense and open.\\n          o Non Forest Land: defined as lands without any forest cover\\n    * Scrub Cover: All lands, generally in and around forest areas, having bushes and or poor tree growth, chiefly small or stunted trees with canopy density less than 10 percent\\n    * Tree Cover: Land with tree patches (blocks and linear) outside the recorded forest area exclusive of forest cover and less than the minimum mapable area of 1 hectare\\n    * Trees Outside Forests: Trees growing outside Recorded Forest Areas\\n\\nThe first satellite recorded forest coverage data for India became available in 1987. India and the United States cooperated in 2001, using Landsat MSS with spatial resolution of 80 meters, to get accurate Indian forest distribution data. India thereafter switched to digital image and advanced satellites with 23 meters resolution and software processing of images to get more refined data on forest quantity and forest quality. India now assesses its forest distribution data biennially. The 2007 forest census data thus obtained and published by the Government of India suggests the five states with largest area under forest cover as the following:[67]\\n\\n    * Madhya Pradesh: 7.64 million hectares\\n    * Arunachal Pradesh: 6.8 million hectares\\n    * Chhattisgarh: 5.6 million hectares\\n    * Orissa: 4.83 million hectares\\n    * Maharashtra: 4.68 million hectares\\n\\nIndia hosts significant biodiversity; it is home to 7.6% of all mammalian, 12.6% of avian, 6.2% of reptilian, and 6.0% of flowering plant species.[68]\\n\\nIn recent decades, human encroachment has posed a threat to India's wildlife; in response, a system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was substantially expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial habitat; further federal protections were promulgated in the 1980s. Along with over 500 wildlife sanctuaries, India now hosts 14 biosphere reserves, four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; 25 wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.\\n\\nThese laws did not have the effect they intended.\\n\\nIn 1985, India created the Ministry of Environment and Forests. This was followed by a National Forest Policy and the major government reforms of early 1990s.\\n\\nOver the last 20 years, India has reversed the deforestation trend. Specialists of the United Nations report India's forest as well as woodland cover has increased. A 2010 study by the Food and Agriculture Organization ranks India amongst the 10 countries with the largest forest area coverage in the world (the other nine being Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, United States of America, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Australia, Indonesia and Sudan).[12] India is also one the top 10 countries with the largest primary forest coverage in the world, according to this study.\\n\\nFrom 1990 to 2000, FAO finds India was the fifth largest gainer in forest coverage in the world; while from 2000 to 2010, FAO considers India as the third largest gainer in forest coverage.[12]\\n\\nNational Forest Commission and India's afforestation program\\n\\nIn 2003, India set up a National Forest Commission to review and assess India's policy and law, its effect on India's forests, its impact of local forest communities, and to make recommendations to achieve sustainable forest and ecological security in India.[69] The report made over 300 recommendations including the following:\\n\\n    * India must pursue rural development and animal husbandry policies to address local communities need to find affordable cattle fodder and grazing. To avoid destruction of local forest cover, fodder must reach these communities on reliable roads and other infrastructure, in all seasons year round.\\n    * The Forest Rights Bill is likely to be harmful to forest conservation and ecological security. The Forest Rights Bill became a law since 2007.\\n    * The government should work closely with mining companies. Revenue generated from lease of mines must be pooled into a dedicated fund to conserve and improve the quality of forests in the region where the mines are located.\\n    * Power to declare ecologically sensitive areas must be with each Indian state.\\n    * The mandate of State Forest Corporations and government owned monopolies must be changed.\\n    * Government should reform regulations and laws that ban felling of trees and transit of wood within India. Sustainable agro-forestry and farm forestry must be encouraged through financial and regulatory reforms, particularly on privately owned lands.\\n\\nIndia's national forest policy expects to invest US$ 26.7 billion by 2020, to pursue nationwide afforestation coupled with forest conservation, with the goal of increasing India's forest cover from 20% to 33%.[70]
I am a scientist at a university in the American Pacific Northwest studying structural and molecular parasitology.  I look for parasite genes that could be vulnerable to antiparasitic drugs and examine the structures of target parasite proteins for ways to make drugs more potent and less toxic to people.  My focus is to develop better treatments for Trypanosoma cruzi infection, the cause of Chagas disease, and related trypanosomatid Leishmania species.  Along with lab science, I have done advocacy and community building work on affordability of medicines to people living in poverty and development of new health technologies (drugs, diagnostics, vaccines) for neglected infections of poverty.
{{onesource|date=December 2015}}\\n{{short description|Type of emergency that causes severe environmental damage}}\\nAn '''environmental emergency''' is defined as a "sudden-onset disaster or accident resulting from natural, technological or human-induced factors, or a combination of these, that causes or threatens to cause severe environmental damage as well as loss of human lives and property." (UNEP/GC.22/INF/5, 13 November 2002.)\\n\\nFollowing a disaster or conflict, an environmental emergency can occur when people's health and livelihoods are at risk due to the release of hazardous and noxious substances, or because of significant damage to the ecosystem. Examples include fires, [[oil spill]]s, [[chemical accident]]s, [[toxic waste dump]]ing and [[groundwater pollution]]. \\n\\nThe environmental risks can be acute and life-threatening. According to the International Disaster Database ([http://www.emdat.be/ EM-DAT]), between 2003 and 2013, there were 380 industrial accidents reported, affecting 207 668 people and resulting in over US$22 million in losses. Climate change is having an unprecedented effect on the occurrence of natural disasters and the associated risk of environmental emergencies. With climate change already stretching the disaster relief system, future climate-related emergency events will generate increased and more costly demands for assistance.\\n\\n== Context ==\\nAll disasters have some environmental impacts.  \\n\\nSome of these may be immediate and life-threatening – for example, when an earthquake damages an industrial facility, which in turn releases hazardous materials. In such cases these so-called 'secondary impacts' may cause as much damage as the initial causal factor. \\n\\nFor example, [[Typhoon Haiyan]]/Yolanda that struck the Philippines in November 2013, caused massive destruction and had a huge human toll but also generated a spill of around 800,000 litres of heavy oil, when a power barge ran aground in Estancia, Iloilo province, at the height of the typhoon. \\n\\nDisasters may also have longer-term impacts. For example, natural disasters may cause long-term waste management difficulties or [[ecosystem]] damage.\\n\\n== Major international conferences ==\\nThe Environmental Emergencies Forum is a unique biennial international forum that brings together disaster managers and environmental experts from governments, [[UN]] agencies, industries, academies, NGOs and civil society to improve prevention, preparedness, response and overall resilience to environmental emergencies. It also provides guidance for the Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit, which provides a Secretariat to the meeting. The most recent meeting was held in Norway in June 2015. The next meeting will be held in Nairobi in June 2017.\\n\\n== Relevant organizations ==\\n\\n===United Nations===\\nThe Joint [http://www.unep.org/ United Nations Environment Programme] (UNEP)/[http://www.unocha.org/ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs] (OCHA) Environment Unit (JEU): By pairing the UNEP's technical expertise with OCHA's humanitarian response network, the Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit (JEU) mobilizes and coordinates a comprehensive response to environmental emergencies to protect lives, livelihoods, ecosystems and future generations. The JEU can be reached 24 hours/day, seven days/week, all year round and operates at the request of affected countries.

Authorities continue to ban or disperse most public demonstrations. Politicians and journalists critical of the government face violence and intimidation and are barred from equal access to the broadcast media. In addition, the judiciary remains weak and subject to political influence. Trafficking of women and children for sexual exploitation through networks protected or backed by police or government officials is rampant. The government continues to turn a blind eye to fraudulent confiscation of farmers’ land, illegal logging, and widespread plundering of natural resources.\\n\\nPolitician, particularly those speeching on abuse of power or corruption and democracy, were at risk of investigation by the police on charges of his political opinions.\\n\\n* In June, Batzandan Jalbasuren, the head of the Just Society Civic Movement was detained for 41 days in a pre-trial detention centre.

What is CGIF?\\n\\nThe CGIF was established in November 2010 to promote financial stability and to boost long-term investment in the ASEANa+3 region (the "Region"). CGIF will provide guarantees on local currency denominated bonds issued by corporations in the Region. Such guarantees will make it easier for corporations to issue local currency bonds with longer maturities. This will help reduce the currency and maturity mismatches that caused the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis and make the Region's financial system more resilient to volatile global capital flows and external shocks. \\n\\nWhat are the priorities of CGIF? What kind of activities may be guaranteed by the facility?\\n\\nThe aim of CGIF is to help companies that otherwise would have difficulty tapping local bond markets to secure longer-term financing, reduce their dependency on short-term foreign currency borrowing to mitigate currency and maturity mismatches. Increased issuances of local currency bonds will promote financial stability in the Region and aid the development of ASEAN's bond markets.\\n\\nWho are eligible for CGIF guarantees?\\n\\nCGIF will provide guarantees for local currency denominated bonds issued by investment grade corporations in the Region.\\n\\nWho supports the fund?\\n\\nCGIF has received capital contributions of $700 million from ASEAN, the People's Republic of China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and ADB.\\n\\na ASEAN member countries: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam.
I never find it easy to write about myself, particularly when this is being posted to an open access website like Wikipedia and when I am using my real name! My main interest at the moment is related to financial organisations, monetary policy and potential impacts of financial institutions (in the broad sense) on financial stability. In particular I am currently at Cambridge University getting engaged with some of the literature on pricing and value theory, econometrics of financial markets, monetary theories of production, international capital markets and heterodox economic theory, having chosen to take a career break and participate in a Masters of Philosophy taught by the Center of Development Studies. Within this context, I have a particular interest in the advantages and disadvantages of the process of globalization of financial systems for both developed and developing countries. As you can probably appreciate, much of what I have learnt has direct application to some of the financial crises of recent years and my hope in participating in Wikipedia is to contribute a 'pluralist' voice in the context of an apparent failure of mainstream theory to prevent or explain recent events in the global economy.
'''Patrick Shanahan:  artist-photographer'''\\n\\nPatrick Shanahan (born Manchester, England, 1955) is a British artist-photographer whose photographs investigate the contemporary cultural landscape, offering a seductive and unsettling re-imaging of modern urban environments.\\n\\nMaking full use of the scenographic, artificial aspects of large-scale photography, he produces topographic images that are close to the kinds of minimalism found in painting and sculpture. These largely unpopulated compositions are subjected to a pristine finish and treatment of light, colour and space that help to establish a tension between a real and constructed landscape - a landscape in which the distinction between reality and imagination seem to blur and we are left with a peculiar sense of spatial estrangement.\\n\\nShanahan works with a variety of medium and large-format cameras and shoots on colour negative film. The film is digitally scanned and then worked on in Photoshop. Large-scale chromogenic dye-coupler prints are produced in limited editions - see artist website for details.\\n\\nThe result is hyperreal and illusory images that transform the environs we may be used to seeing into something disturbing and strange - images that pose the artificial and natural in opposition to one another. We feel simultaneously connected to and spatially estranged from them and, in blurring the distinction between reality and imagination, his photographs alter the way we see and relate to the world.
Who invented Gunpowder? \\n\\nDuring the Tang Dynasty, around 850 A.D, an enterprising alchemist (whose name has been lost to history) mixed 75 parts saltpeter with 15 parts charcoal and 10 parts sulfur. This mixture had no discernible life-lengthening properties, but it did explode with a flash and a bang when exposed to an open flame. According to a text from that era, "smoke and flames result, so that [the alchemists'] hands and faces have been burnt, and even the whole house where they were working burned down."\\n\\nMany western history books over the years have stated that the Chinese used this discovery only for fireworks, but that is not true. Song Dynasty military forces as early as 904 A.D. used gunpowder devices against their primary enemy, the Mongols. These weapons included "flying fire" (fei huo), an arrow with a burning tube of gunpowder attached to the shaft. Flying fire arrows were miniature rockets, which propelled themselves into enemy ranks and inspired terror among both men and horses. It must have seemed like fearsome magic to the first warriors who were confronted with the power of gunpowder.
'''\\n== [['''''Christopher Columbus sighted the island of Jamaica during his second voyage, and it became a Spanish colony in 1509. Saint Jago de la Vega (now Spanish Town) was founded about 1523. Colonization was slow under Spanish rule. \\nJamaica was captured by an English naval force under Sir William Penn in 1655. The island was formally transferred to England in 1670. During the final decades of the 17th century, growing numbers of English immigrants arrived; the sugar, cacao, and other agricultural and forest industries were rapidly expanded; and the consequent demand for plantation labor led to large-scale importation of black slaves. Jamaica soon became one of the principal slave-trading centers in the world. But, by 1838, slavery was abolished by parliamentary legislation, and $30 million was granted as compensation to the owners of the nearly 310,000 liberated slaves.\\n\\n\\nLarge numbers of the freed blacks abandoned the plantations following emancipation and took possession of unoccupied lands in the interior, gravely disrupting the economy. Labor shortages, bankrupt plantations, and declining trade resulted in a protracted economic crisis.

{{User:Kpalion/Polish cuisine sidebox}}\\n\\nThe '''history of [[Polish cuisine]]''' has been shaped by such factors as the country's climate, a mostly agrarian lifestyle with parallel strains of rustic and luxurious culinary tradition, religious dietary requirements of the Catholic Church, external influences coming from various directions, as well as periods of scarcity and culinary monotony, notably during the Second World and Cold Wars. \\n\\nDue to Poland's location in a moderate temperate climate with frosty winters and a relatively short growing season, storage of food for several colder months, when fresh produce becomes largely unavailable, is a necessity. Before the advent of modern preservation techniques, such pasteurization and refrigeration, Poles relied on such traditional methods as salting-curing, pickling by lactic fermentation or acidification in vinegar, as well as smoking and drying. As a result, salty, sour and smoky flavors are typical of many Polish foods. Traditional Polish cooking is highly seasonal. ''Add examples of foods availably only during certain seasons.''\\n\\nThe official adoption of Western-rite Christianity in the 10th century CE meant that the natural seasonality has been compounded with the Roman Catholic liturgical calendar of alternating festive and fasting periods. Polish people still associate certain foods with specific religious holidays, such as Easter and Christmas. Many Poles fast every Friday, the day of the week associated with the crucifixion of Jesus, by refraining from eating land-animal meat and opting for fish instead.\\n\\nThroughout most of Poland's history, it was a predominantly agricultural country with a large portion of the population living off the fields and pastures which they tended themselves. An agrarian lifestyle with an emphasis on self-sufficience has played an important role in the shaping of Polish cuisine. Food production has always been supplemented with foraging and hunting in forests, enriching\\nthe Polish table with a variety of berries, mushrooms and game. An income gap, which grew in the early modern period between the peasants and petty nobility on the one hand and affluent grain-exporting magnates on the other, led to two separate strains in Polish culinary history – a simple rustic fare dominated by groats and flour-based foods, cabbage and root vegetables, as well as animal fats as a substitute for meat, versus lordly cuisine featuring choice meats, expensive sugar and exotic spices. The latter was played down under the Communist regime, but has been making a comeback in the 21st century and Polish cuisine draws from both currents today.\\n\\n* foreign influence: English, French, Italian, German, Czech, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Russian, Tatar, Jewish, Armenian, Turkish, etc.\\n* periods of scarcity: importance of culinary creativity\\n\\n{{TOC limit|3}}\\n\\n== Middle Ages ==\\n{{See also|Medieval cuisine|Regional cuisines of medieval Europe}}\\n[[File:Ur-painting.jpg|thumb|Copy of a 16th-century painting of an aurochs]]\\nInformation about Polish medieval cuisine is scant.

The [[Heracleum mantegazzianum|giant hogweed]], known in Polish as ''barszcz'', was used to make a soup to which it lent its name.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=126–129}} Additionally, apples, pears, plums, sweet and sour cherries, and hazelnuts were grown in the orchards.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=132}} \\n\\nAll social groups consumed fairly large amounts of meat, mostly pork. Pigs, resembling small wild boars, were grazed in oak and beech forests.{{sfnp|Chwalba|2008|p=56}} Cattle was raised mostly for draft and milk, so beef was a more expensive treat. Both of these kinds of meat, as well as poultry, were usually spit-roasted, but also stewed, boiled, barbecued or pickled in their own jelly.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=83–94}} The immense forests, which then covered most of the country, were a source of game, which served as an important addition to the meat of domestic animals. Poles commonly hunted the small game, such as hares, [[beaver]]s, [[badger]]s, [[Grey Partridge|partridges]], and [[black grouse]], and occasionally the big game, from [[roe deer]] to [[red deer]], elk ([[moose]]), wild boars, bears, [[European bison|wisent]], to [[aurochs]], the now-extinct ancestor of domestic cattle.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=84–85, 94–96}}\\n\\n* Seasonality, pickled vegetables, salted meat, ''rosół''\\n* [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church]].

Wyken Seagrave is passionate about using the history of the Universe to integrate a wide range of scientific, historical and social knowledge into a single unified story.\\n\\n“In a world facing many global problems, everyone can gain by understanding basic science, knowing where we came from and understanding the options facing us,” he says.\\n\\nWyken has been studying and writing about this subject for 40 years, both as an historical narrative and as fiction. His first book, Global Vision, was published in 1992 by Penny Press, a company dedicated to publishing on this subject, under the name Philip Brown. He converted the book to a website in 1998, and www.historyoftheuniverse.com now gets around 1 million visitors each year.\\n\\n“Seeing ourselves in a universal context is a salutary experience, giving us a new perspective on our current problems, many of which are on a global scale. To solve them will require global solutions. We all need to make important decisions about our ways of life. We need to understand what caused our problems and what options we have for solving them. We can only obtain this by taking a global perspective,” Wyken claims.\\n\\nHe began to write the story as a work of fiction in 2002, and published The Cosmic Monopole in 2011. This is the first volume of a sci-fi fantasy romance which will take the readers on a trip back through time to the Big Bang (and beyond) on an effort to save the Universe.

\\nSemantic Web:\\n\\nToday we are living in the information age and society can be labeled as information society. Knowledge, a predominant element, pervades and dominates in the day-to-day activities in information society.  There is Emergence of internet and the development in ICT (Information Communications Technology), which affects every aspect of human life. Present rapid development in communication system and recent innovation in technology witnessed as changing emphasis in the role of information and management. The end users approach to meeting information needs is also rapidly getting transformed.  The new technologies have facilitated the transformation of data into digital formats. The availability and use of digital libraries is gradually becoming the norm for the provision of literature and information in all the fields and research. Digital Libraries are catering to information services interacting with online databases of journals and other resources Digital Library are important in creating, indexing and retrieving the various forms of digital resources.
== McJondalds ==\\n\\n\\n'''McJondalds''' is a sexually transmitted disease that usually begins by affecting use of the right side of women and the left side of men. \\n\\n\\n\\n== Stages ==\\nThere are several different stages of this disease, the first being crying or laughing uncontrollably, and repeated self-urination. The secondary stage includes a severe increase in appetite, irritability, and excessive exhaustion. The third and fatal stage occurs when the individual begins to consume large quantities of Iced Tea, dance uncontrollably, and be increasingly afraid of dark basements in their Grandmother's houses.\\n\\n== Causes==\\nMcJondalds can be contracted by sleeping in a small bed next to an infected individual. The chances of contracting McJondalds increases if the infected individual's hindquarters comes in close proximity to the other individual's hindquarters.\\nOther ways to contract McJondalds include: separation from a loved one for long periods of time, reversing day and night (staying up late/sleeping in late), consuming large amounts of frozen treats, spending large amounts of time on the internet and spying on family members.\\n\\n== History ==\\nMcJondalds is among the newest of sexually transmitted diseases. Current research shows that it is most common among cousins of the same age and also among chronic tea drinkers. Very little information is able to be located, on the account that very little is known.
==National Take Back Initiative==\\n\\nThe annual National Take Back Initiative in the United States occurs October 29.  This program is coordinated by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA).  Drug Take Back Programs are a common and environmentally < supportive venue for avoiding the improper disposal of unused pharmaceuticals.  \\n\\nIn 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, enough pharmaceuticals were prescribed to medicate every American adult around-the-clock for one month.   Some of these prescriptions and over the counter drugs decay in the home and are highly susceptible to diversion, misuse, and abuse.  Often, more Americans currently abuse prescription drugs than the number of those using cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, and inhalants combined, according to the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Studies show that the majority of teens who abuse prescription drugs obtain them from family or friends for free, including from the home medicine cabinet.  Improper disposal methods can pose both safety and environmental hazards.\\n\\nFour days following the DEA’s first Take-Back Day on September 25, 2010, Congress approved legislation that amended the [[Controlled Substances Act]].  This action provided the DEA with the option to develop a permanent process for people to safely and conveniently dispose of their prescription drugs. After October 12,President Obama signed the Safe and Secure Drug Disposal Act of 2010, and the DEA immediately began installing regulations for a more permanent solution.\\n\\nThe DEA’s Take-Back events are also a reflection of the President's prescription drug abuse prevention strategy entitled [[Epidemic: \\nResponding to America’s Prescription Drug Abuse Crisis]] developed and promoted by the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]]. Ridding medicine cabinets of unused or expired medications in American homes is one of the four main items addressed the strategy for reducing diversion prescription drug abuse. The other action items include educating the public as well as health care providers. In turn, this system establishes prescription drug monitoring programs in all the states.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}
The goal of '''American influence operations in Russia''' is to force Russia into supporting American foreign policy interests and diminish Russia's potential to act as a geopolitical rival to the United States. The methods used include attempts to organise regime change in Russia, followed by installation of a new government that would be friendly towards the United States and support all its policies. Destroying Russia's capability to act as a geopolitical rival is the aim of the neoconservative agenda, according to which America should try to prevent to rise of future rivals "by all means necessary".\\n\\n== Support for NGOs and political parties ==\\nFunding of agenda-based NGOs and support for political parties.

The season for BBQ’s is just around the corner and as expected, there has been an increase in demand for outdoor electric grills. Long gone are the days where people use to burn coal to enjoy a good BBQ. Many researches showed that burning coal to cook BBQ food is known to be quite harmful as it emits carbon gases which get stored in the food that is being cooked; seeing as we consume that food, it is known to cause a lot of problems in the human body.

'''Mobile Adhoc Network: Routing Protocols \\nMANET'''\\n\\nAn ad hoc network is a collection of mobile nodes using wireless network interfaces to communicate among themselves without using the existing network infrastructure or centralized administration. In the areas where there is little or no infrastructure is available or the existing wireless infrastructure is expensive and inconvenient to use, Mobile Ad hoc Networks, called MANETs, are becoming useful. A mobile ad hoc network is a set of mobile nodes able to communicate with other nodes in their surroundings. These wireless communications happen in a peer-to-peer manner instead of static(fixed) network infrastructure, dynamically forming a temporary network to exchange information without using any pre-existing fixed network infrastructure. They are going to become integral part of next generation mobile services. A MANET consists of mobile platforms (e.g., a router with multiple hosts and wireless communications devices) herein simply referred to as "nodes", which are free to move about randomly. The nodes may be located in or on airplanes, ships, trucks, cars, perhaps even on very small devices, and there may be multiple hosts per router. The network topology in a MANET usually changes with time thus nodes are free to move arbitrarily.
== Motobolosm ==\\n\\nAn autoimmune disorder affecting African tribesmen. The total number of affected men is undetermined due to poor data gathering in the third world. It is theorized that the disease originates as a liver enzyme deficiency but and in turn results in the immune system attacking vital bodily systems such as the liver, pancreas, lungs/respiratory and some suspect it may also be responsible for heart failures. The disease only affects men in third world countries and seems to be only life threatening in those with the darkest of skins. The blackest of the blackies.
== Rape Trees ==\\n\\n\\n\\nOver the past several decades, crimes against women and children, crossing the U.S mexican border have risen.   It is estimated that the Border Patrol receives reports on about three to four rapes a day of illegal immigrants along the 2,000-mile border- or 1,040 to 1,460 a year” (TAASA; June 5, 2006) These women pay men, called "coyotes", to transport them into the United States with promises of jobs and security once they cross the border.  In an horrifying turn of events,the perpatrators are documenting their crimes by creating 'rape trees'.   ‘Rape trees’ are used as trophies,visual reminders that let other criminals know how many women were raped at the site. They hang their underwear on trees along the border as a symbol of power over the helpless immigrants.The practice first started along the border and now occurs in the Unided States.  California, Texas and Arizona,for example, are three states where ‘rape trees’ are appearing. Many of these victims remain unknown and are never given the life they were promised.\\n\\nTo view our blog, click on the link below:\\n\\n[http://www.PreventRapeTrees.Blogspot.com]
'''Aphthoviruses'''\\n\\nFoot-and-mouth disease (FMD), sometimes called hoof-and-mouth disease, is a highly contagious viral disease of cattle and pigs.  It can also infect deer, goats, sheep, and other animals with cloven hooves, as well as elephants, rats, and hedgehogs.  Horses are not susceptible to FMD.  The cause of FMD was first shown to be viral in 1897 by Friedrich Loeffler.  He passed the blood of an infected animal through a fine porcelain-glass filter and found that the fluid that was collected could still cause the disease in healthy animals.  FMD occurs throughout much of the world, including parts of Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America.  While currently (July 2001) some countries, including Canada, the United States, and Australia, have been relatively free of FMD for some time, its wide host range and rapid spread represent cause for international concern.\\n\\nIn cattle, foot-and-mouth disease is characterized by high fever that declines rapidly after two or three days; blisters inside the mouth that lead to excessive secretion of stringy or foamy saliva and to drooling; and blisters on the feet that may rupture and cause lameness.  Adult animals may suffer weight loss from which they do not recover for several months, and in cows, milk production can decline significantly.  Though most animals eventually recover from FMD, the disease can lead to ''myocarditis'' (inflammation of the heart muscle) and death, especially in newborn animals.  Some infected animals remain asymptomatic, that is, they do not suffer from or show signs of the disease; but they are ''carriers'' of FMD and can transmit it to others.\\n\\nInfection with foot-and-mouth disease tends to occur locally, that is, the virus is passed on to susceptible animals through direct contact with infected animals or with contaminated pens or vehicles used to transport livestock.  The clothes and skin of animal handlers such as farmers, standing water, and uncooked food scraps and feed supplements containing infected animal products can harbor the virus as well.  Cows can also catch FMD from the semen of infected bulls.  Control measures include quarantine and destruction of infected livestock, and export bans for meat and other animal products to countries not infected with the disease.\\n\\nFoot-and-mouth disease is caused by an ''Aphthovirus'' [ap-thoh"-vei'-r&s]  of the viral family ''Picornaviridae''. [pi-kawr'-n&-vir"-id-ei]  The members of this family are small (25-30 nm), nonenveloped icosahedral [ei-koh<nowiki>''</nowiki>-s&-hee'-dr&l]  viruses that contain single-stranded ''RNA'' (''ribonucleid acid'', the viral genetic material).  When such a virus comes in contact with a host cell, it binds to a receptor site and triggers a folding-in of the cell membrane.  Once the virus is inside the host cell, its protein coat dissolves.  New viral RNA and components of the protein coat are then synthesized in large quantities and assembled to form new viruses.  After assembly, the host cell ''lyses'' (bursts) and releases the new viruses.\\n\\nHumans can be infected with foot-and-mouth disease through contact with infected animals, but this is extremely rare.  Because the virus that causes FMD is sensitive to stomach acid, it cannot spread to humans via consumption of infected meat.  In the UK, the last confirmed human case occurred in 1967, and only a few other cases have been recorded in countries of continental Europe, Africa, and South America.  Symptoms of FMD in humans include malaise, fever, vomiting, red ulcerative lesions (surface-eroding damaged spots) of the oral tissues, and sometimes vesicular lesions (small blisters) of the skin.  There is another viral disease with similar symptoms, commonly referred to as “hand, foot, and mouth disease,” that occurs more frequently in humans, especially in young children; this disease is caused by a different virus of the family Picornaviridae, namely, an ''Enterovirus'' called ''Coxsackie A''.  Because FMD rarely infects humans but spreads rapidly among animals, it is a much greater threat to the agriculture industry than to human health.  Farmers around the world can lose billions of dollars a year during a foot-and-mouth epidemic, when large numbers of animals are destroyed and revenues from milk and meat production go down. \\n\\n=== For Further Reading ===\\nLevy, Jay A., Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat, and Robert A.

The Taiwan music and art scene has been flourishing in recent years. The influx of foreign artists to the country have given rise to a diverse culture of Taiwanese and non Taiwanese alike working together. This cohesion has made Taiwan a breeding ground for new, diverse, cutting edge, art and music. With the reach of the internet, art and music lovers from almost any country can now appreciate the talent emerging from this small Pacific Island nation.\\nTaiwan has it's share of political strife. And reflected in trials and tribulations of any society comes music, art and literature.\\n\\nMilitant Hippi, a musical band of artists that hail from different parts of the globe, has burst on the Taiwan culture scene. With them they have brought music, video art and political messages for the masses.\\n\\nThe Militant Hippi agenda is to keep the masses aware though music, art, humor and literature. Their music is a blended fusion of reggae, hip hop, classical, jazz and good ol' rock N roll.
Trait theory is a major approach to the study of human personality. Trait theorists are primarily interested in the measurement of traits, which can be defined as habitual patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion.[1] According to this perspective, traits are relatively stable over time, differ among individuals (e.g. some people are outgoing whereas others are shy), and influence behavior.\\n\\nGordon Allport was an early pioneer in the study of traits, which he sometimes referred to as dispositions. In his approach, central traits are basic to an individual's personality, whereas secondary traits are more peripheral. Common traits are those recognized within a culture and may vary between cultures. Cardinal traits are those by which an individual may be strongly recognized. Since Allport's time, trait theorists have focused more on group statistics than on single individuals. Allport called these two emphases "nomothetic" and "idiographic," respectively.\\n\\nThere is a nearly unlimited number of potential traits that could be used to describe personality. The statistical technique of factor analysis, however, has demonstrated that particular clusters of traits reliably correlate together. Hans Eysenck has suggested that personality is reducible to three major traits.[2] [3] Other researchers argue that more factors are needed to adequately describe human personality.[4] Many psychologists currently believe that five factors are sufficient.[5] [6]\\n\\nVirtually all trait models, and even ancient Greek philosophy, include extraversion vs. introversion as a central dimension of human personality. Another prominent trait that is found in nearly all models is Neuroticism, or emotional instability.
9. The three major rock families are listed and described in the following. Igneous rock is formed by the cooling and consolidation of magma. Sedimentary rock is formed either by chemical precipitation of material carried in solution in sea, lake, or river water, or by the disposition of mineral particles transported in suspension by water, wind, or ice. Metamorphic rock is either igneous or sedimentary rock that has been changed as a result of high temperatures, high pressures, or both.\\n\\n12. Regolith is when rock is exposed at Earth's surface, it is susceptible to alteration by the action of water, wind, and other agents that may act to alter the composition of the minerals present or to break the rock apart. Three types are as followed. The surface blanket is the broken-up material that constitutes the regolith; forms a blanketing lair draped over most of Earth's surface. Sediment is a type on which the unconsolidated rock and mineral particles that constitute the regolith are collectively referred to as sediment. Soil is the last type that is a special type of regolith, which contains the organic matter mixed with the mineral component. \\n\\n14. Soil is derived from the decay of dead plants and animals. Living plants are nourished by the nutrients released from decaying organisms, as well as by the nutrients released during weathering. \\n\\npg. 218\\n\\n1. The rock cycle involves the cycling of material through the geosphere as a result of the formation, breakdown, rearrangement, and reformation of rock. The rock cycle comprises the processes whereby materials within and on top of the Earth's crust are weathered, transported, deposited, deformed, altered, melted. and reformed into new rock. \\n\\n3.

It is not just a film, but also a communication tool to raise awareness and encourage action to re-unite Mali, to stop the violation of human rights in the north of Mali, and to demand comprehensive relief aide for people affected by the rebel insurgences and the food and water shortage in the Sahel. Appealing to a global audience to stand in solidarity with these musicians and their messages, the film also emphasizes the urgent need for North and West Africans to come together to bring peace and unity in Mali and throughout the Sahel.\\n\\nSynopsis:\\nOften in Africa, musicians say what the politicans will not, and what the oppressed cannot. Whether international celebrities or local stars, the North and West African musicians of "Sahel Calling" tell us the story of strife and struggle in Mali and the Sahel. Of course, each musician has their own story, each rhythm its own history. The film honors this as it accompanies these musicians on a musical caravan through Mauritania, Mali and Burkina Faso.\\n\\nThe caravan is part of worldwide "Festival in Exile" which pays tribute to the Festival au Désert, a musical and cultural festival usually taking place in the north of Mali, now occupied by fundamentalist Islamic groups who ban the very creation and enjoyment of music. "Sahel Calling" questions the power of musicians in this time of humanitarian crisis, especially in light of the political, social, ethnic and religious complexities of Mali and the Sahel.
'''Reinstate the article''' The proggies/warez era had a huge impact on the AOL customer base in the early-to-late 1990s and was composed of thousands of people. It's also significant as one of the earliest manifestations of organized, automated software piracy, a precursor to the BitTorrents and P2P networks of today. There was no media coverage because the "public" internet was in its infancy, the media did not fully understand it, and even AOL didn't realize the scope of the problem on its hands. (Evidenced by the years-long effort to shut the scene down, glacial by today's standards and security practices.) When you consider the media's lack of fluency in internet matters even today, it becomes clear why there are no "official sources." But harping on the fact that there was no media coverage does nothing to deny the basic fact that this era (and scene) did exist and was highly significant for thousands of users of the most popular ISP of the 1990s. Lastly, it seems odd that an editor would be so dead-set on deleting the only article on Wikipedia on this particular subject.

To import alcoholic beverages into the United States the general rule is that one must possess both the appropriate State and Federal beverage alcohol licenses.  (Unless the distinction is important, the works "permit" and "license" will be used interchangably)  \\n\\nFor licensing, labeling and tax purposes, alcoholic beverages are catagorized as wine, malt beverage (ie:  beer, ale) or distilled spirits.\\n\\nFederal law requires that one obtain a "basic permit" to import the appropriate type of alcohol for commercial purposes.  \\n\\nFederal law and regulations also require each container of beverage alcohol be labeled with a standard health warning statement in any case where the alcohol may be sold or "distributed".  The term "distributed" is interpreted broadly and is not restricted to sales or commercial transactions.  (27 CFR Part 16.)  Note that the law and regulations provide for a civil penalty of $11,000 per violation.\\n\\nTo import alcoholic beverages without a permit, the importer must qualify for an exception to the general rule.

Media Studies\\n\\n We have all grown up in environments saturated with media experiences. The media are familiar and one of our first aims will be to make them strange - to allow you to distance yourself from something you know, in order to look at it differently. This familiarity, and the expectations it arouses, also creates problems for a Media Studies textbook. TV, from children's programs through educational TV, to the vast range of broadcast material has probably taught you a great deal, in ways which books cannot hope to emulate. You may also have quite sophisticated experience of computers, at home and at college, including interactive forms like CD-ROMS and the internet. Modern technologies have dazzling capacities. It is now possible, using digital imaging, to make it seem as though Marilyn Monroe and Brad Pitt are playing a scene together or that Earth can morph into an apple before our eyes; to broadcast such scenes and simultaneously \\nacross continents; and to accompany them with music created entirely by computer. The internet has been touted, like many earlier technologies, everything is readily available and all questions can be answered.
\\n== '''South China Learning Institute''' ==\\n\\n\\n\\nThe South China Learning Institute (SCLI) was established by an organization of American and European professionals who have lived and worked throughout China for many years. The creation of the Institute was a response to what they saw as a need for greater learning and exchange between China and other nations and the immense opportunities that China now offers. They decided to locate the Institute in Shenzhen, a city with 10 million people, in response to the dynamism and extreme growth that has defined the Pearl River Delta region for the past 20 years.\\n\\n\\nSCLI accepts participants from all backgrounds seeking a deeply productive China learning experience, be it in language or otherwise.\\n\\n\\nSCLI offers Intensive Mandarin Language courses, featuring classroom study, exchange, and a wide selection of unique cultural and educational electives. Additionally, SCLI offers programs involving internship placements with major international companies in Shenzhen.\\n\\n\\nSCLI provides all participants with lodging, travel support, and many exciting travel excursions around China. SCLI offers a variety of packages built to accommodate all levels of Mandarin skills, interests, and time frames. For lodging, students have the option to choose between a home stay program with a Chinese family, or a more communal setting with peers in downtown Shenzhen.
== '''Global Initiative for Essential and Emergency Surgical Care''' ==\\n\\n\\n\\n'''The Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care''' (GIEESC)was established by the World Health Organization in December 2005.  Its general purpose is to reduce “death and disability from road traffic accidents, trauma, burns, falls, pregnancy related complications, domestic violence, disasters and other emergency surgical conditions” by improving collaborations between relevant organizations, institutions, and agencies.  Specific objectives include improving basic medical supplies at district hospitals, as well as better training for staff to bolster medical standards and care.\\n\\n== Establishment of GIEESC ==\\nThe GIEESC is a partnership of organizations, NGO’s, institutions, and associations from third and first world countries.  This partnership will work together in creating solutions and meeting the Millennium Development Goals developed by the WHO—which include reducing maternal and child mortality rates, as well as reducing HIV rates—“through improvement in the quality and safety of clinical procedures (essential surgical and anaesthesia care).”\\n===Mission statement===\\nThe GIEESC's goals are: to improve the already existing training and education programs necessary to execute emergency and essential surgical care; to develop district hospitals’ surgical, obstetric, trauma, and anesthesia service; to train personnel with the appropriate strategies to treat patients; to continue education to maintain skills; and to develop a dependable system that facilitates access to medication and medicinal drugs.\\n===Challenges===\\nChallenges include: poor equipment to “perform simple but vital interventions such as resuscitation, the provision of oxygen, assessment of anemia, suctions, intercostal drainage and airway support,”  inadequate basic supplies, absence of specialized surgical teams and lack of anesthesia.
A general definition of an ecological crisis the occurrences when the environment of species or a population changes in a way that destabilizes its continued survival. The main cause of the ecological crisis are human induced activities or anthropocentric acts like mining, pollution, deforestations, construction etcetera, for the global economy to grow.\\nThe solutions to the contemporary ecological crisis is sustainable development. Sustainable development is a type of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, not only for anthropocentric reasons but nature holistically. The concept of sustainable will be successful when the current population stabilize for natural resources to be evenly distributed’ for developed countries like the United States not to consume products that they do not need but they can rather make it accessible to countries who need those resources. \\nThe lifestyle as humans that we all should adopt is a culture of living in an environmentally friendly way. Like reusing, afforestation, and adopting traditions that have certain laws to use the environment sufficiently. The ideas of Saint Francis should be implemented because humans tend to have an idea that they are not part of nature or rather superior than nature which is not the case. \\nThe reason why human beings cause environmental degradation is because of the capitalistic regime. Humans in the ancient stages of life lived sustainably were they were part of nature. Nowadays humans maximize the use of natural resources to maximize their profits. That is why nature is exploited, it is a tool to produce and gain a lot of profit which will impact negatively now and in future.\\nHumans now have the obligation to make amends to the natural environment. Already climatic activities have been altered because of the human induced factors now it is up to humans to be part of nature. Humans need to be ethical about the actions that they act on.

A nuclear bomb is a weapon that uses a chemical reaction to release huge amounts of energy in explosive form.{}\\n	Since nuclear weapons were created in the late 1940s, they have been the most destructive manmade weapon on earth. Most modern nuclear bombs weigh around 2400 lb. but can equal the explosive force of millions of tons of TNT.  There are currently thousands of nukes but most of them fall into one of two categories; atomic and thermonuclear. The atomic bomb uses nuclear fission to power its explosion. The thermonuclear uses nuclear fission as well as nuclear fusion to fuel a much larger explosion. Another type of nuclear bomb is the multi-stage thermonuclear bomb, which the range of the explosion is too dangerous to serve purpose or even test. Either way all nuclear weapons use uranium or plutonium to power the blast.{}\\n	The intense range and damage of the nuclear bomb is all due to how it works.  The nuclear bomb obtains this power from a process that can be accurately compared to the domino effect. The process begins when a uranium (or plutonium) atom comes in contact with a neutron; the uranium then splits in two. The two uranium atoms continue to collide with other neutron atoms and splitting over and over again. This process repeats its’ self until there is so much split uranium atoms that the bombs casing bursts. This is called the “splitting the atom” method.{}\\n	The idea of splitting the atom began in 1939 when Albert Einstein wrote a letter to president Roosevelt that the
Microwave transmission refers to the technology of transmitting information or energy by the use of radio waves whose wavelengths are conveniently measured in small numbers of centimeters; these are called microwaves. This part of the radio spectrum ranges across frequencies of roughly 1.0 gigahertz (GHz) to 30 GHz. These correspond to wavelengths from 30 centimeters down to 1.0 cm.\\nMicrowaves are widely used for point-to-point communications because their small wavelength allows conveniently-sized antennas to direct them in narrow beams, which can be pointed directly at the receiving antenna. This allows nearby microwave equipment to use the same frequencies without interfering with each other, as lower frequency radio waves do. Another advantage is that the high frequency of microwaves gives the microwave band a very large information-carrying capacity; the microwave band has a bandwidth 30 times that of all the rest of the radio spectrum below it. A disadvantage is that microwaves are limited to line of sight propagation; they cannot pass around hills or mountains as lower frequency radio waves can.\\nMicrowave radio transmission is commonly used in point-to-point communication systems on the surface of the Earth, in satellite communications, and in deep space radio communications. Other parts of the microwave radio band are used for radars, radio navigation systems, sensor systems, and radio astronomy.\\nThe next higher part of the radio electromagnetic spectrum, where the frequencies are above 30 GHz and below 100 GHz, are called "millimeter waves" because their wavelengths are conveniently measured in millimeters, and their wavelengths range from 10 mm down to 3.0 mm. Radio waves in this band are usually strongly attenuated by the Earthly atmosphere and particles contained in it, especially during wet weather. Also, in wide band of frequencies around 60 GHz, the radio waves are strongly attenuated by molecular oxygen in the atmosphere. The electronic technologies needed in the millimeter wave band are also much more difficult to utilize than those of the microwave band.
Deficitis\\n\\n  Deficitis is a devastating disease where an organ eating parasite called Numotoma eats away at the internal organs until the host dies. The first warning sign of Deficitis is coughing. An infected individual may also suffer from vomiting, diarrhea, uncontrollable bowels, and in the worst cases neck spasms. It is mainly contracted from the common house cat. In order to avoid this disease, your cat must be sprayed with Windex at least 2 times a day. It is the only known chemical able to break down the virus. The Isopropanal found in Windex is what breaks down the genetic structure of Numotoma. Not much is known about Deficitis or the Numotoma parasite associated with it.

An addictive personality refers to a particular set of personality traits that make an individual predisposed to addictions. Addictions are characterized by a physical or psychological dependency that negatively impacts the quality of life of the person. They are frequently connected with substance abuse, but people with addictive personalities are also highly at risk of becoming addicted to gambling, food, exercise, work, and even relationships (codependency) ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). People engaged in addictive behavior tend to plan their lives around it ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). Scientists have been able to better understand addictive personalities as researchers delve further into understanding the chemistry of addiction. Alan R. Lang of Florida State University and author of an addiction study prepared for the National Academy of Sciences said, “If we can better identify the personality factors, they can help us devise better treatment and can open up new strategies to intervene and break the patterns of addiction” (Nelson). \\n\\n==Description==\\nAddictive personality disorder can be defined as a psychological setback that makes people more susceptible to addiction.  This can include anything from drug and alcohol abuse to pornography, gambling, videogames, food, exercise, work and even relations with others.  Experts describe the spectrum of behaviors designated as addictive in terms of five interrelated concepts which include patterns, habits, compulsions, impulse control disorders, and physical addiction ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). An individual is considered to be at the risk of developing such addictions when he/she displays signs of impulsive behavior, nonconformity combined with a weak commitment to the goals for achievement valued by the society, a sense of social alienation, and a sense of heightened stress (Nelson). Such a person may switch from one addiction to another other or even sustain multiple addictions at different times (Mason).\\n\\n==Signs and Symptoms==\\nThe people suffering from addictive personality disorder are currently defined to have a “brain disease” as promoted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and other authorities (Addictive Behaviors 3). People with addictive personalities are very much sensitive to stress. They have trouble handling situations that they deem frustrating, even if the event is for a very short duration. They often lack self-esteem and will show impulsive behavior such as excessive caffeine consumption, eating of chocolates or other sugar laden foods, television watching, or even running (Nelson).\\n\\nMood swings and antisocial behavior are other visible traits of people that suffer from addictive personality disorder. They may turn down invitation to social gatherings in order to alienate themselves from their respective societies.  The main reason behind such behavior is that they are fearful of being caught with this disorder.  The feeling of isolation will often have negative effects on the people that facing the issue, and so to substitute for the lack of personal relationships, they turn towards drugs, smoking, alcohol consumption, or the like.  They usually will believe that such harmful substances serve as “quick-fix" solutions for their life's problems ("Addiction/Addictive Personality").\\n\\nPeople suffering from APD find it difficult to manage their stress levels. In fact, lack of stress tolerance is a telltale sign of the disorder. They find it difficult to face stressful situations and fight hard to get out of such conditions (Mason).\\n\\nLong term goals prove difficult to achieve because people with APD usually focus on the stress that comes with getting through the short term goals.  Such personalities will often switch to other enjoyable activities the moment that they are deprived of enjoyment in their previous addiction.\\n\\nAddictive individuals feel highly insecure when it comes to relationships. They may often find it difficult to make commitments in relationships or trust their beloved because of the difficulty they find in achieving long term goals. They constantly seek approval of others and as a result, and these misunderstandings may contribute to the destruction of relationships.  People suffering from addictive personality disorder usually undergo depression and anxiety, managing their emotions by developing addiction to drugs, alcohol or other pleasurable activities (Nelson).\\n\\n\\n==Common Forms of Addictive Behavior==\\nSubstance abuse and dependence is one of the most common displays of addictive personalities. Alcohol is the most frequently abused psychoactive substance and affects over 20 million Americans—13 percent of the adult population ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). Aside from alcohol, other psychoactive drugs commonly abused include barbiturates, narcotics, stimulants, anti-anxiety drugs, and psychedelics and hallucinogens ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). While drug abuse and dependence can happen to anyone, it is significantly more likely to occur in the presence of an addictive personality. \\n\\nAnother common addiction that may attract those with addictive personalities is gambling. When an addict behaves mindlessly and irresponsibly while gambling, it can grow to be a bigger problem. There are said to be three stages a gambler with an addictive personality goes through (Eng). The first is the “winning phase” in which the person can still control his or her own behavior. Second comes the “losing phase” where the individual starts to gamble alone, borrowing cash and gambling large sums of money compiling debt which he or she may not be able to pay off. Finally, the “desperation phase” of the addictive behavior gambler is when the person takes further risks, may engage in illegal loans and activities and even experience depression or attempt suicide (Eng). \\n\\nAddictive personality behaviors even include eating disorders, such as anorexia, bulimia and compulsive overeating. Those with anorexia nervosa are not content with his or her physical image, and in turn constantly starve him or herself in order to feel beautiful. Once a person starts dieting, it is very difficult for him or her to quit. This is similarly true for those suffering from bulimia. A person is said to have bulimia when he or she binges on large amounts of food and then prevents absorption by purging (laxatives, vomiting, water pills, etc) (Eng). With compulsive eating, the person has a compulsive urge or craving to eat and will eat even when not hungry. This addictive behavior often results in obesity. \\n\\nThree increasingly more common displays of addictive personalities include work and exercise. Our society rewards those who work hard. But work may become an obsession if family, friends, interests and hobbies have suddenly become unimportant. Likewise, an extreme commitment to exercise that can sometimes lead to self destructive and harmful behavior is an example of addictive behavior. \\n\\n==Treatment==\\nAddictive personalities and the subsequent addictions are difficult to treat. Addictive behavior often involves long term psychological ("Addiction/Addictive Personality"). Physical addictions even alter an individual’s brain chemistry making the road to recovery longer and more difficult. Often the person with a physical addiction cannot be exposed to the addictive habit without lapsing back into addiction. This is why rates of being “cured” are often closely followed by setbacks. The first step in the recovery process of addictive behaviors is to admit that there is a problem and seek help. Medical intervention may be necessary for those who engage in substance abuse—medication is often used to treat withdrawal symptoms and treat for malnutrition. Many forms of psychological intervention are also available to those with addictive personalities including counseling and inpatient programs, group therapy, environmental intervention and behavior therapy ("Addiction/Addictive Personality").\\n\\n==References==\\n* "Addiction/Addictive Personality."

Re:  Water Fluoridation Controversy\\n\\nI read Wikipedia's piece Water Fluoridation Controversy, and I browsed a few individual comments concerning the write-up on this topic. Overall I was disappointed, as I found this piece to be very slanted to a pro-fluoridation status quo. I was especially disappointed with the section citing water fluoridation in courts of law, as there was NO MENTIONING of three landmark cases in Illinois, Texas, and Pennsylvania where in two cases water fluoridation was judged as posing a hazard to public health, and in the Illinois case the judge ruled that the Illinois legislature's mandatory fluoridation law was at odds with the scientific evidence, i.e., that fluoridation of water has not been shown to be both safe and effective. The notion that there has been no critical adjudications on water fluoridation is absolutely an outright deception. The fact that these three landmark cases were omitted demonstrates clearly the author's pro-fluoridation bias.\\n\\nWikipedia, you should be able to do better than this.
I am trained in biochemistry at a liberal arts college.  My first and only fluent language is English, although I've taken a major interest in Spanish and also Greek, Latin and maybe even French.  I am also interested in food, music, health, math, computers, physics, systems and informatics, and business and money.  I have never been intrinsically interested in social studies including the broad areas of politics and sociology; I do however try to make concerted efforts to learn within these areas.\\n\\nOn the topic of Wikipedia, I believe this is a powerful and invaluable resource for the world.  I do acknowledge the concerns -- aired mostly by academics -- that open editing compromises the potential accuracy of Wikipedia articles.  However, as long as academics and general users at large understand the value of this online resource as an indicator of the general public's knowledge about included topics, we can better appreciate and use this information concurrent with a healthy skepticism.
As a physicist and chemical engineer, my scientific loyalties sometimes conflict with my spiritual loyalties.   As a philosopher, seeking eternal, universal truths, my discoveries are being chronicled in a book which I call, True Freedom, which finds much resonance with Ayn Rand's Objectivism and Individualism.\\n\\nTrue Freedom requires individual equality, lest one person or group infringe upon the freedoms of others.  Therefore privacy establishes impartiality and fairness.  Privacy protects individuals from inequality by restricting the ability to discern and thus segregate individuals or groups by any particular characteristic.  Security requires that every person be uniquely, positively, and easily identified so that trust may abound and privacy may be most fully preserved.  True Democracy extends equality by allowing every citizen an equal voice in matters of governance (that there may be no masters or tyrants).
Shower science: scientific research or empirical study to discover laws governing the operation and practical use of any showering system being domestic, commercial, military, aerospace, hybrid or other.\\n\\nThe advent of "hybrid showering systems" is rather new. Powerful consumption made possible by a highly automated destruction of vast quantities of hydrocarbons from the Earth, have in a sense over a short time developed a "blind spot" that camouflages the heinous waste of thermal energy, water, and consumables like soap that the contemporary but still extremely primitive bathroom shower system requires to operate.\\n\\nIt was found that only one energy saving hybrid showering system could save energy than a small town where all the lights were on only.\\n\\nThe practical laws that govern "extreme waste" in contemporary showers was first discovered by Michael Vittorio Collalto who in the period during 1986 and particularly from 1994 onwards set about materializing what has become this worlds first "hybrid showering system".\\n\\nIt gradually incorporated a research facility, used to test the hypothesis amongst others that the shower seemed to be no better than an efficient "cooling tower", amazingly adverse to the aim of providing a warm or hot environment.\\n\\nIt mimics the operation of a cooling tower in almost every respect.\\n\\nThe similarities are staggering.\\n\\n(used to cool water in order to improve the efficiency of the refrigeration cycle in larger applications. e.g. commercial buildings.)\\n\\nA technology specifically to remove thermal potential from water efficiently. \\n\\nA further observation has persisted, that according to this discovery, although it might seem desirable to recover heat at the drain from the showering process and others like in the kitchen sink, most of the thermal potential in typical primitive showering systems is removed well before the water reaches the drain where any substantially meaningful recovery can occur.
A large proportion of homes include traditional radiators for heating, which over the years, have been mainly left uncovered, but due to growing demand and the awareness caused by exposure on TV shows, radiator cabinets have changed from an upmarket fashion accessory to an essential item in the home. Providing effective protection against coming into contact with hot surfaces is important for all members of the family, especially the young and elderly. Adding covers eliminates the likelihood of this occurring whilst creating attractive room features throughout the home. An ever increasing selection of cabinets in a variety of styles and finishes is available nationwide in standard sizes to cover the majority of UK radiators and adjustable versions are also available. These are designed to fit a number of different sized radiators by adjusting in width to provide a custom made look. With special made to measure services ensuring non-standard radiators can also be covered, homeowners will welcome the safety and aesthetic benefits of adding radiator cabinet.
\\n== History ==\\n\\nOver the past 20 years, the Dutch Postcode Lottery raised almost 3 billion euros in the Netherlands to support civil society: environmental protection, the conservation of nature, human rights and sustainable development. From the very beginning the lottery supported charitable organisations both international and in the Netherlands by raising money through a lottery and informing the public about the work of the charities concerned. With its 2.5 million participants, the lottery has grown to become the Netherlands’ biggest charity lottery and it supports 75 charitable organisations.\\n\\n== International Scope ==\\n\\nThe Postcode Lottery was also introduced internationally and is now established and successful in Sweden, England and Scotland. The mission of the Postcode Lotteries is to achieve a better world for people and nature; a world in which all people, animals and plants can live healthily, and are treated justly and with respect.\\nThe Postcode Lotteries believe in an entrepreneurial, innovative and creative approach
