Direct carbon conversion units could be used to generate electric power for the grid. Such a power plant would be "large, but not gigantic." Advanced combustion, fuel cells, nuclear and renewable energy, and conservation may all combine to help the situation in a way that cannot presently be predicted.It is vitally important to develop a simple fuel cell technology that greatly increases the yield of electric energy from each unit of fossil fuel, uses fuels derived efficiently from almost any fossil fuel, significantly decreases the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, and makes it easy to capture the carbon dioxide for sequestration or other use.Clearly, we’re just beginning to hear about direct carbon conversion.
Urban Photography is a popular form of photography documenting modern life within any populated geographic location. This form of photography tends to capture everyday life, seemingly from a first-hand account. It can be described as the combination of landscape and documentary photography. While documentary photography is very similar, urban photography generally does not capture a specific event or cause. Typical works of urban photography will feature city skylines, city-life, buildings, cars and people. This form of photography is especially popular among bloggers and amateur photographers.
We envision a resilient and independently sustainable Prince Rupert, capable of providing for itself comfortably through both times of economic boom or bust.

Management in all business and organizational activities is the act of getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives using available resources efficiently and effectively. Management comprises planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization (a group of one or more people or entities) or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal. Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources and natural resources.\\nSince organizations can be viewed as systems, management can also be defined as human action, including design, to facilitate the production of useful outcomes from a system. This view opens the opportunity to 'manage' oneself, a pre-requisite to attempting to manage others.

\\n \\nGraphical description of risks and impacts from global warming from the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\nThe predicted effects of global warming on the environment and for human life are numerous and varied. It is generally difficult to attribute specific natural phenomena to long-term causes, but some effects of recent climate change may already be occurring. Raising sea levels, glacier retreat, Arctic shrinkage, and altered patterns of agriculture are cited as direct consequences, but predictions for secondary and regional effects include extreme weather events, an expansion of tropical diseases, changes in the timing of seasonal patterns in ecosystems, and drastic economic impact. Concerns have led to political activism advocating proposals to mitigate, eliminate, or adapt to it.\\nThe 2007 Fourth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) includes a summary of the expected effects.\\n\\n Global warming is responsible in part for some trends in natural disasters such as extreme weather\\n\\nLewis Glacier, North Cascades, WA USA is one of five glaciers in the area that melted away \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\nRetreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland

Can you help translate this for me to swedish? Many thanks in advance!\\n\\n''The communist government allocated substantial resources to the development of agriculture. Large-scale programs of land reclamation, soil improvement, and irrigation, as well as increased use of fertilizers, all contributed to a significant expansion of agricultural production. Yet, despite impressive gains, agricultural production continues to be hindered by the persistence of traditional farming methods, low mechanization, and a lack of material incentives to encourage farmers to produce. This lasting legacy of the forced collectivization of agriculture and the abolition of private property has made it necessary to return land to the peasants and allow them to raise crops and livestock for private profit.

                                          Rocks And Minerals\\n\\nWhat are rocks?\\n\\nMaking up the majority of the Earth's crust, rock is usually defined as a mixture of common minerals. Rocks can be hard or soft, as small as a grain or as large as a building. They have been an integral part of the history of mankind, first being used as tools for hunting and defense, and as a building materials to construct shelters and monuments. Combined with the effects of tectonics, weathering and vegetation, rocks define the natural landscapes we see around us. The minerals and metals we find in rocks are essential to the prosperity and cultural splendor of human civilization. There are many kinds of rock, and they can be classified in a number of ways. However, geologists classify rocks based on how the rocks were formed. The three classes are igneous rocks (formed directly from liquid rock), metamorphic rocks (formed by direct alteration of existing rocks), and sedimentary rocks (formed by eroded materials from other rocks).

\\n\\n'''Sick River Syndrome'''\\nSick River Syndrome is the stress placed on rivers and communities when human activity deteriorates the river water quality.\\nOver extraction of water for drinking and irrigation can slow or stop the current. The reduced flow helps cause salinity and stagnation. Flood plain wetlands dry up. River estuaries can become blocked preventing tidal waters entering coastal wetlands affecting marine life, water birds and mangroves.\\nMining waste, animal waste, agricultural chemicals [fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and insecticides], sewerage and urban storm water can all flow in and pollute rivers\\nCommunities reliant on the river for drinking water, irrigation, fishing and recreation are faced with an unsustainable future. Arguements and blame are cast between users, environmentalists and governments.\\n''Examples\\nThe Anglesea River in Victoria Australia. When dead fish were found floating in the river some residents blamed the near by coal mine, others blamed herbicide spraying up stream. What ever the cause, both the river and the community were stressed.\\nThe Murray Darling River System in Australia is a major example of Sick River Syndrome exasperated by an extended drought in the early 21st century.

Deficitis\\n\\n  Deficitis is a devastating disease where an organ eating parasite called Numotoma eats away at the internal organs until the host dies. The first warning sign of Deficitis is coughing. An infected individual may also suffer from vomiting, diarrhea, uncontrollable bowels, and in the worst cases neck spasms. It is mainly contracted from the common house cat. In order to avoid this disease, your cat must be sprayed with Windex at least 2 times a day. It is the only known chemical able to break down the virus. The Isopropanal found in Windex is what breaks down the genetic structure of Numotoma. Not much is known about Deficitis or the Numotoma parasite associated with it.

#REDIRECT [[Human capital]]\\nHuman capital is defined as comprising the knowledge, skills, competencies and attributes embodied in individuals that facilitate the creation of personal, social and economic wellbeing (Healy and Côté, 2001). Human Capital Theory states that the knowledge, experience and skills of employees are developed through processes of advanced education, training and development and job changes (Tharenou, 1997). Human capital acquisition through learning and job satisfaction increases the ability of a workforce to perform effectively (Michael et al., 2000; Shaw et al., 2005; Tomer, 1998). Thus, nurturing human capital is fundamental to the successful placement of manpower in private sector jobs.

Viral Influenza Shedding:  It appears that reliable information about viral shedding of Influenza A in general and the current H1N1 "Swine Flu" epidemic is not readily available. In order to rationally recommend quarantine of affected individuals in schools, work sites or other closed communities, it is necessary to know the rate at which affected individuals become less contagious to others. This page is intended to attract commentary from knowledgeable contributors about how rapidly  H1N1 infected individuals can be returned to their communities without unduly risking their colleagues. Although current public health policy recommends isolation from 5 to 10 days after the apparent onset of illness, the scientific basis for this recommendation seems obscure beyond experiments involving artificial viral infection with vaccination strains.

Alison Firich\\n Salt Wedging\\n1.	The type of weathering is salt wedging.  Salt wedging occurs in arid climates and coastal areas.  It occurs when saline or salt gets into cracks of the rocks, evaporates, and leaves crystals of salt behind.  The rock disintegrates or expands due to the saline solution’s effects.\\n2.	The rate of weathering is affected by the freshwater runoff in the particular area.  If there is no runoff of freshwater, then the salt water will be more diluted.  \\n3.	Salt wedging can be expected to be found in coastal regions near ocean (salt) waters!
Despite the wealth of development knowledge, experience, and tools available today, a substantial percentage of software projects fail, often because requirements are not correctly determined and defined at the outset, or are not managed correctly as the project unfolds. To ease the managing software requirements, collaboration between developers and the stakeholder are the key factors for the success of any given project. With the help of collaborating systems such as Wiki System, complexity of the managing development keeps low and effective. This paper examines how Wiki System improves the quality of Managing Software Requirements.

== Climatically stable rain forest ==\\n\\nTropical lowland rain forest is highly dependent on sufficient rainfall evently distributed over the year, i.e. without a significant dry season. A critical drop in rainfall or lengthing of the dry season will cause the forest to change, gradually or dramatically depending on the severity of the change (the latter often associated with humain induced fires). A gradual change in climate causes humid rain forest to become monsoon or decidious forest and eventually it will be replaced by shrub and grassland. A dramatic change is ussually caused by fire when the dried out rain forest burns and the closed-canopy rain forest is reduced to a forest savanna mosaic(e.g. during El Nino events in Indonesia). \\n\\nThe amount and annual distribution of rainfall at the equator has varied regularly due to natural causes related to orbital forcing, continental drift and most recently due to humain socio-economic development. During periods with a drier climatic regime some of the rain forest would disapear first at the edge and progressively inward.
