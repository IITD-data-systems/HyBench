Air pollution is the introduction of chemicals, particulate matter, or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to humans or other living organisms, or cause damage to the natural environment or built environment, into the atmosphere.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is a complex dynamic natural gaseous system that is essential to support life on planet Earth. Stratospheric ozone depletion due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the Earth's ecosystems.\\n\\nIndoor air pollution and urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report.[1]{{User sandbox}}\\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->
Direct carbon conversion units could be used to generate electric power for the grid. Such a power plant would be "large, but not gigantic." Advanced combustion, fuel cells, nuclear and renewable energy, and conservation may all combine to help the situation in a way that cannot presently be predicted.It is vitally important to develop a simple fuel cell technology that greatly increases the yield of electric energy from each unit of fossil fuel, uses fuels derived efficiently from almost any fossil fuel, significantly decreases the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, and makes it easy to capture the carbon dioxide for sequestration or other use.Clearly, we’re just beginning to hear about direct carbon conversion.
Urban Photography is a popular form of photography documenting modern life within any populated geographic location. This form of photography tends to capture everyday life, seemingly from a first-hand account. It can be described as the combination of landscape and documentary photography. While documentary photography is very similar, urban photography generally does not capture a specific event or cause. Typical works of urban photography will feature city skylines, city-life, buildings, cars and people. This form of photography is especially popular among bloggers and amateur photographers.
We envision a resilient and independently sustainable Prince Rupert, capable of providing for itself comfortably through both times of economic boom or bust. A community where food and energy are produced locally, where waste is reduced and reclaimed for productive use. A community that values the unique contributions and skills of its citizens, where human development is a top priority and using less fossil fuels results in greater overall community well-being. We dare to dream of a Prince Rupert where imagination, creativity, fun and play unlock the collective genius within our community.
\\nThe ACP is a professional body who supports and develops a community of professionals with the aim of facilitating the transition to a low carbon economy. \\nThe carbon professionals are: carbon managers, carbon traders and analysts, energy managers, facilities managers, climate change policy makers, carbon management students and academic or professional researchers. They work on reducing carbon emissions either directly, or indirectly through offsets and energy and carbon markets. \\nACP is also raising awareness of and supporting the establishment of recognised professional accreditation programmes for GHG measurement and verification.
Management in all business and organizational activities is the act of getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives using available resources efficiently and effectively. Management comprises planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization (a group of one or more people or entities) or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal. Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources and natural resources.\\nSince organizations can be viewed as systems, management can also be defined as human action, including design, to facilitate the production of useful outcomes from a system. This view opens the opportunity to 'manage' oneself, a pre-requisite to attempting to manage others.

Inboxication is the overwhelming feeling and resulting stress associated with the challenge of keeping up with all the information from our inboxes and the all too common addiction to these inboxes. Studies have shown that constant interruptions caused by the bleeps of our mobile phones and email systems are causing Constant Partial Attention (CPA). The increase in the number of emails recieved daily combined with the multitude of communications channels such as SMS, IM and social networking mediums is increasing the impact of Data Smog and resulting in more Information Fatigue Syndrome. More and more people are exhibiting signs of Attention Deficit Trait(ADT) as they struggle to maintain focus and reduce stress.
== Baby Proofing ==\\nA process which involves creating a safe place for babies and children to exist, play and live that will limit the exposure to potentially dangerous items, situations and conditions to prevent injury, damage and death. The process often includes the addition and use of devices to assist in the process. A home or space used for babies and children should be enhanced for their safety prior to the time they are able to crawl or become mobile. Common items that are utilized to increase safety include - stairwell gates, drawer and cabinet locks, electrical outlet protection, bathroom and toilet locks, stabilizng or anchoring furniture to prevent toppling, fire safety equipment and emergency planning tools.
