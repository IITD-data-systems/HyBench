\\n \\nGraphical description of risks and impacts from global warming from the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\nThe predicted effects of global warming on the environment and for human life are numerous and varied. It is generally difficult to attribute specific natural phenomena to long-term causes, but some effects of recent climate change may already be occurring. Raising sea levels, glacier retreat, Arctic shrinkage, and altered patterns of agriculture are cited as direct consequences, but predictions for secondary and regional effects include extreme weather events, an expansion of tropical diseases, changes in the timing of seasonal patterns in ecosystems, and drastic economic impact. Concerns have led to political activism advocating proposals to mitigate, eliminate, or adapt to it.\\nThe 2007 Fourth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) includes a summary of the expected effects.\\n\\n Global warming is responsible in part for some trends in natural disasters such as extreme weather\\n\\nLewis Glacier, North Cascades, WA USA is one of five glaciers in the area that melted away \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\nRetreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland
Less Law, More Order:  The Truth about Reducing Crime proposes a federal crime bill to reduce crime, reduce taxes and invest in youth, families and neighborhoods.  Each year 24 million Americans are victims of crime. U.S. taxpayers spend more and more each year on police, prisons and judges--a record $200 billion at last count. Yet prestigious commissions show not only that this standard way of responding to crime is ineffective but that there is scientific proof that many projects that tackle risk factors that cause crime are effective. Less Law, More Order illustrates in convincing detail what needs to be done to prevent crime.  It shows that hiring public health nurses and investing in helping youth at risk to complete school and get job training is better than hiring more police; preventing family violence, banning hand guns and dealing with drugs through public health saves more lives than incarceration; getting close neighbors to watch out for us and better industrial design are more effective than criminal courts; smarter policing is better than more police; paying for services to support victims and guaranteeing them rights is better than more rhetoric. Addressing the social issues that lead to crime, rather than addressing crime after it happens, or putting stiffer penalties in place, will contribute to creating a safer society and to keeping kids and adults from taking the wrong path toward a life of crime.
The mission of the INDC is to increase our understanding of the effects of common food on long term health, performance, mental and physical fitness.\\n\\nTo achieve this goal, we need to gain insight into bioactive compounds in food, how they are absorbed and metabolized in the body, taking into account the genetic and metabolic uniqueness of individuals. \\n\\nThis requires very sensitive analytical methods to determine what we really eat. The same instrumentation can be used to control quality and content of food and to analyze metabolites and nutritional biomarkers.\\n\\nWe do not eat the same bread or drink the same beer that our grandparents did hundred years ago. Agriculture and food technology have changed greatly and must be taken into account to evaluate the effect of these technologies on the nutritional value of food and its effect on human health.\\n\\nWe also have to consider the health effect of our life style; one of sitting in front of the computer, in a car or on an airplane. Our body evolved to produce chemicals to help us to survive but with an active lifestyle. The result is that, we now live in a new state of physiological stress. \\n\\nMeaningful food recommendations based on such understanding is limited. It is critical to understand what to eat and how these foods are metabolized and what molecules are produced in the human body as a reaction to stress.\\n\\nIt is the goal of INDC to bring together an understanding of the food we eat with the analytical techniques needed to study them.\\n\\nINDC2012 will be held at Carolinum, Charles University in Prague, August 27-30, 2012. \\n\\nReferences:http://www.indc.cz/en/
In business, reducing operations to the bare minimum required to continue serving existing business; colloquially, the least necessary to 'keep the lights on'. It emphasizes only those functions needed to continue serving the firm's customers and slows/halts/cancels all other operations (research, development, hiring, promotions and non-salary compensation, capital improvements, etc.)\\n\\nDuring bad economic times, the progression of operations to a lights-on mode typically takes place over several weeks or months of cutbacks, project cancellations and layoffs. \\n\\nThe term also applies to much faster-developing situations, such as a disaster, pandemic or other event that renders large portions of the workforce or infrastructure unable to function. \\n\\nAt larger firms, this mode is part of formal Operational Plan under a variety of names ('Run the Firm', 'Reduced-overhead', etc.)  The Plan is used as a tool to catgeorize projects, assets and infrastructure as part of normal operations. While this is usually to help plan for rapid-onset crises, the same designations eventually apply to a slow-moving economic downturn. \\n\\nSmaller firms usually do not have such formal plans, instead relying on management to designate key people and projects.
What are Prayer Wheels?\\n\\n   Prayer wheels contain the words of the Buddha: teachings of wisdom and compassion. While the Buddha's discourses fill many volumes, they may also be condensed into syllables with deep symbolic meaning known as mantra. Tibetans recite these profound and inspiring texts to instill them in memory and promote the well­being of others. \\n\\n   The Tibetan term "dharma wheel" has been rendered into English as "prayer wheel". Yet prayer wheels are much more than supplicants to a higher spirit. They can contain the full potency and meaning of the path to enlightenment.\\n\\n   Believing that turning dharma wheels filled with these texts and symbols is equivalent to reciting them, Tibetans place dharma wheels in monasteries, temples, and libraries and turn them at every opportunity to convey the blessings of compassion and harmony, prevent natural disasters, and promote peace in the world. Although dharma wheels were known in ancient India and Nepal, only in Tibet did they become an integral part of daily life. Today as in ages past, the dharma wheels are honored as symbols of enlightened knowledge, able to evoke the healing powers of the mind and increase its capacities for wisdom.\\n\\n   In recent years, the world has seen how quickly knowledge-even when valued and protected by an entire culture-can be brought to the brink of extinction. In response, we have made great efforts to preserve the cultural heritage of Tibet, including the intricate science of dharma wheels, which are in themselves ways of preserving and disseminating the benefits of enlightened knowledge. Having created more than a thousand 4 foot high wheels for our own organization and donated 100,000 of the hand-held wheels to individuals in the Himalayan region, we have come to share the view that dharma wheels have a calming and healing influence on the environment and human beings, qualities greatly needed in our world today.
'''Groundwork'''\\n\\nEstablished in 1981, Groundwork is a voluntary environmental organisation, dedicated to the preservation of some of Ireland's most precious habitats: the oak woodlands in Killarney National Park, Co. Kerry.\\n\\nMost of Groundwork’s focus has been on the removal of the invasive Rhododendron ponticum from Killarney National Park.\\n\\nThe unique ecology of the Killarney oak woodlands is seriously threatened by the invasion of Rhododendron ponticum. This non-native shrub thrives in the mild and moist conditions in Killarney and can spread rapidly especially where soils are acidic. Within 25 years rhododendron can form impenetrable thickets with plants up to six metres in height. These thickets cast such a dense shade that almost nothing can grow beneath them. This prevents the regeneration of the oakwoods.\\n\\nDuring the last 27 years Groundwork has changed from a small group of environmentally-concerned Irish students to an organisation attracting conservation-minded people from all over the world to carry out voluntary work in one of Ireland's most beautiful natural landscapes.\\n\\nSee http://www.groundwork.ie
A Conjoined Wealth Fund (CWF) is a relatively small privately-owned investment fund or group of funds composed of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, property, precious metals or other financial instruments. Conjoined wealth funds invest funds globally to take advantage of the global growth and opportunities; however, they keep a strict domestic reinvestment mission in order to subsidize depleted governmental revenues. \\n\\nSome conjoined wealth funds are held solely by a non-profit or faith based organization, who accumulate the funds in the course of their management existing missions and donor initiatives of a small community; this type of fund is usually of major economic and fiscal importance to the region. Other conjoined wealth funds are simply the savings small for-profit businesses that depend heavily on a local community, invested by various entities for the purposes of investment return, and which may not have significant role in fiscal management.\\n\\nThe accumulated funds are used to prop up local communities too dense to receive the highest quality of goods and services a sovereign nation has to offer, as well as sparse communities that present obvious and long standing tax anomalies. While conjoined wealth funds engage the global equity markets, their core investment focus is assisting the state to create self sufficient communities and cities.
The purpose of this policy, known as the “Canary Initiative” is to drastically reduce Aspen’s carbon footprint. Because of Aspen’s high-end reputation, the carbon level this city emits is significantly higher than a similar-sized city. The initiative received its name from the idea that Aspen’s climate is a “canary in a coal mine”; that is, Aspen's climate could be significantly altered by events and changes from outside areas. Aspen is a popular resort destination for its ski mountains, and tourism is a key component in the business Aspen receives. However, with rising global temperatures, Aspen’s snow is estimated to disappear entirely by 2100. In order to prevent irreversible damage to the natural environment, while sustaining and developing Aspen's economy, this city-wide initiative was created. The initiative calls for: a greenhouse gas emissions inventory, an assessment of impacts of global and local climate change, an education and action plan for advocacy on regional, state, and national levels. \\n\\n'''Aspen’s 2000 IPCC Report'''\\n\\nIn 2000, the city of Aspen and the Aspen Skiing Company launched a study of the effects of rising temperatures on Aspen and the surrounding mountains. Using state-of the art climate prediction models, as well as unique physical and geographical data for Aspen, the report illustrated the consequences of various actions of humankind. The following data is from the results of the study. In the low emissions scenario (global greenhouse gas levels peak at or around 500 ppm), Aspen was expected to experience about 6 degrees F of warming by 2100, giving Aspen a climate more similar to Los Alamos, New Mexico. Under the “business as usual” scenario, GHG levels would peak around 700 ppm, and Aspen would experience 14 degrees F of warming by 2100, giving it a climate more like Amarillo, Texas. In both of these scenarios, Aspen’s snowpack is dramatically reduced; in the “business-as-usual” scenario the snowpack is virtually non-existent by 2100. Because of the alarming results of the IPCC report, Aspen and the Aspen Skiing Company quickly mobilized to clean up—their business depends on it. Several adverse effects on the spring runoff and ecosystems of Aspen were also mentioned, most notably the peak spring discharge occurring earlier in the year, and an increase of summer droughts. \\n\\n'''Greenhouse Gas Reductions'''\\n\\nIn 2005, the City of Aspen made and signed a legally-binding contract to reduce its GHG emissions by at least 1% every year. By the end of 2006 Aspen had reduced its emissions by 11.5%, and new, more stringent community reduction goals were made. The Canary Initiative requires GHG emissions to be cut by 30% (from 2004 levels) by 2020, and 80% reduction by mid-century.\\n\\n'''Canary Action Plan'''\\n\\nThe Canary Action Plan details the emission cuts or general improvements that need to be made in several sectors of business. Sectors include: policy, research, and education; energy efficient buildings; ground and air transportation, electricity (higher percentage of renewable), landfill waste reduction/recycling programs, and finally carbon credits to offset extra GHG produced.\\n\\n''Policy, Research, and Education:''\\n•	Ensure that education and policy decisions at all levels – government, business, and individual – seek to significantly reduce GHG emissions\\n•	Provide education, in a variety of venues, and data needed by the community to understand the need for action to reduce global warming\\n\\n''Buildings: Energy Efficiency:''\\n•	Reduce GHG’s 20% below 2004 levels in all City of Aspen facilities by 2009\\n•	Require all new construction (commercial and residential) to be 50% more energy efficient than the International Energy Conservation Code by 2009.\\n•	Encourage and incentivize existing buildings (commercial and residential) to reduce GHG emissions 20% below 2004 levels by 2009\\n\\n''Air and Ground Transportation''\\n•	Reduce the volume of single occupancy traffic into Aspen and around town.\\n•	Create a mass transit-oriented transportation alternative into Aspen that is more convenient and affordable and has lower GHG emissions per passenger mile than the average private vehicle.\\n•	Increase the use of highly fuel-efficient and low emissions fuel engines and machinery in on-road and off-road vehicles.\\n•	Require that all new development projects have a net decrease in transportation related emissions compared to existing development conditions\\n•	Reduce emissions from air travel\\n\\n''Electricity:'' Generate and/or purchase 45% of Aspen’s electricity from renewable resources by 2012.\\n\\n''Landfill:'' Waste Reduction and Recycling\\n•	Increase the overall solid waste recycling rate by 20% over the 2006 baseline by 2009.\\n•	Decrease the amount of solid waste generated\\n\\n''Localization'': Carbon Offsets, Food, and Other\\n•	Provide a reliable and effective option to offset GHG emissions\\n•	Educate City staff and the community on the global warming impacts of the industrialized food supply chain and encourage the cultivation and purchase of locally produced foods\\n\\n<reference>http://aspenpitkin.com/Living-in-the-Valley/Green-Initiatives/Canary-Initiative/\\n<reference/>
== Ongoing Challenges ==\\nUtopia presents a fascinating instance of the set of problems, challenges and achievements that are entailed in the long search for a just integration of remote indigenous people into the Australian community. Its 30 year history is a record of 'self-determination' on a background of well developed communal will, strong participation, and an experience during the era of settlement which included some profitable relations with white pastoralists and some degree of continuous occupation. It's success, in mitigating the clinical disorders associated with transition to sedentary life, and minimising the advent of destructive behaviours and intoxicants; in maintaining a strong commitment to traditional practices and customs, and the ever present interest in the issue of identity in the face of coercive change, are impressive. Even so, the future of Utopia and places like it is problematic; the notion of integration itself the subject of contention; self determination is only effective inside a sphere of dependency that brings with it a plethora of social and political consequences. To many observers, the outstanding deficiency in remote communities is education, which provides its beneficiaries with capacities for choosing the terms of their own integration. It is of course, also a powerful integrative force itself, and so shifts the issue of cultural identity. The tensions due to these inevitable dilemmas are present at Utopia. The community is however in an unusually good position to resolve them, given time and a sympathetic administration.
'''Taiko Fujimura''' is a mixed media artist based in San Francisco. Working with wood, paints, plexiglas, mirrors and found objects, she creates conceptual two- and three-dimensional collage and assemblage works as well as paintings on wood, canvas, rice paper, and several types of archival papers. Her three-dimensional work is designed to invite the viewer to interact with each piece to discover his or her personal aesthetic within the microcosm of what Taiko presents as the broader representation of beauty.\\n\\nTaiko selects materials that link her inner self with the outside world, creating an extended montage of her personal experiences, connections and relationships with both people and objects. Her pieces confront the dichotomies between chaos and order, industrial and organic, mind and body, positive and negative, logical and random, and intuitive and sequential. She feels an understanding of dualism is key to her art. Her pieces seek to bridge the contradictions around us by unifying space.\\n\\nThe concepts she explores include quietude, peacefulness, harmony, unity, and universality. Her work is strongly influenced by Japanese wabi-sabi, an aesthetic system she strongly believes to be "beautiful" art and Japanese calligraphy, which she studied since age six. Her works appear in over 100 private and public collections globally.
