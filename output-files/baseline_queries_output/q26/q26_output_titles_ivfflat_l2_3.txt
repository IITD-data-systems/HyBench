\\n \\nGraphical description of risks and impacts from global warming from the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\nThe predicted effects of global warming on the environment and for human life are numerous and varied. It is generally difficult to attribute specific natural phenomena to long-term causes, but some effects of recent climate change may already be occurring. Raising sea levels, glacier retreat, Arctic shrinkage, and altered patterns of agriculture are cited as direct consequences, but predictions for secondary and regional effects include extreme weather events, an expansion of tropical diseases, changes in the timing of seasonal patterns in ecosystems, and drastic economic impact. Concerns have led to political activism advocating proposals to mitigate, eliminate, or adapt to it.\\nThe 2007 Fourth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) includes a summary of the expected effects.\\n\\n Global warming is responsible in part for some trends in natural disasters such as extreme weather\\n\\nLewis Glacier, North Cascades, WA USA is one of five glaciers in the area that melted away \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\nRetreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland
Less Law, More Order:  The Truth about Reducing Crime proposes a federal crime bill to reduce crime, reduce taxes and invest in youth, families and neighborhoods.  Each year 24 million Americans are victims of crime. U.S. taxpayers spend more and more each year on police, prisons and judges--a record $200 billion at last count. Yet prestigious commissions show not only that this standard way of responding to crime is ineffective but that there is scientific proof that many projects that tackle risk factors that cause crime are effective. Less Law, More Order illustrates in convincing detail what needs to be done to prevent crime.  It shows that hiring public health nurses and investing in helping youth at risk to complete school and get job training is better than hiring more police; preventing family violence, banning hand guns and dealing with drugs through public health saves more lives than incarceration; getting close neighbors to watch out for us and better industrial design are more effective than criminal courts; smarter policing is better than more police; paying for services to support victims and guaranteeing them rights is better than more rhetoric. Addressing the social issues that lead to crime, rather than addressing crime after it happens, or putting stiffer penalties in place, will contribute to creating a safer society and to keeping kids and adults from taking the wrong path toward a life of crime.
Meet the evolution of plastic pollution… PlasTikobots! As many of us who live near the oceans, or any body of water for that matter, know that plastic products are one of the top forms of pollution found in those areas. All of these PlasTikobots are made from that very same plastic pollution. According to the California Coastal Commission approximately 1,224,663 tons of debris was collected during California Coastal Cleanup day in 2010; a large amount of which was plastic. This debris can be harmful to many plant and animal species that live in these aquatic ecosystems. They can swallow the plastic pieces which they aren’t able to digest, or it could even choke them. In addition, the chemical compounds in the plastic can leach out into the water changing its chemistry and introducing harmful toxins. When you look closely you can actually begin to make out the different types of plastic that constitute the PlasTikobots. Each one is made from plastic products collected from a beach or near a waterway. We have made them in order to call attention to the increasing problem of plastic, and other pollution in these delicate and vital ecosystems. "PlasTikobots were created and designed by Southern California Artist, Claudio Garzon"
     There has been extensive coverage of Martin Luther King, Jr's troubles with the FBI.  As Donner's book "The Age of Surveillance" points out many other individuals and groups, integrationist and segregationist, were targeted by the FBI and other intelligence agencies.  Those targeted were subject to "agressive" intelligence.  That is actions to hinder or harm the organizations and individuals.  Such activity was so widespread that it appears to represent an official, but clandestine, policy.  This raises the possibility that the federal government or some part thereof had decided racial agitation during the Cold War could be an intolerable threat to national security.  Attempting to control racial agitation by legal action might actually increase racial animosities so clandestine action was required.  In view of the extent of this suppression of lower level racial agitators it was probably felt essential to "neutralize" Dr. King.  The same possibility occurs in the case of George Wallace.\\n     In both cases these assassinations or attempts were investigated by the federal government which may have been a party to them.  This raises more unanswered questions about these events.

The results indicate that trauma is caused by the consequence of young people becoming homeless, and the lives of these men and women should be understood. Other causes for homelessness are issues from people living in poverty, lack of employment, houses being too expensive, gentrification and violence. All of these reasons is why people are now becoming homeless at young ages. \\n\\nYoung children are becoming homeless as well. There are major risks for homeless children, such as poor health care, not having a good well-being and having bad social outcomes. These children are exposed to a very stressful life style, they witness a lot of domestic violence, mental health difficulties and most likely to come from a broken home. In about every 200 children in America, 3 will become homeless today and more then double of that will be at risk for homelessness. School is impacted by homelessness, because of residency requirements, guardianship requirements, delays in transfer of school credits, use of transportation and lack of health resources. Even the children who still attend school that are homeless, have a low attendance record.\\n\\nThere have been alliances that organizations have created to end homelessness. There are studies and estimations that have been made to figure out how many individuals today are homeless. There are strategies that are listed about how to end it and ways to gain more knowledge on the topic as well.
12forests, was founded in Chicago, IL, in 2008. The focus of the organization is  to help the world end exploitation and its causes. It uses proven vedic and yogic methodologies, to distribute karma free vegetarian food, educate and develop sustainable villages. Its outlook is always wide, focusing on how the world views the environment and all living beings.  Understanding the importance of clean and safe environment it introduces everyone to proven strategies of simple development based on cows and land.  12forests which comes from an extensive research background on the importance of cows, as seen in ayurveda and yoga.  The dung and urine of the cow provides for an antiseptic environment which would help third world countries counteract the threats of unsanitary conditions.  Also, it helps to set aside petroleum based and human feces fertilizers as used in the USA and Mexico.  These fertilizers have caused countless deaths in the form of e.coli and cancers, and not to speak of destroying water supplies.  So based on the highest scientific models 12forests is helping poverty stricken children, families and the environment from forced degradation.\\n<ref>12forests.org</ref>
My report on Thoroughbreds so far:\\n\\nThoroughbreds have a well-chiseled head. Thoroughbreds are considered a hot-blooded horse because of their agility, speed, and spirit.\\n\\nThe thoroughbred that is known today was developed in the 17th and the 18th century, which was 1600 and 1700. All modern Thoroughbreds can find their pedigrees to three stallions originally transported into England in the 1600s and 1700s. During the 1800s and the 1700s, the Thoroughbred breed went around the world. Many thoroughbreds exist worldwide today ,with over 118,000 people registered each year worldwide.   \\n\\nThoroughbreds are usually used for racing but also bred for other riding disciplines, such as show jumping, combined training, and more. They are also cross-bred with other breeds to create new breeds or improve existing breeds.\\n\\nThoroughbred racehorses perform with maximum effort, which has resulted on high rates of accidents and other health problems. Also, thoroughbreds are prone to other health problems, including bleeding from the lungs, small hearts, and more. There are several theories for the reasons behind the frequency of accidents and health problems in the  thoroughbred breed, and research continues into how to reduce the accident rate and treat those animals that are injured.\\n\\nThoroughbreds are most often bay, seal brown, chestnut, black, or gray. The less common colors that are recognized in the United States are roan, palomino, and more. White is not seen that much, but it is also known color separate from the gray.
Technology is the making, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The word technology comes from Greek τεχνολογία (technología); from τέχνη (téchnē), meaning "art, skill, craft", and -λογία (-logía), meaning "study of-".[1] The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include construction technology, medical technology, and information technology.\\nThe human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.\\nTechnology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of the Earth and its environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.\\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.

B.G. Burkett, however, ignores the statistics of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Almost all legitimate sources state that a significant number of Vietnam combat veterans suffer from some degree of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Perhaps the most recent and most accurate of the study of these veterans, their pyschological disorders and consequences are described in Dr. Jonathans Shay's two highly accalimed books "Achilles in Vietnam" and "Odysseus in America." The treatment of Vietnam Veterans by both pro and anti-war groups, and the population in general, upon their return to America and the cultural milieu into which they re-entered caused a host of profound complex and often debilitating consequences for these veterans. Many of these veterans, almost forty years later, still carry the weight of these disorders and do not fully participate in the mainstream of American society. Rather they remain as "outliers" unable to comprehend why American society has rejected them.
