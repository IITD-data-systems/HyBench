Nanotechnology (sometimes shortened to "nano tech") is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale. Generally, nanotechnology works with materials, devices, and other structures with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. Quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale. With a variety of potential applications, nanotechnology is a key technology for the future and governments have invested billions of dollars in its research. Through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars. The European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars.[1]\\n\\nNanotechnology is very diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale. Nanotechnology entails the application of fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, micro fabrication, etc.\\n\\nScientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in medicine, electronics, bio materials and energy production. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nano-materials,[2] and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.
By Martin F. Downs\\n\\n           In November 2004, a panel of experts testified before a Senate subcommittee that a pornographic products which millions of Americans consume is dangerously addictive. They were talking about pornography.The effects of porn on the brain were called "toxic" and compared to cocaine. One psychologist, Geryy Magera claimed "prolonged exposure to pornography stimulates a preference for depictions of group sex, sadomasochistic practices, and sexual contact with animals." His respondents were 100 American males.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendation:\\nI believe that there are legal measures that can and should be put into place that can significantly reduce the harm done to individuals during the production of pornography. (And as a result of what happened during that production.) These measures can also reduce the harm done to women, children, and society in general from the existence of, consumption of, and influence of violent, degrading, and sexist pornography. Such measures would include: restricting access of Internet pornography and other types of pornography to those who are 18 and over, raising the age of participation in pornography to 21 years old, and improving the health and safety standards of pornography production in a variety of ways, including implementing mandatory condom use.
== Climatically stable rain forest ==\\n\\nTropical lowland rain forest is highly dependent on sufficient rainfall evently distributed over the year, i.e. without a significant dry season. A critical drop in rainfall or lengthing of the dry season will cause the forest to change, gradually or dramatically depending on the severity of the change (the latter often associated with humain induced fires). A gradual change in climate causes humid rain forest to become monsoon or decidious forest and eventually it will be replaced by shrub and grassland. A dramatic change is ussually caused by fire when the dried out rain forest burns and the closed-canopy rain forest is reduced to a forest savanna mosaic(e.g. during El Nino events in Indonesia). \\n\\nThe amount and annual distribution of rainfall at the equator has varied regularly due to natural causes related to orbital forcing, continental drift and most recently due to humain socio-economic development. During periods with a drier climatic regime some of the rain forest would disapear first at the edge and progressively inward.
There is no simple interpretation of what constitutes a "genetic disorder", since most aspects of human biology involve both genetic (inherited) and non-genetic (environmental) causes. Moreover, many genetic effects influence aspects of our biology that are not specifically medical in nature (height, eye color, ability to taste or smell certain compounds, etc). Also, some genetic disorders only yield a medical condition in combination with the relevant environmental factors (such as diet). With these caveats, genetic disorders typically consist of clinically defined diseases with a clearly demonstrable genetic cause. Ideally, the disorder can be associated with DNA sequence variation in a single gene. For example, cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, and is the most common recessive disorder in caucasian populations with over 1300 different mutations known[1]. Severe mutations in specific genes are relatively rare, thus genetic disorders are similarly individually rare. However, since there are many genes that can vary to cause genetic disorders, in aggregate they comprise a significant component of medical conditions, especially in pediatrics. Molecularly characterized genetic disorders are those for which the underlying causal gene has been identified, currently there are approximately 2100 such disorders annotated in the OMIM database
'''Globalization of Markets and Competition: Trade is increasingly global in scope today. There are several reasons for this. One significant reason is technological—because of improved transportation and communication opportunities today, trade is now more practical. Thus, consumers and businesses now have access to the very best products from many different countries. Increasingly rapid technology lifecycles also increases the competition among countries as to who can produce the newest in technology. In part to accommodate these realities, countries in the last several decades have taken increasing steps to promote global trade through agreements such as the General Treaty on Trade and Tariffs, and trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the European Union (EU).''Italic text'''''
The explosive beginning of our universe, the Big Bang marks the earliest time we can probe with current physical theory. Theory has to guide our understanding of the first fraction of a second, since we can’t recreate the extremely high temperatures that existed during the earliest history of the universe in any earthly laboratory. What theory tells us is that from an initial state in which matter and radiation are both in an extremely hot and dense form, the universe expands and the matter cools. At that time, it is believed that all four of the fundamental forces of nature—gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces—were unified.\\n\\n       The evolution of the earliest universe is not well understood because it is not clear exactly what laws were at work. However, it is known that by the end of the first second of time, the building blocks of matter had formed. By the end of the first three minutes, helium and other light nuclei (like deuterium) had formed but for a long time, temperatures remained too high for the formation of most atoms. At around one million years following the Big Bang, nuclei and electrons were at low enough temperatures to coalesce to form atoms. But the universe didn’t start to look like it does today until small perturbations in the matter distribution were able to condense to form the stars and galaxies we know today.
'''Hypercubiosis'''\\n\\nHypercubiosis (abbreviated as HCB) is not a common disease it is caused by fatal attraction.  Once the human eye is gazed upon a Nissan Cube humans mainly lose control of themselves. Hypercubiosis usually attacks the brain, but can also affect the central nervous system, the circulatory system, the genitourinary system, the gastrointestinal system, bones, joints, and even the skin!\\n\\nThe classic symptoms of Hypercubebiosis are a chronic desire to gaze at a Nissan cube, fever, weight loss, and even insomnia . Hypercubiosis treatment is difficult, the cost of treatment is still unknown.  Prevention relies on the individual.  One with a strong mind, will be able to resist temptation and will be able to forget the desire.  This is highly unlikely though.\\n\\nHypercubiosis has been spread across the internet. Today in modern day toronto, 500 people have fallen victim to this infectious disease.  The numbers are still increasing around Canada. However, most of these cases have not yet develop the full-blown disease.  Once in contact with the cube other side effects have been discovered.  Such side effects include extreme phases of mania and excitment.  Others side effects are still being studied.
Viral Influenza Shedding:  It appears that reliable information about viral shedding of Influenza A in general and the current H1N1 "Swine Flu" epidemic is not readily available. In order to rationally recommend quarantine of affected individuals in schools, work sites or other closed communities, it is necessary to know the rate at which affected individuals become less contagious to others. This page is intended to attract commentary from knowledgeable contributors about how rapidly  H1N1 infected individuals can be returned to their communities without unduly risking their colleagues. Although current public health policy recommends isolation from 5 to 10 days after the apparent onset of illness, the scientific basis for this recommendation seems obscure beyond experiments involving artificial viral infection with vaccination strains.
contingency plan\\n\\nA contingency plan is a plan devised for an exceptional risk that, though unlikely, would have catastrophic consequences. Contingency plans are often devised by governments or businesses. For example, suppose many employees of a company are traveling together on an aircraft which crashes, killing all aboard. The company could be severely strained or even ruined by such a loss. Accordingly, many companies have procedures to follow in the event of such a disaster. The plan may also include standing policies to mitigate a disaster's potential impact, such as requiring employees to travel separately or limiting the number of employees on any one aircraft.\\n\\nDuring times of crisis, contingency plans are often developed to explore and prepare for any eventualit
\\n'''Reasons For Unemployment in Kerala'''\\n\\nIt is interesting to know that the State with the highest literacy rate — almost 97 per cent — has the highest unemployment rate when compared to others. Kerala is known for large-scale migration of skilled labour to other States and countries. \\n\\nA few millions of people of the State have been working outside it for many years. Had they remained in Kerala, the unemployment rate would have been much higher than what was quoted in the article. \\n\\nWhat ails the State that has such a high literacy rate and is also blessed by vast natural resources? \\n\\nDoes the education system make people lethargic or rights-conscious or inefficient or unenterprising to start productive activities for their own progress? Does the education system make people more destructive in nature? \\n\\nNo industrialist wants to set up any industry in Kerala due to labour problems. The State is bankrupt, besides being corrupt and largely politicised. Trade unionism is still alive in Kerala. West Bengal was industrially ruined by the same attitude of the workers despite a highly skilled labour force. \\n\\nInstead of migrating to other States for jobs, Keralites should use their knowledge and expertise in establishing new productive activity on their own. Many of them should look at self-employment for overcoming the serious problem of unemployment.
