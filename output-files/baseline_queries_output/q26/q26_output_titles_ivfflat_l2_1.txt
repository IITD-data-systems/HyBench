\\n \\nGraphical description of risks and impacts from global warming from the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\nThe predicted effects of global warming on the environment and for human life are numerous and varied. It is generally difficult to attribute specific natural phenomena to long-term causes, but some effects of recent climate change may already be occurring. Raising sea levels, glacier retreat, Arctic shrinkage, and altered patterns of agriculture are cited as direct consequences, but predictions for secondary and regional effects include extreme weather events, an expansion of tropical diseases, changes in the timing of seasonal patterns in ecosystems, and drastic economic impact. Concerns have led to political activism advocating proposals to mitigate, eliminate, or adapt to it.\\nThe 2007 Fourth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) includes a summary of the expected effects.\\n\\n Global warming is responsible in part for some trends in natural disasters such as extreme weather\\n\\nLewis Glacier, North Cascades, WA USA is one of five glaciers in the area that melted away \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\nRetreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland
Home to millions of species,[11] including humans, Earth is the only place in the universe where life is known to exist. The planet formed 4.54 billion years ago,[12][13][14][15] and life appeared on its surface within a billion years. Since then, Earth's biosphere has significantly altered the atmosphere and other abiotic conditions on the planet, enabling the proliferation of aerobic organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which, together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks harmful radiation, permitting life on land.[16] The physical properties of the Earth, as well as its geological history and orbit, allowed life to persist during this period. The world is expected to continue supporting life for another 1.5 billion years, after which the rising luminosity of the Sun will eliminate the biosphere.[17]\\n\\nEarth's outer surface is divided into several rigid segments, or tectonic plates, that gradually migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of the surface is covered with salt-water oceans, the remainder consisting of continents and islands; liquid water, necessary for all known life, is not known to exist on any other planet's surface.[note 4][note 5] Earth's interior remains active, with a thick layer of relatively solid mantle, a liquid outer core that generates a magnetic field, and a solid iron inner core
Can you help translate this for me to swedish? Many thanks in advance!\\n\\n''The communist government allocated substantial resources to the development of agriculture. Large-scale programs of land reclamation, soil improvement, and irrigation, as well as increased use of fertilizers, all contributed to a significant expansion of agricultural production. Yet, despite impressive gains, agricultural production continues to be hindered by the persistence of traditional farming methods, low mechanization, and a lack of material incentives to encourage farmers to produce. This lasting legacy of the forced collectivization of agriculture and the abolition of private property has made it necessary to return land to the peasants and allow them to raise crops and livestock for private profit. The expansion of private agriculture is intended to pave the way for the introduction of new farming techniques and mechanization.''\\n\\n--[[User:Armour|Armour]] 14:27, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
Direct carbon conversion units could be used to generate electric power for the grid. Such a power plant would be "large, but not gigantic." Advanced combustion, fuel cells, nuclear and renewable energy, and conservation may all combine to help the situation in a way that cannot presently be predicted.It is vitally important to develop a simple fuel cell technology that greatly increases the yield of electric energy from each unit of fossil fuel, uses fuels derived efficiently from almost any fossil fuel, significantly decreases the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, and makes it easy to capture the carbon dioxide for sequestration or other use.Clearly, weâ€™re just beginning to hear about direct carbon conversion.
